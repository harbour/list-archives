MICROSOFT TESTS NUCLEAR DEVICE AT SECRET OLYMPIA 
FACILITY YESTERDAY

REDMOND (BNN)--World leaders reacted with stunned silence as 
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) conducted an underground nuclear test at 
a secret facility in Washington state. The device, exploded at 10:55 
am PDT (1:55 pm EDT) today, was timed to coincide with talks 
between Microsoft and the US Department of Justice over possible 
antitrust action.

"Microsoft is going to defend its right to market its products by any 
and all necessary means," said Microsoft CEO Bill Gates. "Not 
that I'm anti-government" he continued, "but there would be few 
tears shed in the computer industry if Washington were engulfed in 
a bath of nuclear fire."

Scientists pegged the explosion at around 100 kilotons. "I nearly 
dropped my latte when I saw the seismometer" explained 
University of Washington geophysicist Dr. Whoops Blammover, "At 
first I thought it was Mt. Rainier, and I was thinking, damn, there 
goes the mountain bike vacation."

In Washington, President Bush announced the US Government 
would boycott all Microsoft products indefinitely.  Minutes later, the 
President reversed his decision. "We've tried sanctions since 
lunchtime, and they don't work," said the President.  Instead, the 
administration will initiate a policy of "constructive engagement" 
with Microsoft.

Microsoft's Chief Technology Officer Nathan Myrhvold said the test 
justified Microsoft's recent acquisition of the Hanford Nuclear 
Reservation from the US Government. Not only did Microsoft 
acquire "kilograms of weapons grade plutonium" in the deal, said 
Myrhvold, "but we've finally found a place to dump those millions of 
unsold copies of Microsoft Bob."

Myrhvold warned users not to replace Microsoft NT products with rival operating systems. "I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of a radioisotope thermoelectric generator inside of every Pentium III microprocessor,
" said Myrhvold, "but anyone who installs an OS written by a bunch of long-hairs on the Internet is going to get what they deserve."

The existence of an RTG in each Pentium III microprocessor would explain why the microprocessors, made by the Intel Corporation, run so hot.  The  Intel chips "put out more heat than they draw in electrical power" said Pr
of. E. E. Thymes of MIT. "This should finally dispell those stories 
about cold fusion." 

Rumors suggest a second weapons development project is 
underway in California, headed by Microsoft rival Sun 
Microsystems. "They're doing all of the development work in Java," 
said one source close to the project.  The development of a delivery 
system is said to be holding up progress. "Write once, bomb 
anywhere is still a dream at the moment."

Meanwhile, in Cupertino, California, Apple interim-CEO Steve Jobs 
was rumored to be in discussion with Oracle CEO Larry Ellison 
about deploying Apple's Newton technology against Microsoft. 
"Newton was the biggest bomb the Valley has developed in years," 
said one hardware engineer. "I'd hate to be around when they drop 
that product a second time."

Highly unlikely, because Extended Systems has designed ADS 6 to fully
support 5.x client software. For example, there will not be a version 6
Clipper client, because Clipper can use the 5.x client to access both
5.x servers and 6.x servers.

Any good? What's been improved? I mean, I can always read the list of
additions/improvments on the website, but it's nice to hear it from a
developer's perspective.

 We should think about adding new possibilities of 6.0 to RDDADS and
 how it would be better to support both versions.

Is ADS *fully* working with Harbour now?
Are there any parts of ADS that are not finished yet in Harbour?

Mabster and Patrick:

ADS 6 does have new features that we could support.  They have a new Data
Dictionary that gives server-side enforcement of referential integrity...
* Complete referential integrity support including primary/foreign key
definition and cascaded updates and deletes
* Full server-based transaction processing eliminates database
corruption, drastically reducing support costs
* Advantage Extended Procedures provide easy-to-develop stored
procedures that are executed at the server

The Extended Procedures are the only element of interest for me at the
moment.  I have not been able to take the time to investigate the new
features as it is crunch time to get a product out the door here.

As for this:
> Is ADS *fully* working with Harbour now?
> Are there any parts of ADS that are not finished yet in Harbour?
...that's a bigger target than I've been able to shoot for.  My first goal
In adding on to Alexander's excellent start
was to get ADS fully integrated into the RDD (so straight RDD Harbour code
that is interchangeable with other RDDs would be fully supported without the
need for explicit ADS calls).
On this point we are *very* close with CDXs.  There are still a couple bugs
with scoping numeric indexes and relations that I will clean up soon, but
other than that it seems pretty solid, including automatic implementation of
AOFs.
There are undoubtedly several problems switching to ADT tables as they have
restrictions that can generate errors that we need to handle better (e.g.
deleted records are handled different, and record counts do NOT include
them).
Also, I haven't used Alexander's SQL support yet.

There are many functions in ADS that go beyond normal RDD activities.
Transaction processing and rollbacks should get done, and there's a handfull
of ads management functions that I'll do wrappers for.  But I doubt we
really need every available function available in Harbour.

I don't know what magazines you read but .NET architecture is far more than 
only a tool to gain market share. The .NET architecture is really a 
wonderful, time-saving and flexible way to develop. You can code (so far) 
in VB, C# (C Sharp), Cobol, ... There's no limit to this list since you can 
write a CLR compiler for any language.

Well, what things a language or technology does is not the issue. In my 
opinion the issue is *how* it does. And if it adds powerful features both 
to the programmer and for the user, why not? .NET is far more than Java.

Using Java trough the Internet is a great overhead. In ASP.Net you will 
have all the flexibility and power of VB.Net mixed with Classic ASP. About 
solidness, I think no language is solid until it reaches a mass of 
programmers. If solidness was the strong point on a starting up language, 
all the language developers should cease their work and I am including us. 
How solid is Harbour? See?

In my POV, Java and .NET implementations can live together and there's no 
need to choose between them. Once you see .NET running, I am sure you'll 
change your mind about the concept.

More or less like using any language to target the JVM then?

How would you want to document all the functions that are used by the RDD
but not called by the app programmer directly?
There's probably no point in saying "adsGoTop" is done since you can't call
that function directly, you just call dbGoTop.
We could make a list of those functions used by the rdd, but it's probably
more useful to say "all table and index functions are used by the rdd except
..." and list any that aren't supported yet.

I can try to create a list of supported funcs from the other categories...

I don't see how it could possibly be bad for ADS, but it has great
potential to be good for ADS.

According to the Extended Systems email that was sent to their esinews
mailing list, this is fantastic for Palm, who's primary purpose in

When I added Mark W. Schumann as a Harbour group member on SourceForge,
I noticed that they have some new features, such as listing each members
role in the group. All roles were displayed as "???", so I set all roles
to "Developer", with the following exceptions:

Dave Pearson: "Doc Writer" (the closest they had to "FAQ Maintainer").
Patrick Mast: "Web Designer" (the closest they had to "Web Master").
Phil Barnett: "Project Manager"

If anyone feels that they should be assigned a different role, please
speak up. The available roles are: Undefined, Developer, Project
Manager, Unix Admin, Support Manager, Doc Writer, Tester, Graphic/Other
Designer, Doc Translator, Editorial/Content Writer, Packager (.rpm,

Hi,

I have a Linux machine. I have installed a new Hard disk.
I have partitioned it (Fdisk) and formatted it.

How can I make it available on the network (Samba)
It is /dev/hdb1

I have already a shared HD partition on the linux machine.
So, Samba is alraedy installed.
The new drive is appended in the system.

How can I do that?

You edit /etc/smb.conf to tell it about the share, "man 5 smb.conf" tells
you all about what goes in that file.

Failing that, the chances are that your distribution (which one are you
using?) comes with a utility called `linuxconf'. It usually provides a
point-n-shoot interface for doing this sort of thing:

What's the command to copy the "smb.conf" file to a diskette?

That depends on the type of filesystem you've got on the diskette in
question. Assuming you've aiming to use a FAT formatted disk, take a look at
the mtools ("man mtools" for details). In particular, take a look at mcopy
("man mcopy").

Out of interest, why the desire to copy it to a floppy?

Well, personally, I would install webmin and the samba interface is 
quite excellent.

Or, there is direct editing of smb.conf.

There is probably an editor named joe. It emulated the old wordstar 
keystrokes.

 Aren't you have mc ( Midnight Commander - Linux replacement of Norton
 Commander ) ? I think that it is the most convenient tool for Dos
 users.

What's so hard about using a copy command? There is a more consistent method
(which I guess is what you'd consider "not hard") but that requires a little
more explanation and learning, it seemed sensible to point you to a direct
route if you were using FAT formatted floppy disks. Learn how to mount and
you've got the problem cracked no matter the type of filesystem.

Extra power requires a little bit of extra learning, that's all.

He's suggesting that you install webmin, not samba (which you've obviously
already got installed). If you encounter the name of an item of free
software and you don't know what it is or where to find it you should always
consult <URL:http://freshmeat.net/>.

I pointed you at the information that documents the file. I've pointed to
one possible tool for editing it (you've not said if it's available to you
or not) and Phil's pointed you to another. On top of that Samba comes with
lots of excellent documentation, it even comes with example configuration
files that demonstrates what you need to do and how you need to do it (and
it has done since 1996, which is when I first read that documentation and
first shared a directory off my Linux box).

man smb.conf to start. Look in the file for clues on how the first 
drive was shared and emulate it.
