Message-ID: <3A832C64.A3F6F0@nh.conex.com.br>

Dear Antonio,Ignacio and Maurilio

Nice job you done to the debugger.

Now my remarks

Antonio

The follow dont show propely

Public variables on the monitor window if the function have local var
Btw can you move the local variable addition to the  ::avars  to the
load vars() method

Second, please  notify me when you all has finish doing changes to the
debugger. 

I have the follow to upload, but since your upload speed is faster then
my.(i have to download the latest changes, and apply the changes again)
-Multiple source file support
-the Show all/only one type of variables on the monitor window.
-Some changes to the call stack window

Regards

Luiz Rafael Culik
