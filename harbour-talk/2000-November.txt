Subject: [HarbourTalk] CopyRight

<PRE>Hi.

A question about Copy Right.

One header File have copy right ?

GOTO END IF NO TRUE  : )))

It is true, i can do a new header and put my own copy right, changing,
adding or renaming any commands and voala ?

If not is possible, how harbour have a own table of defines (inside course),
idem like clipper, and dont says, &quot;Copy right of clipper (CA)&quot;. The defines
used by harbour differs a little from clipper.

What is the different ?

Can any one explain me ?

I'm not certain about what you're asking here.

Neither am I certain about what you're asking here either. Are you asking if
you can take someone's copyrighted work, make some modification and replace
the copyright message with your own?

&gt;<i> If not is possible, how harbour have a own table of defines (inside

</I>&gt;<i> The defines used by harbour differs a little from clipper.
</I>
If the defines were copied directly out of the CA-Clipper files then there
is a problem. Is there any evidence that these rules were not cleanly
implemented but were instead cut and pasted from the CA-Clipper code?

</I>Dave, i put you an example in two commands for a compiler.

File1.ch

//
// CopyRight of Clipper (CA)
//
#command DISPLAY [&lt;list,...&gt;][&lt;off:OFF&gt;][&lt;toPrint: TO PRINTER&gt;][TO FILE
&lt;(toFile)&gt;] ;
[FOR &lt;for&gt;][WHILE &lt;while&gt;][NEXT &lt;next&gt;][RECORD

&lt;rec&gt;, &lt;.rest.&gt;,  &lt;.toPrint.&gt;, &lt;(toFile)&gt; )

And then Gustavo or xxx person, read, learn an do it....

//
// XXX
//
#command DISPLAY [&lt;lista,...&gt;][&lt;off:OFF&gt;][&lt;toPrint: TO PRINTER&gt;][TO FILE

&lt;rec&gt;, &lt;.rest.&gt;,  &lt;.toPrint.&gt;, &lt;(toArc)&gt; )

You think that the new command DISPLAY, have been &quot;cleanly implemented&quot; ?

What you think about it new command ?

Like the XXX person, need compatibility with the old command (clipper CA),
obviuosly the principal clausules are idem, certain vars are changed and
newly implemented. ?

Dave, please don't take my question from a bad side, i only need to be
clear, and know to where i can do.

I ask you, because you know more than me about licences and so forth.

Hey, where is the direction of  [ From The Free On-line Dictionary of

*** Again....

You think that may be posible that i can include a header file (xx.ch), in
any program, but without the copyright text from it original creator ?

I can put in any programs (like an example), the inkey.ch ?, or, std.ch, or
any header ?

What do you think about this ?

Sorry, but I'm still not sure what you are asking here. Are you asking if it
is possible for a header file to be controlled by copyright? Are you asking
if any of the header files that are part of harbour are controlled by
copyright? Or are you asking something else?

&gt;<i> I ask you, because you know more than me about licences and so forth.
</I>
Licences and copyright, although related, are slightly different issues. For
starters, your questions will have different answers depending on the
licences terms granted by the copyright holder.

&gt;<i> Hey, where is the direction of [ From The Free On-line Dictionary of
</I>&gt;<i> Computing ]
</I>
I'm not sure where the original version lives (I'm betting that a search
using your web-search engine of choice will point you in the right
direction). The version I've got here is rendered as a source file for use
with the dictionary server dictd &lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.dictd.org/">http://www.dictd.org/</A>&gt;.

&gt;<i> You think that may be posible that i can include a header file (xx.ch), in
</I>&gt;<i> any program, but without the copyright text from it original creator ?
</I>
What do you mean by include? What are the terms of the licence for the file?
Have you asked the copyright holder what they think about it? Have you asked
the copyright holder if they'll grant you a licence tailored for your needs?

&gt;<i> I can put in any programs (like an example), the inkey.ch ?, or, std.ch,
</I>&gt;<i> or any header ?
</I>
Sorry, I don't understand this question.

Given the complexity of the issues you raise I'm concerned that I can't
answer your questions correctly due to the language barrier. Even then, if
we shared the same native language I'd be unhappy to answer the kinds of
questions you seem to be asking. It seems that you're asking these questions
because you want to act on them. If this is the case you should be talking
to both a) the copyright holder of the files in question and b) your legal
resource.

So, i am here, and if i need use the header files like say in old past

When i say relax, was a word for &quot;take it easy&quot;, if not was the best choice,

<PRE>Phil,

First of all apologize for the confirmation mails (probably) sent to the list.

But:

Why is that if I simply reply to the confirmation request mail, the reply address 
is the list itself instead of the request confirmation email address ? I think this way 
it's very easy to make a mistake. Now I also understand why I've seen several 
such messages appearing on the list. I'm using Outlook Express 5.5.

Could you please check this ?

-----------------------------------------------


For nearly two years, I've been managing an open source project 
named the Harbour Project. (Source Forge CVS)

In this letter, I'd like to introduce you to some of the advanced 
capabilities we have been working on and some enhancements we 
have made to the Harbour Project compiler and our implementation 
of the xBase language.

The Harbour Project is a cross platform Clipper 5.x workalike 
compiler with major additions since Computer Associates has 
stopped upgrading the Clipper language.

With the strong foundation inherited from one of the most popular 
business xBase language compilers and the recent advances in 
language and compiler features and technology, we feel that we 
have embraced the entire capabilities of the original Clipper 
compiler and enhanced it with an open architecture that will extend 
the life of this language for years to come.

One of the many strong features of Clipper and now, Harbour 
Project is the language preprocessor. While we were in the early 
stages of designing the Harbour Project, I requested that we create 
the preprocessor in a way that would allow it to be split off from our 
compiler and capable of standalone execution. This allows other 
languages to use this powerful addition to create plain english 
language with tagged parameterization capabilities. In plain 
english, this means that you can create a directive in your header 
files that will transform 'arbitrary order instructions' into 'functional 
parameter lists'. 

Phew, what the heck does that mean???

Let's see an example:  

Using a snippet of the the built in preprocessor header file, 
(normally included in every compile automatically) STD.CH, we see 
this directive:  

(you may need to switch this to Courier font)

#command USE &lt;(db)&gt;                             ;
             [VIA &lt;rdd&gt;]                        ;
             [ALIAS &lt;a&gt;]                        ;
             [&lt;new: NEW&gt;]                       ;
             [&lt;ex: EXCLUSIVE&gt;]                  ;
             [&lt;sh: SHARED&gt;]                     ;
             [&lt;ro: READONLY&gt;]                   ;
             [INDEX &lt;(index1)&gt; [, &lt;(indexn)&gt;]]  ;
                                     ;
      =&gt; dbUseArea(                             ;
             &lt;.new.&gt;, &lt;rdd&gt;, &lt;(db)&gt;, &lt;(a)&gt;,     ;
  if(&lt;.sh.&gt; .or. &lt;.ex.&gt;, !&lt;.ex.&gt;, NIL), &lt;.ro.&gt;  ;
                  )                             ;
                                     ;
      [; dbSetIndex( &lt;(index1)&gt; )]              ;
      [; dbSetIndex( &lt;(indexn)&gt; )]


This preprocessor directive begins with a #command, which 
signifies the beginning of the directive, and in the middle, we see 
the =&gt; which signifies the break between $command and directive 
target. In the command area we see parameters surrounded with [], 
which means they are optional.  

In real life use, this #command makes it much easier to remember 
how to use the 'USE' command.  

We can use either of the following commands to perform the same 
functions.  

USE foobar EXCLUSIVE INDEX foodex READONLY

or

USE foobar INDEX foodex READONLY EXCLUSIVE  

Notice that the parameters in the above example do not have to be 
in any specific order. The preprocessor will read either of the above 
two lines of code and translate them both to the identical:  

dbUseArea( .f.,, 'foobar', .t., .t. )
dbSetIndex( 'foodex' )

We no longer have to remember the order of the parameters of a 
function, nor what they stand for. Instead, we can use a more 
englishlike substitute and let the preprocessor sort it out.  

Over the years, many parts of the Clipper language and now 
Harbour Project 'functions' have been transformed into arbitrary 
order 'commands'. Often, this means that you no longer have to 
look up the function in a manual to see what order the parameters 
should be used. This makes any language more natural and easier 
to remember and use. In fact, our Object Orientation makes heavy 
use of the preprocessor to turn englishlike commands into complex 
OO functions.

This is only one of the features of what will soon be one of the most 
feature laden and powerful compilers available on the Linux platform.

Harbour Project is still in alpha status and is nearly two years into 
development. Currently, Source Forge shows us as #117 of over 
11,000 projects. Often, we have been as high as #20. A team of 
dedicated programmers are working around the clock and 
worldwide to make this one of the best third generation compilers 
available anywhere.

Some other features that we have added to the Harbour Project 
above and beyond where Nantucket and Computer Associates left 
Clipper...

Strong or weak variable typing
Dynamic Garbage collection
Dynamic Stack
Replacable data drivers beyond .DBF files
Full object orientation including Polymorphism, Encapsulation, 
multiple inheritance, scoping, forwarding and delegating
Scripting (Runtime Compiling)
Compile time expression optimizer
Idle state handling

...and, we have worked very hard on several other initiatives during 
this process:

Currently, there are 36 different language modules, so it is easy to 
have the basic runtime library text interfaces available in any 
language. Support for other languages is a tranlation away for 
anyone who is interested. That's the glory of Open Source!

Harbour Project compiles and runs on 5 target platforms. Linux, 
DOS, OS/2, Win16, Win32, and there has been effort to support 
Macintosh but that effort is not current.

The Harbour Project team members have been impressive 
participants, both in their outstanding coding talent and their 
dedication to sticking with this until we have a viable product.  This 
international team is currently working on integrating the RDD 
(Replacable Data Driver) layers. We are working on native .DBF, 
MySQL on Linux, MSQL, ADS, ODBC and there is an aftermarket 
company developing Oracle, Sybase and MS SQL support.

There are also aftermarket companies developing very advanced 
GUI libraries. Many of  these aftermarket companies are drawing 
from over a decade of experience with serious commercial 
development in Clipper.

Our help system is capable of outputting the following types of help 
files:

TXT - plain ASCII text format
    - plain ASCII text format without Form-Feed
RTF - Rich text format
NGI - Norton Guide source
IPF - OS/2 help source code
PDF - Adobe Portable Document
HTM - HTML output
CHM - HTML source files for Windows .CHM Help files
HPC - HelpC source file
TRF - Linux TROFF code

I'm really excited as the capabilities of the Harbour Project 
compiler takes on a very professional and capable look and feel. I 
expect to see beta status soon, but being open source, that will 
depend on volunteer participation. This is a feature rich compiler. It 
takes time.

You can visit the Harbour Project home page at <A HREF="http://www.harbour-">http://www.harbour-</A>
project.org, where you will find links to the native c compilers that 
we use to create our compiler and other language tools that are 
necessary to build the language parser. If any of you are C coders 
and are interested in participating in the continuing development 
process, please feel free to join our developers mailing list and help 
us out.

Harbour Power!

I'd suggest &quot;compatible&quot; instead of &quot;workalike&quot; and I'd also suggest
emphasising that it's the language that is compatible. I'd also not mention
the but about Computer Associates. I'd simply state that harbour is also a

It's either &quot;The Harbour Project&quot; (the project to develop harbour) or
&quot;Harbour&quot; (the compiler and attendant tools and libraries).

Marketing hype and a little too 3l33t3 dUdE.

I see where you're coming from with this but I'm not sure that highlighting
the pre-processor (for example) makes much sense. Personally I'd talk about
how Harbour is a free software effort to keep alive a language that seems to
have lost the support of non-free implementors. I'd probably also talk about
how a community has used free software principles to create and maintain
it's own implementation so as to free itself from any single non-free
vendor.

The measure was some kind of combined activity factor on

Also, the example, while informative seems to be summarized well by a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the many strong features of Clipper and now, Harbour
</I>&gt;<i> Project is the language preprocessor. While we were in the early
</I>&gt;<i> stages of designing the Harbour Project, I requested that we create
</I>&gt;<i> the preprocessor in a way that would allow it to be split off from our
</I>&gt;<i> compiler and capable of standalone execution. This allows other
</I>&gt;<i> languages to use this powerful addition to create plain english
</I>&gt;<i> language with tagged parameterization capabilities. In plain
</I>&gt;<i> english, this means that you can create a directive in your header
</I>&gt;<i> files that will transform 'arbitrary order instructions' into 'functional
</I>&gt;<i> parameter lists'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Phew, what the heck does that mean???
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's see an example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using a snippet of the the built in preprocessor header file,
</I>&gt;<i> (normally included in every compile automatically) STD.CH, we see
</I>&gt;<i> this directive:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (you may need to switch this to Courier font)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #command USE &lt;(db)&gt;                             ;
</I>&gt;<i>              [VIA &lt;rdd&gt;]                        ;
</I>&gt;<i>              [ALIAS &lt;a&gt;]                        ;
</I>&gt;<i>              [&lt;new: NEW&gt;]                       ;
</I>&gt;<i>              [&lt;ex: EXCLUSIVE&gt;]                  ;
</I>&gt;<i>              [&lt;sh: SHARED&gt;]                     ;
</I>&gt;<i>              [&lt;ro: READONLY&gt;]                   ;
</I>&gt;<i>              [INDEX &lt;(index1)&gt; [, &lt;(indexn)&gt;]]  ;
</I>&gt;<i>                                      ;
</I>&gt;<i>       =&gt; dbUseArea(                             ;
</I>&gt;<i>              &lt;.new.&gt;, &lt;rdd&gt;, &lt;(db)&gt;, &lt;(a)&gt;,     ;
</I>&gt;<i>   if(&lt;.sh.&gt; .or. &lt;.ex.&gt;, !&lt;.ex.&gt;, NIL), &lt;.ro.&gt;  ;
</I>&gt;<i>                   )                             ;
</I>&gt;<i>                                      ;
</I>&gt;<i>       [; dbSetIndex( &lt;(index1)&gt; )]              ;
</I>&gt;<i>       [; dbSetIndex( &lt;(indexn)&gt; )]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This preprocessor directive begins with a #command, which
</I>&gt;<i> signifies the beginning of the directive, and in the middle, we see
</I>&gt;<i> the =&gt; which signifies the break between $command and directive
</I>&gt;<i> target. In the command area we see parameters surrounded with [],
</I>&gt;<i> which means they are optional.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In real life use, this #command makes it much easier to remember
</I>&gt;<i> how to use the 'USE' command.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can use either of the following commands to perform the same
</I>&gt;<i> functions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> USE foobar EXCLUSIVE INDEX foodex READONLY
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> USE foobar INDEX foodex READONLY EXCLUSIVE
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Notice that the parameters in the above example do not have to be
</I>&gt;<i> in any specific order. The preprocessor will read either of the above
</I>&gt;<i> two lines of code and translate them both to the identical:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> dbUseArea( .f.,, 'foobar', .t., .t. )
</I>&gt;<i> dbSetIndex( 'foodex' )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We no longer have to remember the order of the parameters of a
</I>&gt;<i> function, nor what they stand for. Instead, we can use a more
</I>&gt;<i> englishlike substitute and let the preprocessor sort it out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over the years, many parts of the Clipper language and now
</I>&gt;<i> Harbour Project 'functions' have been transformed into arbitrary
</I>&gt;<i> order 'commands'. Often, this means that you no longer have to
</I>&gt;<i> look up the function in a manual to see what order the parameters
</I>&gt;<i> should be used. This makes any language more natural and easier
</I>&gt;<i> to remember and use. In fact, our Object Orientation makes heavy
</I>&gt;<i> use of the preprocessor to turn englishlike commands into complex
</I>&gt;<i> OO functions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is only one of the features of what will soon be one of the most

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Harbour Project is still in alpha status and is nearly two years into

<PRE>Phil,

Great work (I for one, believe that &quot;marketing hype&quot; is a must, and a given,
in any promotional effort).

Do you think any mention of SimpLex might be beneficial? It might be of
interest to other Compiler Related projects/developer.

Ron

&gt;<i> Please review this for technical accuracy. I'd like to submit it to

</I>&gt;<i> -----------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For nearly two years, I've been managing an open source project
</I>&gt;<i> named the Harbour Project. (Source Forge CVS)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this letter, I'd like to introduce you to some of the advanced
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities we have been working on and some enhancements we
</I>&gt;<i> have made to the Harbour Project compiler and our implementation
</I>&gt;<i> of the xBase language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Harbour Project is a cross platform Clipper 5.x workalike
</I>&gt;<i> compiler with major additions since Computer Associates has
</I>&gt;<i> stopped upgrading the Clipper language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the strong foundation inherited from one of the most popular
</I>&gt;<i> business xBase language compilers and the recent advances in
</I>&gt;<i> language and compiler features and technology, we feel that we
</I>&gt;<i> have embraced the entire capabilities of the original Clipper
</I>&gt;<i> compiler and enhanced it with an open architecture that will extend
</I>&gt;<i> the life of this language for years to come.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the many strong features of Clipper and now, Harbour
</I>&gt;<i> Project is the language preprocessor. While we were in the early
</I>&gt;<i> stages of designing the Harbour Project, I requested that we create
</I>&gt;<i> the preprocessor in a way that would allow it to be split off from our
</I>&gt;<i> compiler and capable of standalone execution. This allows other
</I>&gt;<i> languages to use this powerful addition to create plain english
</I>&gt;<i> language with tagged parameterization capabilities. In plain
</I>&gt;<i> english, this means that you can create a directive in your header
</I>&gt;<i> files that will transform 'arbitrary order instructions' into 'functional
</I>&gt;<i> parameter lists'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Phew, what the heck does that mean???
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's see an example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using a snippet of the the built in preprocessor header file,
</I>&gt;<i> (normally included in every compile automatically) STD.CH, we see
</I>&gt;<i> this directive:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (you may need to switch this to Courier font)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #command USE &lt;(db)&gt;                             ;
</I>&gt;<i>              [VIA &lt;rdd&gt;]                        ;
</I>&gt;<i>              [ALIAS &lt;a&gt;]                        ;
</I>&gt;<i>              [&lt;new: NEW&gt;]                       ;
</I>&gt;<i>              [&lt;ex: EXCLUSIVE&gt;]                  ;
</I>&gt;<i>              [&lt;sh: SHARED&gt;]                     ;
</I>&gt;<i>              [&lt;ro: READONLY&gt;]                   ;
</I>&gt;<i>              [INDEX &lt;(index1)&gt; [, &lt;(indexn)&gt;]]  ;
</I>&gt;<i>                                      ;
</I>&gt;<i>       =&gt; dbUseArea(                             ;
</I>&gt;<i>              &lt;.new.&gt;, &lt;rdd&gt;, &lt;(db)&gt;, &lt;(a)&gt;,     ;
</I>&gt;<i>   if(&lt;.sh.&gt; .or. &lt;.ex.&gt;, !&lt;.ex.&gt;, NIL), &lt;.ro.&gt;  ;
</I>&gt;<i>                   )                             ;
</I>&gt;<i>                                      ;
</I>&gt;<i>       [; dbSetIndex( &lt;(index1)&gt; )]              ;
</I>&gt;<i>       [; dbSetIndex( &lt;(indexn)&gt; )]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This preprocessor directive begins with a #command, which
</I>&gt;<i> signifies the beginning of the directive, and in the middle, we see
</I>&gt;<i> the =&gt; which signifies the break between $command and directive

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> dbUseArea( .f.,, 'foobar', .t., .t. )

</I>&gt;<i> We no longer have to remember the order of the parameters of a

</I>&gt;<i> to remember and use. In fact, our Object Orientation makes heavy
</I>&gt;<i> use of the preprocessor to turn englishlike commands into complex
</I>&gt;<i> OO functions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is only one of the features of what will soon be one of the most
</I>&gt;<i> feature laden and powerful compilers available on the Linux platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Harbour Project is still in alpha status and is nearly two years into
</I>&gt;<i> development. Currently, Source Forge shows us as #117 of over
</I>&gt;<i> 11,000 projects. Often, we have been as high as #20. A team of
</I>&gt;<i> dedicated programmers are working around the clock and
</I>&gt;<i> worldwide to make this one of the best third generation compilers
</I>&gt;<i> available anywhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some other features that we have added to the Harbour Project

</I>&gt;<i> Idle state handling
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...and, we have worked very hard on several other initiatives during

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Harbour Project compiles and runs on 5 target platforms. Linux,
</I>&gt;<i> DOS, OS/2, Win16, Win32, and there has been effort to support

So you're not too far from New York either. The really nice thing is that
California is only a couple of hours away too.

Hype and promotion are two different things. Hype says desperate to me, I
don't think I'm alone in this.

Promoting free software is fine, resorting to hype and marketing-speak
misses the point IMNSHO. I'm confident Phil will understand and appreciate
what I was saying.

So, it's only really a measure of how &quot;busy&quot; the project is. About as useful
a measure (and as worth mentioning) as BogoMips perhaps?

[Aside]

I'm sure some will see my comments in response to Phil's RFC as overly
negative. Actually I think Phil's idea of writing to the LJ is an excellent
idea (as someone whose had a subscription since 1997 I've been thinking of
writing and submitting an article). I'd just hate to see &quot;fluffy&quot; text sent
in, the LJ is already loosing its way as it is, I'd like to think that a
letter or an article about harbour might, in some small way, bolster the
flagging free software content of what was once an excellent magazine.

I'm saying: lets talk about what harbour has done and where it is as a free
software project, lets not engage in the tick-list-oriented babble that's
usually found in the non-free software world.

Subject: [HarbourTalk] Mailman Upgrade.

<PRE>I am going to perform a Mailman upgrade to 2.0rc2.

I've been waiting for them to resolve a lost messages issue and it 
looks like they got it a few days ago.

Now, they have released a release candidate.

I'm configuring it and make-ing it tonight. There may be a slight 
delay for some messages. I'll be sending test messages during 
this test to Harbour Talk when I get it back up, and a notice here 
when the upgrade is done. If you see anything funny after that 
notice, please report it to me immediately. I'll do what I can even up 
to reverting to the prior version if necessary. Hopefully, it will 
upgrade nicely.

Boy, has this created a storm on the Mailman list.

I have a patch. I'll be applying it RSN.

Yes, it's reported.

It seems that the new version has the archives in a different 
location than the old version, and it's a bug. Once the new version 
points to the populated directory, everything will work.

I'm awaiting a bugfix.

The "rc3" in the version number probably means "release candidate". So
v20.0rc1 would have been the first release candidate, rc2 the second, rc3
the third and then, if no further bugs were found, rc3 would become v2.0
proper.

IOW, it's an upgrade to a "stable" release, not a downgrade.

Mailman 2.0 was final released about two weeks ago. I watched 
the developer list and user list and it appeared to be stable, so I 
upgraded us to the final release.

As far as I know, the final release was identical to rc3.
