Hi,

is there a Borland C 5.5 Master Online now?
I need info on a BYTE init.

Hi,

I have this sample from MS Visual C++ and I need to compile it with BCC5.5:

BYTE * pResized = new BYTE[uNewW * uNewH *3];

The error it gives is:
Error E2140 test.c 24: Declaration is not allowed here in function WinMain
Error E2451 test.c 24: Undefined symbol 'new' in function WinMain
Error E2141 test.c 24: Declaration syntax error in function WinMain

Thanks!

Patrick,

That sounds like you're not #include'ing whichever .h file defines BYTE.

As a test, put a line above that one like

#define BYTE int

I know it's wrong, but at least it'll tell you whether that's the problem. 
If that compiles, then remove the line and look for the appropriate .h 
file (I'm not sure which one it is).

Are you sure you've compiling it as C++ code? The fact that you've given it
a .c extension suggests you're writing C code (and I seem to recall that
Borland's compiler takes a clue from the file extension in the absence of
other hints).

`new' is C++, not C.

You are right!
Renaming test.c to test.cpp changed the whole thing!

Right, it doesn't matter.

Anyhow, I would suggest you to start learning C before
learn C++.

Antonio,

I need some help...
I have a drnview.cpp source code compiled with this:
bcc32 -tW -c -Ic:\harbour\include;c:\bcc55\include drnview.cpp

Than I nake the DLL with this:
tlib  drjpg+drnview

Than I use the functions from inside the drnview.cpp
IMGInit() and JPGResize()

In buildh.bat I added this line:
echo DrJPG.lib iSOurce.lib              + >> b32.bc

and right this after loading FiveH.lib

But compiling my PRG i get this:
C:\fwh\Html Album>c:\bc55\bin\ilink32 -Gn -aa -Tpe -s -v @b32.bc
Turbo Incremental Link 5.00 Copyright (c) 1997, 2000 Borland

What can be wrong?
The CPP file?

Have a look at FWH Clip3hrb.prg code. You will see how we
add HB_FUN_ to the funcions names.

I don't have that file...

Here's the source of the JPGResize():
(  It looks good to me ;-))  )

#include "windows.h"

}


// iJPGResize(cSource,cDest,nWidth,nHeight)

{
  LPSTR  cSource = (LPSTR)  hb_parc (1);
  LPSTR  cDest   = (LPSTR)  hb_parc (2);
  UINT32 uWidth  = (UINT32) hb_parni(3);
  UINT32 uHeight = (UINT32) hb_parni(4);
  UINT32 nQty    = (UINT32) hb_parni(5);

  UINT32 uOrgWidth;
  UINT32 uOrgHeight;

  HGLOBAL hSource;
  HGLOBAL hDest;
  HGLOBAL hResized;

  // Open JPG
  hSource  = _ISOpenFileSource ( cSource );
  hResized = _ISReadJPG ( hSource, &uOrgWidth, &uOrgHeight, 24 );
  _ISCloseSource(hSource);

  // Resize
  BYTE * pResized = new BYTE[uWidth * uHeight *3];
  _ISResizeImage((BYTE *)hResized, uOrgWidth, uOrgHeight, pResized, uWidth,
uHeight, 3);

  // Get a destination manager
  hDest = _ISOpenFileDest ( cDest );
  if (hDest!=NULL)
  {
     _ISWriteJPG(hDest, pResized, uWidth, uHeight, nQty, 1 , 24, NULL);
     _ISCloseDest(hDest);
  }

  // Free memory blocks
  GlobalFree ( hSource );
  GlobalFree ( hResized );
  delete [] pResized;
  hb_retl(0);
}


What is wrong?

You're building this as C++, right? Are you sure that you're building this
such that the two functions above don't have their names passed via the name
mangling mechanism?

I'd also suggest that you might want to look at writing these functions so
that they're portable (IOW no Win32 specific stuff). It strikes me that JPG
manipulation code doesn't need to be tied to one platform.

I disagree. I think that it is better to start with C++ than to have to
unlearn all of the bad habits that will come from having learned C first.

Is this different if we make the c code in C or C++?

This is how I build the lib:
,----
| bcc32 -tW -c -I%hdir%\include;%bcdir%\include drnview.cpp
| tlib Drjpg +Drnview
`--------------

Also tried:
,-----
|bcc32 -c -I%hdir%\include;%bcdir%\include drnview.cpp
|tlib Drjpg +Drnview
`--------------

What can be wrong?

Let me first try this in C++, than I can try to make it in ANSI C and
platform independant. ;-))

Yes. It's also different if you tell the C++ compiler that certain functions
are C code (see your compiler's documentation for the 'extern "C"'
directive) or, at the very least, shouldn't be name-mangled.

<URL:http://www.hagbard.demon.co.uk/clipper-faq/clipper-8.html#ss8.12> is
worth reading at this point.

Sorry, can't tell anything useful from that because I don't use Borland C++
on Win32 (actually, I don't use any Win32 C++ compiler). Perhaps the manual
for your compiler will tell you something useful about the command line
switches you're using?

Are you saying that the pointer to the FAQ didn't help?

BTW, this isn't a C problem so asking "C gurus" won't help. It's either a
C++ problem or it's a C++ implementation problem, we'll know if it's the
latter once you've actually discounted the FAQ pointer I gave you as the
cause of your problem.

I'm getting nothing, it would appear, from where I'm sat, that the server
for that site isn't responding.

What sorts of complaints are you getting and what are you hoping people can
test for you?

To see what I saw, visit http://www.jsd0.com/test/ (you *must* include
the "/" after "test") where you will find site3.gif (for teste2),
site2.gif (for body2.swf), and site1.gif (for body1.swf). The files are
75% quality JPEG images captured from NS 4.7. Things didn't look any
better with IE 5.5...

Felipe,
I don't have ShockWave installed on my browser (Netscape 3.04)
so accessing the two swf files give me a request to save/download
those files (which is not the point of course).
as for teste2:
I get the animated banner at the top,
the cf.jpg at the bottom left with the green (barrafim.jpg) bar below.
and 3 places where the ShockWave media should be shown.

  Chen.

Hi,

I cannot add or remove users anymore... Going to "Start", "Programms",
"Administration Tools", "Active directory users and computers" Win 2000
says:
,--------
| Naming information cannot be located:
| The specified domain either does not exists or could not be contacted."
`--------------------------
I used Active Directory in the past on that machine... It suddenly stopped
working.

This is a web server with DNS installed. Can I remove Active Directory?

fyi - 

	This is pretty frightening, if it comes to fruition. 
Now the media and software industry is trying to
control what we write on our own hard drives, and
breaking interoperability with existing technology
(raid, backup software, other disks & removable media)
in the process.

http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/2/15620.html

	It's a link from /.

	I could say something about how this technology would
aid in protecting proprietary, closed source software
written with open source tools, but I won't ;)

This is not new. In the past the Industry try to control software
through the ID number of every hard disk of the main brands.
Later came the DAT fiasco in the audio area, and currently the
delayed massive acceptance of DVD, due to stupid restriction area.
Seems Industry never learn the lesson.

I think we should charge for this service.  After all, the storage space is
