Luiz, this isn't the first chain/hoax you've sent to people by the harbour

April 7). Perhaps you could drop the harbour lists from your target audience

I'm mostly just lurking and have hardly touched any Harbour code, so
count this for what it's worth.

But, in my opinion, a developers' mailing list should be free of all
kinds of virus alerts.  I suppose one possible exception would be to
warn when an email virus may have actually been spread by the list itself.

I would guess that people who develop Harbour tend to get a _lot_
of email.  If the virus alerts are making the rounds, we'll get them
elsewhere without having to read about them on harbourtalk.

Presumably this is the reason he sent the email to the social list, not the
developers list?

Yeah, you're right.

I meant to say something like "a social list made up of developers."

My point is that the kind of people who would be on this list are likely
to be the kind of people who always get these alerts on every _other_
list they read too.  And they include people like you and me, who are
very, very rarely affected by even the "true" alerts.

Anyone here who reads Slashdot <URL:http://slashdot.org/> will (hopefully)
have seen <URL:http://www.paulgraham.com/paulgraham/avg.html>. I'd urge
anyone who hasn't seen it to follow the link and have a read of the paper.

I think it's interesting for Clipper/harbour programmers on a couple of
levels. _The Blub Paradox_ will probably resonate with many Clipper
programmers for a couple of reasons (both positive and negative). I think
the whole of the paper will resonate with Clipper/Harbour programmers too,
especially now that Clipper is much less the norm and heading into
historical exception territory (talk about the rise of garbage collection
usage should also have a few heads nodding).

For me I found that the paper did a good job of explaining why I like
Clipper (the language) and Lisp.

 Really interesting.
 I ever tell that Clipper is a higher-level language than C, Pascal,
 etc. Now I believe, that Lisp is, too.

Hi,

I have noticed that database access on a Windows 2000, acting
as a server, is VERY slow...

I have made is a little application to test the speed of the network
traffic on accessing database files. Please find it here:
http://www.FiveWin.Be.kz/files/Test_Network_Speed.zip

Unzip these files and place them on a networkdrive.

Run tServer.exe on the server computer, and run tClient on the
clients computer. When tServer.exe is run, it will create a "TEST.DBF"
file and put some data in it. It opens the TEST.DBF in shared mode.

Now, if you run tClient.exe on the clients computer, it wil open and
close the TEST.DBF 10 times. As a result it will report how long it
needed to do this.

On my system (Windows 2000 Professional on the server and clients
computer) I have these results:

,-[ NOT RUNNING tServer ]---------------
|0.68 second to open TEST.DBF 10 times
`---------------------------------------

,-[ RUNNING tServer ]-------------------
|10.38 second to open TEST.DBF 10 times!!
`---------------------------------------
That's 10 seconds longer!!

What can be the cause, and more important, how can we solve it?

Please run the test and let me know the result.
Thanks for your cooperation!

the same result...

Now there's a language I've been meaning to really get into for a long time.
I dabbled with it many years ago but never got serious about it. Do you have
any recommendations for a good book on the language?

 The only book which I have is 'Starting FORTH. An introduction to the
 FORTH language and operating system for beginners and professionals' by
 Leo Brodie and FORTH,INC. This is an excellent book, I read it with a
 great pleasure.

Thanks Alexander, I'll have a look out for this (sounds like a good one to
add to my Amazon wishlist).

Hey, hang on a moment, "operating system". Operating system? Really? There's
a Forth operating system? At this point I'm reminded of the Jupiter Ace (you
might recall that while other micro computers were bundling BASIC in ROM it
came with FORTH, I really wish I'd gone for one of them at the time instead
of saving up for a ZX81).

 Yes, Forth really was used as operating system for microcomputers,
 controllers, embedded systems. There was also Forth computers with
 processors, designed specially for Forth.
 The first ( and last ) time when I saw it and had a possibility to play
 with it was special terminals for one of IBM 360/370 clones, these
 terminals was based on 8086 processor and had some internal software.
 Couple of years ago I downloaded some free Forth compiler, but hadn't
 time yet to look at it.

Very cool. That reminds me of the Lisp machines like Symbolics and the TI
Explorer. I take it these sorts of machines are very rare?

I'm told that GNU Forth is highly respected and I've got a copy kicking
around here waiting for me to find a good book and some spare time.

Forth started out as a stand-alone operating environment, because it
was written to run out of ROM on bare hardware. Later, Forth was adapted
to run out of RAM on systems that already had an operating system
installed.

I'm aware of this (see my comment about the _Jupiter Ace_), I was wondering
about an actual Forth operating system. That is, that there is an OS written
in Forth and that can be extended using Forth (much like the Lisp Operating
systems of the likes of Symbolics).

I'm not aware of any. (But then again, the last time I was involved in
using Forth was probably 1986.)

I liked Fifth myself. It claimed to be "One better than Forth", was
targeted at IBM PCs and clones running DOS, gave you a runtime
environment in which to work, and made saving and restoring programs
much easier than Forth did.

I use only Maxtor's. They work great.

I've had terrible luck with Quantums.

O harbour pode accessar normalmente arquivos dbf. voce pode usar odbc para
acesso a esses formatos , ou baixar as fontes de contribuicao de dar uma
olhada nos diretorios mysql e odbc.

Vou dar um olhada no seu site. Por outro lado, voce esta usando a htmllib
que esta disponivel no site do harbour

Atenciosamente

The Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 40 (ATA/100) series are a great value for the
money.  It is a quiet, *fast* drive, (7,200) rotational speed is a plus, the
drive handles Peer Networking, Video streaming, burning to CDR, etc. without
a problem.

(The DiamondMax Plus 20 (ATA/66) is also an excellent choice, if you find
one available.)

I hope the info. helps.

Bob

Luiz,

http://www.pricewatch.com/

Enter "DiamondMax Plus" (without quotes) in the [Enter Keywords] Search @
top of the page,

For the (40)gb model looks to be about ( $ 135.00 ) US dollars, www
discounted, not including shipping/handling.

For retail (store purchase) add $15-$20 dollars (US) to above amount
(typical retail markup), if you find it locally for less I would consider
that a good price.

Bob

Per http://www.neoseeker.com/Products/best_of.html?sid=3D64 the best hard

(out of 25) are occupied by four Quantum drives, a couple of Seagates, a
Western Digital, a Maxtor, and an IBM.

Subject: [HarbourTalk] Proper compatability is such a wonderful thing
Message-ID: <20010515190802.M7900@hagbard.davep.org>

I've just made a post to comp.lang.clipper regarding custom get readers and,
as part of the example code (see below), there was a simple use of the
Clipper pre-processor to provide a command that made for easy use of the
custom get reader. Exactly this sort of pre-processor trick totally defeated
the pre-preprocessor of a another Clipper clone that shall remain nameless
but suffice to say that it was Clipper 5.2 compatible and was capable of
producing GNU/Linux binaries.

Not only did this sort of code defeat its pre-processor but a long battle
with their tech support guys followed before I could get a reason out of
them as to why it wouldn't work ("our pre-processor isn't really compatible
with the one in CA-Clipper").

The test code in question is this:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
#include "inkey.ch"
#include "getexit.ch"

#xcommand @ <nRow>,<nCol> Get Read Only [<Stuff,...>] ;
          =>                                          ;
          @ <nRow>,<nCol> Get [<Stuff>]               ;
            Send reader := {|o| ReadOnlyReader( o ) }

Function Main()
Local GetList   := {}
Local cCanEdit1 := space( 20 )
Local cReadOnly := padr( "This is read-only", 20 )
Local cCanEdit2 := space( 20 )

   Cls

   @ 10, 10 Say "Can Edit 1:" Get cCanEdit1
   @ 11, 10 Say " Read Only:" Get Read Only cReadOnly
   @ 12, 10 Say "Can Edit 2:" Get cCanEdit2
   Read

Return( NIL )

Function ReadOnlyReader( oGet )
Local aMoveKeys := { K_UP, K_DOWN }
Local nKey

   If GetPreValidate( oGet )

      oGet:setFocus()

      Do While oGet:exitState == GE_NOEXIT

         If ascan( aMoveKeys, nKey := inkey( 0 ) ) != 0
            GetApplyKey( oGet, nKey )
         EndIf

      EndDo

      oGet:killFocus()

   EndIf

Return( NIL )
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

The point of this email? I did a quick compile with harbour and it built and
ran like a charm. No fuss, no hassle, it just worked. Had it failed I know I
could have posted the problem to the developer's mailing list and the bug
would have been looked at as a bug and not as an email from one of those
pesky users who always want the bloody thing to actually *work* ($DEITY
forbid that we should actually have to deliver on promises or expectations,
think of the state of the industry if that started happening).

Am I surprised that harbour "just worked"? No. I'm a chuffed that it "just
worked". You bet.

As a matter of interest, does anyone out there have Xbase++ to hand? How
does it cope with the above code?

No, I don't think it's bad news. I think it just means that Extended
Systems will continue to develop Advantage at the same pace as before
the merger talks, whereas if the merger conditions had remained
favorable and the merger had gone through, then I think that they would
have been able to develop at a more aggressive pace.

I has downloaded the last version, and it dont work.

Also i was giving an look on the wfbackup.ini  , and you are setting both
path and drive on.
Store pathnames in ZIP=Yes
Store WHOLE path in ZIP=Yes

If the whole path is set to true, it save both path and drive letter to the
zip file.
the store pathname in zip should only be enable , if the whole path is off

Also. and dumb question.
Why you distribute hbzlib.dll since you are linking the static
library(ziparchive.lib)
(ziparchive1.lib for use hbzlib.dll)

I know. In the source code, if "Store WHOLE path in ZIP" is set to YES, the
entry "Store path in ZIP" is automaticly set to FALSE.

This is line 329:
aTmp:=Directory(cFrom+"*.*","D"+If(lHiddenFiles,"H",""))

So the GPF occurs in the Directory() function.

I'd hazard a guess that he's looking for (in preferred order)

1: barcode algorithms.
2: barcode libraries
3: binary barcode utilities.

Dave, here is  my best. The translation of Babelfish is quite impresive but
it gets messed with some errors in the writing and the missing of accented
chars. (is it possible that your PC erased them?)

Friend programmer,
I am a Clipper's programmer and desire to receive information and
orientation.
I have an inventory system (or I should say stock system?) and I don't know
how to implement the handling of the bar-code printing.
Could you tell me where to find some example or library?
Or suggest some software?
I'll appreciate very much if you anwser me.

Thanks Phil, I'm happy to report that I'd guessed at something to do with
barcodes but knowing nothing at all about Spanish it could so easily have
been anything else.

My PC shouldn't and doesn't have a problem with accented characters as I'm
in the UK so I run everything ISO-8859-1. The original email didn't appear
to contain any accented characters and there's no charset or transfer
encoding information in there header.

Thanks to both of you for taking the time to translate.

Subject: [HarbourTalk] Free CA-Clipper ADS Local Server RDD?!!
In-Reply-To: <20010523072950.D21127@hagbard.davep.org>
Message-ID: <NCBBJKNMIDPJNLJCHCHIAEMJGDAA.harbour@winfakt.com>

Hi,

There is a interesting treat going on on the ADS newsgroup (
news://207.70.7.8/advantage.clipper )
Look for the "Subindex" subject and start at 01/05/22 (Messages from Greg
Chavelier)

It's about "ADS 6.0 for CA-Clipper". In this version it will be possible to
access databases with Local drive-letter. So actually we can do this in ADS:
USE "C:\TEST\TEST.DBF"

This means that in our app we can have ADS RDD as the *ONLY* ADS linked in.
Only downside is that the Server version of ADS needs to be installed on the
Local PC.

This is what I said to Brad Smidt:
> So, If other programming languages get such possibilities for *free*
> why should we, Clipper programmers, pay for it?
> Is it possible to make a ADS server this way that it only accepts ONE

Please go to the newsgroup and help us to get a "Free CA-Clipper ADS Local
Server RDD"!!

I'm not entirely sure if this counts, or even if it comes close to what we
were talking about, but I thought that the following post from the newsgroup
<URL:news:comp.os.linux.announce> was in some way apropos the above.

A copy of Borland's Kylix (Desktop Developer edition) has just turned up at
my house. Time for some fun and time to see how easily WEG will port to
GNU/Linux (blast! WEG will need a new name, unless I can think of something
else that the W can stand for <g>).

All of this is assuming that my GNU/Linux box is meaty enough to run Kylix.

So, anyone else out there playing with it? Thoughts?

I am sure it will help to increase the amount of apps

but I can't imagine how a non open-source development

I don't know enough about Linux yet to bother grabbing Kylix, but I've 
seen live demos at last year's Borcon, and it looked awesome. Particularly 
the fact that it was interoperable with Delphi 6 (since they both use 
CLX).

You ought to rename your app GrEG (graphical expert guide) :-)

While talking to Nick Ramsay on the phone this morning he came up with the
perfect name: XEG. When it's under X the X means X and when it's running
anywhere else the X means "anywhere".

That said, "Greg" has some appeal and it lends itself really well to being
turned into a recursive acronym.

That's not Antonio, that's me. That's the entry that the Harbour Talk

It's the second sense I'm using, although, here in the UK at least, Waffle

FiveWin seems to cope.

Besides, CLX is available under the GPL:

so, if FiveWin for Harbour (it being a non-Free application framework) fits
into an "Open Source stream of thinking" I'm sure Kylix and, more
importantly CLX, will fit in.

FWH is just for Windows.

using free Wine emulator (or translator).

So what is your point then? Kylix is the GNU/Linux targeting version of
Delphi, Delphi 6 is the Windows equivalent. Both systems use CLX. Either
development tool can be used to write free software or non-free software.
What difference does it matter if the underlying operating system kernel is
free software or not?

Non-free software exists for GNU/Linux, it has for quite some time. People
buy non-free software for GNU/Linux. The fact that I'm playing with Kylix
demonstrates that if nothing else.

So what do you mean when you say:

,----
| but I can't imagine how a non open-source development
| tool will fit into a open-source stream of thinking and

`----

What is it that you can't imagine? I thought you were having a hard time
imagining that people would write non-free software using free software
tools and environments (something you must be able to imagine because you're
company is doing that right now). Now it seems that you can't imagine that
people can write non-free software that runs on free software kernels, you
should be able to imagine that as it's been happening for ages.

What I mean is that it is hard for me to

the open source way.

Is the Kylix compiler and linker source code
included ?

Under the visual (and always pleasant way) layer,
there is a huge complexity that only Borland understands.

The last I knew there was a project like Wine but the other way round, it'd
let you run GNU/Linux compiled applications on Windows. I don't think it's
as far advanced as Wine though.

That's like saying that it's hard to understand how the harbour community is
going to accept FiveWin for Harbour when they "claim so string the open
source way". First you've got to justify your claims that there is a "Linux
community" that claims such at thing. Free software, as with anything
political, really isn't that simple or that black and white.

I'm part of the "Linux community" and have been since 1995, I see no problem
in accepting Kylix. I mean, I wouldn't have installed it to have a look at
it otherwise would I?

Anyway, I think you'll find that Kylix will be most popular with people
wanting to port their Delphi applications to Linux and one of the freedoms
you get is the freedom to run non-free software.

> Is the Kylix compiler and linker source code included ?

Not that I can see at the moment, I think it's the application framework
that is the thing that's under the GPL.

While this is most likely true, it's also true of the tools you use (or do
you have the source for all of Borland's C++ compiler?) and, presumably,
also true of some of the tools you yourself produce (or is all of the source
for every single part of FiveWin available for download and reading by
anyone who cares to take a look?).

Kylix, in total, isn't free software, there's no sense in expecting it to
behave like free software. Likewise, FiveWin isn't free software, there'd be
no sense in expecting it to behave like free software either.

BTW, how complex is this "complexity" you speak of? How do you know how
complex it is if you've never seen it?

Also, don't forget, there are free software Pascal compilers out there too.
There's even a free software Object Pascal compiler. No doubt people are
working right now to ensure that such compilers can make use of CLX.

Dave,

FW users provide around 70% of FW enhancements and bug fixes.

That means that FW source code is available to them and 
really easy to understand.

I am very familiar to Delphi. Under its visual layer (so friendly)
there is a scaring complexity that only a very few guys
do understand.

In fact, I have never seen a VCL bug fixed by a Delphi user.
And there have been bugs around, as on all software products.

All the source code, or only some of the source code?

Remember, your confusion about Kylix is that it isn't open source but I've
shown to you that the heart of it (CLX) isn't just open source, it's free
software in the FSF sense of the term. The last time I looked FiveWin didn't
even ship with an open source licence, let alone a free software licence.
Despite this I've seen very few people get confused about how FiveWin for
Harbour might survive.

IOW, Kylix is much more free than FiveWin for Harbour (for example) so if
you can imagine that FiveWin for harbour (a non-OpenSource product) can work
in an open source world then you should have no problems imagining that
Kylix can exist there too.

Obviously, the question about people wanting to use it at all is a different
and, arguably, much more interesting.

I'm very familiar with Delphi too but I've never seen the source code for
the compiler. Where is this complexity that people can't see that bothers
you?

Hmm, I've seen VCL bug fixes, by users, discussed before.

Excited would be taking it a little too far, I've been discussing the issue
of freedom here, not talking up Delphi.

I'm much more excited by the new _Manic Street Preachers_ CD that I'm
listening to today.

That's welcome news. I knew that there was going to be some "'free as in
beer' as long as you're writing 'free as in freedom' software with it"
version but I didn't know that they were thinking of making the compiler
open source or free in some way.

I wonder if the same will be done with a version of Delphi 6?

I just had a go at building WEG with Kylix. It took around 3/4 hour of
source modifications, mostly sprinkling the source with {$IFDEF WINDOWS} to
remove the Windows specific stuff (Registry, Windows D&D, DDE, etc...),
before I had something that looked like WEG running on my GNU/Linux box.

I wouldn't want to release it into the wild in this state and I think I
really need a copy of Delphi 6 before I could think of having a supportable
dual-platform set of sources but I'm impressed at how quickly I managed to
move it over.

I'd estimate a couple of days of hacking with a copy of Delphi 6 and Kylix
to get a working set of dual-platform sources. It looks like the VCL and CLX
have a number of significant (and understandable) differences that need to
be dealt with. Also, as I say above, some parts of WEG rely on Windows
specific stuff, that'd have to be properly dealt with too.

Still, a couple of days to port something like WEG to GNU/Linux isn't too
shabby.
