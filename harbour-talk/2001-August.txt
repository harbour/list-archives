Hi,
I know that this is not harbour related but I wnted to
ask some advices from the linux guys:

Which are the antivirus most suitable for a Linux box
acting as a gateway to Internet (via ADSL) and running
a mail server.

It should provide antivirus protection for the mail
exchange and (if possible) for the web traffic.

I'll appreciate any comments.

regards
Horacio

I use postfix as the SMTP server and http://www.kaspersky.com as the
antivirus to check the mail on the servers I configure.  The combination has
been working great for us.

Wow! Glad to hear you're all ok Chen. It seemed "close to home" when one of
the London bombs early this year went off round the corner from a friend's
flat. This is even closer.

I'm still totally bemused by this spiral of violence. It seems to me that it
in no way serves the purposes of ordinary people while, at the same time,
the "opinion" of "ordinary people" demand that the violence continue. Sad,
very sad.

Political, economic or religious differences do not give reason for
violence alone. Think of the many examples where people have lived (and
live) together in peace although there have been (and are) such
differences between them. Violence exists when one group does not
respect and tolerate the other or feels superior to them. And if people
would stop hating people because of things that happened hundreds of
years ago. Doesn't lead to nowhere. Live and let live, despite all
differences.

Like it or not, it is part of our gens.

Violence does not only express itself as physical damage.
There are so many kinds of psichological violence and
abuse.

Instead of closing our eyes and dreaming about a non
real world, it is much better to be aware to recognize
it in so many different ways...

Agreed, but as long as such differences exist (and I hope they always do)
they give violent people "justification" for their antisocial behaviour.
Sadly such differences also give the state reasons to misuse "public
opinion" and commit acts of violence for the "common good" too. One man's
terrorist is another man's hero and all that...

More often than not it seems to me that it's never "one group" but is,
instead, a subset of dishonest, intolerant idiots within both groups. You
suggest that I think of the "many examples" where people with differences
live in peace but, I must admit, I'm having a hard time of thinking of such
examples because there always seems to be a tiny minority of people who want
to blame someone else for their own problems.

That'd put the arms industry out of business, not to mention the fact that
most forms of media would have nothing to report. On top of that it would
mean that most states would have nothing to use to control the thinking of
their populations. "They" can't allow that.

Cynical? Moi?

There is much evidence at the moment that most part of our personality
as a human being is NOT determined by our genes but by "education". If
you learn that it is okay to kill people to get to your aim, you might
do that. Or if you learn that you get to paradise if you kill
non-believers of your religion...This is not determined by the genes.

I am not closing my eyes nor am I dreaming...a world without violence
will never exist, this is clear. But in the situation here, we are not
talking about isolated violence (rape and so on) committed by
individuals, but about planned violence committed by a group, i.e. a war
situation. This is different. And I don't accept wars being an integral
part of my life.

I believe it's an unavoidable side-effect of life in general, not just human
life. At the macro level anyway. While many of us might strive to live a
violence free life that only operates at the micro level.

The irony, of course, is that the only way to stop general violence and
disorder is the threat of violence. We generally call that approach to
violence "the rule of law".

Martin,

> And I don't accept wars being an integral part of my life.

Our inmunological system it is all based on war.
Our body fights viruses constantly. On a higher level,
inteligence means adaptation, and adaptation -again- requires
to fight.

Universe life is based on the depredators piramid. Life is
based on the death. That is a fact.

I am not saying I am in favor or against this. I am just
saying it is a scientifically proved fact.

Yup, and the most important thing is to keep this group as small as
possible. I agree that they will alwys exist but they simply must not
take over leadership.

Yes, but don't let this minority control the thoughts of the majority.
And to give some examples: Catholics and Protestants here in Germany
(not to be taken for granted looking at history), German and French
people (not too long ago, the French were the Germans' "inherited
enemies"), rich and poor people in many countries (as long as the poor
get the at least the chance to get some prosperity, of course)...

Not to detract from your main point but I seriously doubt that there's
scientific proof that this is the basis of all life in the universe (all
*known* life, yes, not speaking of all life in the universe is something
different).

[Thread drift, but this is harbour-talk after all] Of course, the desire to
keep "this group as small as possible" is one of the methods employed by the
state to control the population as a whole. Once you've scared the
population with the threat of what such small groups can do the population
will then allow all sorts of invasive measures to be employed. Privacy then
suffers.

Also, the methods employed to stop the "violent minority" are themselves
forms of violence. Or, if they're not forms of violence they employ the
threat of violence. As I said in another email, that threat of violence is
generally known as "the rule of law". AKA "Do as the 'majority' says or
suffer the consequences".

Unfortunately this generally means that the majority has to either control
the thoughts of the majority and/or the minority. Perhaps they'll even seek
to eradicate the minority? Again, that either requires violence or the
threat of violence. Either way, violence exists.

I do honestly wonder if these examples you give really are examples. Can you
say with certainty that in those example communities that nobody harbour's
thoughts of violence against members of the other group? Sure, I know you
can't, but my point here is that, for some within those groups, I'd be
willing that it's the threat of violence that stops the violence from
happening.

Sadly it's also a description of how states generally work.

There's a book everyone should read. We read it at school (which would
probably have unnerved Orwell <g>) and I've read it a couple of times since.

I've been mulling all of this over this afternoon and I guess this is all
part of the "it's for the good of the children" problem. Find a reason that
no "good" person could argue against and milk it for all it's worth.

point is in the CHOICE
there is no choice in relation between lion/antillope, virus/antivirus
(they are all hardcoded)

A very good book, indeed. We have read it at school, too. And now
looking at what comes to daylight about how the "Stasi" worked in
Eastern Germany - you can see some analogies. The psychological methods
they used to "break" the "enemies of the republic" (taking them to
prison, let them go but prevent that they get a job, take them to prison
again and so on...), how they perverted the facts in their newspaper
articles and how they even lied while drawing maps (the "official" east
german map of Berlin showed no single building and two roads only for
the western part, West-Berlin should look like a field and forest
territory)...

Reading this makes me shiver. Really! They are installing cameras at
many bus stops here, too, and I am not feeling very glad about that. But
I'm afraid many people are willing to give up a big part of their
freedom just for a feeling of "security" since,  like you said, no
"good" person can be against preventing crimes.

Agreed.  Another amazing example:

Around 15 years ago (!) a local[0] lieutenant organized a police operation
to protect the business of a known cocaine dealer.  The plan was that
the police would save up a share of the profits in a special fund that
would be used to make a spectacular "buy" in Florida[1] in order to get
evidence to arrest and convict a major supplier.  The project "succeeded."
The lieutenant was praised by the mayor[2] for "innovative police work"
and soon promoted to Chief.

When the details of this plan were revealed by an investigative reporter,
the four police officers who could be shown to have had something to do
with the plan were tried on charges of, um, something like conspiring
to sell illegal drugs.

They were all acquitted without having to present a defense because, as
the judge ruled, that even if all the accusations were true, what they
did would not have been considered illegal anyway.

The reaction of most media and political types to this scandal amounted
to the old saying, "If you want an omelette, you have to break some eggs."

So in .us, ANYTHING is okay if it's supposed to be against selling drugs.
Even if it's... selling drugs.  Surely no good person could be against
that if the intention is right?


[0] .cleveland.oh.us
[1] southeastern .us state, often considered a primary importation point
    for illegal substances
[2] now US Senator George Voinovich, don't you feel better now?

 There is a lot of analogies in modern world, too.
 I thought about Orwell's 'Ministry of Peace' and 'Ministry of Truth'
 every time when I heard speeches of some Nato officials, especially
 while last Yugoslavia's company. ( I could give many examples from
 Russian inner politic, too, but they aren't known enough aboard ).
 But Orwell's novel is much more deep than simple analogies ...
 Just my 2 cents :).

Funny you should mention that, I was watching a documentary on TV (here in
the UK) last night about how states keep tabs on their populations. In
particular they were looking at the "cold war" era and how the US, UK and
DDR did things. As you might imagine the Stasi got a good mention.

There was a fascinating statistic that said that one person in two hundred
was involved in keep tabs on the rest of the population.

You and me both. CCTV is big business here in the UK now and we're
constantly told how it's for our own good and how "no honest person could
possibly have anything to worry about". Next it'll be ID cards (already
partly there with the new format of the driving licence).

Well put, that's an excellent comparison IMO.

During one of the bombing campaigns in the former Yugoslavia (sorry, I'm
awful at remembering the details), on the first night of a heavy bombing
campaign, I can remember sitting there flicking thru the news channels on
Sky[1] and being horrified at how all the reports were praising the
precision of the bombing and how "clean" the whole thing was. Plenty of
presenters could give me all sorts of information about the yield of the
weapon and how the target was justified and the like, nobody seemed to be
reporting in a neutral sense.

I was very heartened when, on the BBC news IIRC, there was a "round table"
discussion involving Tony Benn[2]. I forget who else was in the discussion
but I do recall that there was some young military "expert" getting all
excited about the pictures and some equally young presenter egging him on.

Benn exploded into an amazing rant, pointing out to them that *real* people
with *real* lives were on the receiving end of that action. He pointed out
that nobody seemed to be questioning the morality of the action, let alone
the legality of it. Having been called on their thoughtless praise of the
spectacle of the bombing they all seemed lost for anything useful to say.

I was really heartened by that. Sadly, the following day, most people I
spoke to didn't see it and those that did thought that Benn was missing the
point because "of course" the action was justified.

I've got a lot of time for Tony Benn.

Agreed, there's a lot more than just analogies, but the analogies are useful
in themselves. _Animal Farm_ is enjoyable from this POV too.

I seem to recall it was more like one in twenty.

Either way, the number is shocking.

<http://www.stasiopfer.de/mfsbig.html> (german site, sorry) states that
in 1989 there have been 85,500 official and 174,200 "unofficial", i.e.
inner spies, employed by the Stasi. For a population of 16 millions,
that would be 1 in 60. The total number is larger, since many IM
(inoffizielle Mitarbeiter - "unofficial co-workers") have only worked
some years for the Stasi (as long as they could deliver interesting
information), so that there have been many fluctuations.

So one in two hundred would be about right for official Stasi employees and
it's closer to Mark's figure if we include unofficial workers and informants
and the like?

Fascinating, and almost unbelievable, stuff.

Still, I've never actually looked at how many people work for and with the
security service in the UK.

You see, Dave, again you are pushing people

That is the reason why your legal and picky style

I've dealt with your other points in private email as there's little point
in muddying the harbour lists any more with rebuttals of your insults.
However, I did want to say, in response to the above, that I fully and
totally agree with this, hence the reason that I express myself and hence
the reason I show an active interest in what other people have to say.

Hi,

I am looking for a way how to do something like this :

SomeClassName:SomeClassMethod()

where SomeClassName is a class name, not an object name.

In C++ I can do (not very interesting example):

class SomeClassA {
    friend class SomeClassB;

public:
    int MethodA() { return SomeClassB::MethodB() };
}

class SomeClassB : public SomeClassB {
    static int SomeVar;
protected:
    static int MethodB() {return SomeVar};
}

How could it be simulated in Harbour ?

Also could someone give me a short example of a working code which
uses CLASSMETHOD <MethodName> clause ? I don't know the exact syntax.

Many thanks in advance.

Why have you sent a reply to a private email to a public mailing list? Why
are you trying to keep your little campaign on the harbour lists?

Perhaps I'm missing something here but you seem to be asking how to have
class variables and class methods in harbour (see below) but the important
part of your example seems to revolve around the idea of friend classes. Is
the idea of friend class supposed to be important in the above?

> Also could someone give me a short example of a working code which uses

Here's a quick and dirty example that simply works with class variables:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
#include "hbclass.ch"

Class NothingSpecial

   Exported:

      ClassVar nCount Init 0

      Method init

End Class

/////

Method init Class NothingSpecial

   ::nCount++

Return( self )

/////

Function Main()
Local n

   For n := 1 to 10

      // Create, and throw away, an instance of NothingSpecial.
      NothingSpecial():new()

      // Print the instance count class variable
      ? NothingSpecial():nCount

   Next

Return( NIL )
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

However, in playing with the above I can't get class methods to work how I'd
expect either. I suspect there might be a compiler bug lurking around here
some place.

I was expecting something like this:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
#include "hbclass.ch"

Class NothingSpecial

   Exported:

      ClassVar nCount Init 0

      Method init

      Class Method sayInstanceCount

End Class

/////

Method init Class NothingSpecial

   ::nCount++

Return( self )

/////

Method sayInstanceCount Class NothingSpecial

   ? "We've had " + alltrim( str( ::nCount ) ) + " instances."

Return( self )

/////

Function Main()
Local n

   For n := 1 to 10

      // Create, and throw away, an instance of NothingSpecial.
      NothingSpecial():new()

      // Print the instance count class variable
      ? NothingSpecial():nCount

   Next

Return( NIL )
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

to work but that won't compile:

,----
| foo.prg(25) Error E0010 'Method "sayInstanceCount" not declared in class:
|                          NothingSpecial '
`----

Either I've got the above syntax wrong or the compiler has a problem with
class methods.

I'll CC this to the developer's list for their comments.

Marek, the word has come back from the developer who looks after the class
system side of harbour: class methods aren't fully working yet. They are on
his "TODO list".

No, It is not important here at all. The example was simply based on a code
from one of a GNU C++ library, and my question was about class methods.

I was asking rather about class methods, not class vars.

The same for me. This is why I asked.

OK.

Many THANKS for Your help.

Hi,
 sorry for using the list for announcements, but this is only for the
 first release.
 I just uploaded HWGUI library to my web site, it is released under
 the same license, as Harbour. The package includes sources, short
 description, samples. Makefiles included are for BC.

Best regards,

There's no harm in announcing harbour related free software on the harbour
mailing lists. You might actually want to drop a note into the developer's
mailing list too in case there are any developers who don't take this list.

I guess it's referring to the fact that often DOS applications are regarded
as "legacy" applications (ie ones which are kept for historical or
practical reasons, but are really outdated).

Of course, many of us are still using DOS apps out of necessity (hardware
which won't run anything better, for example) so we can't treat them as
"legacy" apps.

The idea of "internet enabling" a "legacy" system seems to suggest that
it's not the fact that it's running on DOS that makes it outmoded, rather
the fact that it's not running in a browser or some-such. A strange
philosophy, to be sure.

Let me guess, you've been mailed with an advert for a job in Holland.

Why do you think Alexander has been mailed with an advert for a job in Holl=
and? Did you get such an e-mail?

I am from Holland and I know that it is hard to get a permit to work in The=
 Netherlands for non-EU residents. That's why I ask!

Yup. By coincidence I also got an email from a job agency in the UK asking
if I'd be interested in relocation to .nl for a job there. I suspect they're
one in the same.

Presumably many people with a Clipper background and visibility on the web
and/or usenet got a copy of the email.

I'm an EU resident so that wouldn't be a problem for me.

Curiously the email from the UK agency (I'm putting two and two together and
guessing that it's for the same position(s)) said:

,----
| We will look after the relocation and the work permits (for non EU
| citizens).
`----

so perhaps they too are mailing outside of the EU.

Dave,

Clipper programmers are hard to get these days in The Netherlands and I thi=
nk it's the same for most countries in Western Europe. Most of them are ofc=
ourse switched to a Windows development environment.=20

I don't know about the situation in the former Soviet countries. I think th=
e money is better here, so that could attract some people from these countr=
ies.

Do you know the name of the company in The Netherlands that is looking for =
Clipper programmers?

Jan-Dirk

I'm not sure if the details I've got are for the company in question or for
an agency. Would you like me to pass your details onto the agency that
contacted me?
