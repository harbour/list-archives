Subject: [Harbour-users] compiling apps on linux (fedora) - linker
Message-ID: <484C9293.4010404@duplication.ca>

Hi,

I have installed harbour RC1 on a Fedora 6 system. I compiled harbour OK. Now I am trying 
to compile some programs.

For example I go to contrib/examples/misc. There is a Makefile but I have no idea how to 
run any make utility on it. Is there some way to use these Makefiles?

So I run:

  hbmake -ex guess.gc

hbmake runs and I have the object files but there is no executable file anywhere.  I guess 
the linker is not being called. So what is the next step to run the linker?

Thanks
George

I do not find any of these utilities like hblnk in my harbour RC1 installation.  Am I 
supposed to find them? Maybe I installed the wrong way? All I did to install was run 
make_gcc.sh.

I am able to run simple programs by hbrun. And I can run simple programs using the 
#!/usr/bin/hbrun as the first line of the prg.

I found an old version of hb-build (hblnk) in my backups and installed it but nothing 
happens when I run it.

Main question is: Am I supposed to find hb-build/hblnk in the current RC1, or is there a 
new way to build using the config files?

Thanks

George

George,

1st of all, get ALL RPMs from my web site.

adasiek@abix-acer:~/RPM/RPMS/i586> ll
razem 4324
-rw-r--r-- 1 adasiek users 1470409 VI  5 19:08 harbour-1.0.0-RC1.i586.rpm
-rw-r--r-- 1 adasiek users  431895 VI  5 19:08
harbour-contrib-1.0.0-RC1.i586.rpm
-rw-r--r-- 1 adasiek users 1221749 VI  5 19:08 harbour-lib-1.0.0-RC1.i586.rpm
-rw-r--r-- 1 adasiek users 1264414 VI  5 19:08 harbour-static-1.0.0-RC1.i586.rpm



Then, install them as user root using rpm -ivh * command.
Then, you should have in /usr/bin :
adasiek@abix-acer:/usr/bin> ll hb*
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  13012 VI  5 19:08 hb-build
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      8 VI  5 20:15 hbcc -> hb-build
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      8 VI  5 20:15 hbcmp -> hb-build
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 161284 IX  1  2007 hbdoc
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 121344 VI  5 19:08 hbdot
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      8 VI  5 20:15 hblnk -> hb-build
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 156708 VI  5 19:08 hbmake
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      8 VI  5 20:15 hbmk -> hb-build
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4077 VI  5 19:08 hb-mkslib
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 106863 VI  5 19:08 hbpp
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 116848 VI  5 19:08 hbrun
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 318680 IX  1  2007 hbtest
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  14506 IX  1  2007 hbverfix

These scripts are in harbour-1.0.0-RC1.i586.rpm.
Thats all.

Best regards

Hi Adam,

Thanks for the tip to use rpm. I wanted to try to compile it myself and finally succeeded. 
For users who may be interested, here is how I was able to compile from source.

Trying make_rpm.sh I had an error about "invalid option -ta". I found a bunch of rpm 
development tools that had to be upgraded or installed.

Also at some point I had an error about invalid character "-" so I removed it in 
harbour.spec line 0.9.9-RC1...

Then make fails at hbmake. Needs some X11 libs. Installed libX11...

I found I had old harbour rpms installed so I had to find and delete them:

rpm -qa | grep harbour
rpm -e harbour.....

Then from /usr/source/redhat/RPMS/i386 it works: rpm -ivh *

And now I can compile and link simple programs using hbmk.

So I go on to a more complex example like contrib/examples/pe and it doesn't work. 
editorlo.c is not compiling. No big deal, I just go on to my own needs.

Now I can compile and link a CGI program I wrote for my online store shipping calculator. 
Now I get shipping rates in milliseconds instead of waiting for many seconds for UPS or 
canadapost servers to answer.

Thanks to the harbour developers for working on this great harbour compiler.

George

there is a file xhbgtmk.sh for it (I can send it to you via Skype
skype://abix_adamj ). This is a script for getting SVN branch devel
and make all RPMs neccesary for your distro.
Please check the svn, ncurses-devel, slang, slang-devel are installed
on your Fedora .. or make split to openSUSE ;-)

Yes, rpm has a bug, and thats all. But for me in openSUSE everything works well.

In last SVN Rev. ID 8637 I have it is corrected to :
%define name     harbour
%define dname    Harbour
%define version  1.0.0
%define releasen RC1
%define hb_pref  hb

And probably you will need some more ....

Subject: [Harbour-users] French Collation error 
Message-ID: <2A388B83CAF14C27A6A9C1CC3FE6D803@BadouPortable>

Hello Harbour Developers,

I use since yesterday the last upgrade of FWH.
Compile with Harbour and Borland.

In the french language, we have many
possibles signs on letters : a "e" can also be "?",
or "?", or "?", or others... This is not simple
to learn French because this (and not only).

The french collation provided by C.A. Nantucket Clipper
is useful for the Clipper function named UPPER().

With Clipper :
UPPER("?") = "E"
UPPER("?") = "A"

This work perfectly with Fivewin for Clipper,
because UPPER() is a Clipper function.

But this not work with Harbour.
Is existing a way to correct this ?
I not use ADS for the moment in my tests.

Note : with these command lines, there is no change :

REQUEST HB_LANG_FR
REQUEST HB_CODEPAGE_FR

HB_LangSelect("FR")
HB_SetCodePage("FR")
SET(_SET_LANGUAGE, "FR")

Thank for your help.
