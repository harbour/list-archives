Hi!
In the Hwgui a programers add this new function, but no compatible with
Harbour.
Can anybody add this function into xhb.lib ?

TIA,
Itamar M. Lins Jr.


FUNCTION WAITRUN( cRun )
Local hIn, hOut, nRet, hProc
   // "Launching process", cProc
   hProc := HB_OpenProcess( cRun , @hIn, @hOut, @hOut )

   // "Reading output"
   // "Waiting for process termination"
   nRet := HB_ProcessValue( hProc )

   FClose( hProc )
   FClose( hIn )
   FClose( hOut )

   Return nRet

// This example implements a parent process launching a child process
// (it is shown in the next example).

   PROCEDURE Main()
      LOCAL cData  := "Hello World"
      LOCAL cEXE   := "ChildProc.exe"
      LOCAL nBytes, nChild, nError, nStdIN, nStdOUT, nStdERR

      CLS
      ? "Opening child process:", cEXE

      nChild := HB_OpenProcess( cEXE, @nStdIN, @nStdOUT, @nStdERR )

      IF nChild < 0
         ? "Error:", FError()
         QUIT
      ENDIF

      ? "Sending data         :", FWrite( nStdIN, cData )

      ? "Receiving data       : "
      cData := Space( 1000 )
      nBytes := Fread( nStdOUT, @cData, Len(cData) )
      ?? Left( cData, nBytes )

      ? "Reading errors       : "
      cData := Space( 1000 )
      nBytes := Fread( nStdERR, @cData, Len(cData) )
      ?? Left( cData, nBytes )

      ? "Waiting for end      :", HB_ProcessValue( nChild )

      FClose( nChild )
      FClose( nStdIN )
      FClose( nStdOUT )
      FClose( nStdERR )

Now is created an harbour group on facebook
http://www.facebook.com/groups/edit.php?customize&gid=48795263775#/group.php?gid=48795263775

This is a usergroup for people who apreciate Harbour & Clipper
Harbour is a modern, fast, open source, computer programming language.
It is a Clipper-compatible compiler which is cross-platform

I invite everybody post as photo screenshot of application made with
harbour!
Post library used and little description of application
So we have a big collection of this works

Well, this seemed like a good excuse to expand my knowledge.  I hadn't 
tried to do anything more adventurous to a FreeBSD port then adding a 
patch, etc.  After some tinkering I now have a Harbour 1.0.1 FreeBSD port 
that's working well enough for my needs.  With a little more polishing I 
might even be brave enough to try submitting it to FreeBSD.  :-)

Whoever created the 0.44.0 port added an additional Makefile and script. 
The port's Makefile executed the added Makefile, which in turn called the 
added script.  That script set several Harbour environment variables to 
control the build, changed to the source dir, and finally executed 
Harbour's Makefile, via gmake.  I've stripped out the unneeded layers of 
confusion and set all the environment variables in the port's Makefile.

So, anyway, I have a few questions to aid in the polishing.  Has the 
Harbour development team ever considered using a ./configure script 
instead of various environment variables?  It would greatly simplify 
creating Harbour packages on source based, and a few binary based, Linux 
distros, not to mention FreeBSD, etc.  Most distros with automated build 
systems prefer building via:

    ./configure -> make -> make install

Where can I find documentation on all the environment variables available 
to control building Harbour?  I found some in make_gcc.mak but it doesn't 
appear to be a complete list.  HB_WITHOUT_X11, for example, isn't 
documented there.

The various *.txt files under doc and the Makefiles under doc appear to be 
out of sync.  Some docs get omitted if I set HB_DOC_INSTALL.  Is there an
environment variable to enable installing the man pages?  I don't even see 
a Makefile in doc/man.  For the moment I'm just installing the docs and 
man pages via the port's Makefile.

Subject: [Harbour-users] OutStd() Pipe Question
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0812051845250.29569@Blaidd-Drwg.RawFedDogs.net>

Clipper Fans,

Is there any special compile/link flags one needs to use or 
commands/functions one needs to call within a program who's output is 
intended to be piped to another program?  I'm experiencing some odd 
behavior trying to pipe program output to less, grep, etc.  For example, 
with the following program:

Function Main()

Local i

For i = 1 to 500
     OutStd("Line:  ", str(i), HB_OSNewLine()) 
Next

Return

If I compile/link with hbcmp/hblnk then run the program on a Gentoo Linux 
box and pipe it's output to less, it displays one screen full of the 
output and less exits.  With my current rxvt-unicode font settings it's 
displaying the first 35 lines of output.  On FreeBSD it displays the same 
number of lines, but with a stair-step effect.  I also tried the same 
program on the Gentoo box on a virtual console.  It also displayed one 
screen full of output, in that case through line 24, then less exited. 
With other programs I'm seeing similar strangeness such as only displaying 
half a screen worth of the output in some cases.  In other cases the 
output looks normal and less works correctly until I page all the way down 
to the last line of output then less stops interpreting the cursor 
movement keys correctly.



P.S.  Is there a problem with this mailing list's settings?  All messages 
from the list have Harbour-Users@Harbour-Project.org in their From header 
instead of the original poster's address.
