Subject: [Harbour-users] Set Exclusive on CIFS mounted files
Message-ID: <4B8E33F2.1010408@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Has anyone tried to exclusive-use on CIFS mounted files with Harbour? I 
have a CIFS mount point:
mount -t cifs -o 
rw,sync,user=ptiuser,password=secret,uid=1000,gid=1000,noperms,directio 
//192.168.20.1/ptiuser/dbf /mnt/dbf

As a test, I run on computer A a foxpro (under dosemu) script that use a 
dbf as exclusive. Then on my computer I write a harbour app that use the 
same file exclusively. The result is both computer can use the file in 
the same time!

The second test, on my computer I use the file exclusively under foxpro 
(on dosemu). And the set exclusive command takes effect, the file is 
used exclusively.

Is it a bug on harbour, or I'm passing the wrong mount parameters?

Regards,
Agustianes U. S.

Your problem has nothing to CIFS volumes.

In POSIX systems like Linux DOS DENY flags (EXCLUSIVE mode) do not exist.
DOSEMU emulates them only and such emulation is visible and respected only
by programs executed in DOSEMU. The exception is when inside DOSEMU you
are running network client which connects to file server directly instead
of using LREDIR volumes. In such case DOSEMU sends information about the
DOS DENY flags to file server which can manage them and synchronize other
clients.

It's not a bug. Read above. You are simply making sth what cannot work
with programs executed outside DOSEMU.

Hi Przemek,

Thank you for your reply. So, is there any way I can make set exclusive 
work under Linux?

That's an infinite loop without iddle states
How do you expect the app to respond to anything ?

I have tons of code with thats loops !
I will like something as thread that only refresh event loop ?

Tengo mucho codigo con esos bucles y no me gustaria tener que repasarlos
todos !
Me gustaria que existiese algo como un thread (startthread) que refrescara

You are exposing a common problem with Clipper programming.

There is no way to refresh the GT unless Przemek introduces

passive threads doing this job.

 

Until then, call inkey() in the loop.

I cannot do that.
In the moment when you added HB_GTI_NOTIFIERBLOCK you effectively
blocked the possibilities of serving window loop by non HVM thread
so first this feature has to be removed

I did not know that at all. And probably I do not know much about GT internals.

 

Can you kindly update me how a passive thread will work and why 

HB_GTI_NOTIFIERBLOCK is a show-stopper to achieve this?

 

May be we get a solution for both.

HB_GTI_NOTIFIERBLOCK introduces PRG code executed from window
message loop. It means that we cannot create non HVM thread
to create windows and process this window messages because such
thread cannot activate PRG code.

We can quite easy create non HVM thread inside GTWVT which will
create windows and process all it's messages taking data to display
for GT buffers and putting input events to keyboard/mouse queue.
We will need only simply mutex to synchronize access to GT structure.
Such worker threads resolves also possible deadlocks which can appear
in MT MS-Win GUI applications what should greatly helps users which
are not very familiar with concurrent programing and MS-Windows API
restrictions.
But the problem appears when we have HB_GTI_NOTIFIERBLOCK because
non HVM thread cannot execute PRG code. In MT mode we can create
separate HVM thread to execute it but it will work in different way
then current code so it will be necessary to define new conditions
how such feature should work of course it will not work in ST
applications.

Przemek

What do you mean by "freezes"? A console application is started up in
a separated thread and doesn't affect on other applications.

Mariusz,

During skipping records loops, in skipping records loops, the console window
refresh, at least it can paint self.
In windows (GTWVWG) window, during the same loops, the window not refresh
and the image is broken.

Sorry my poor english

I think was the same running aspect than GTWvw (xHarbour)

And I test GTWvg and:
-Not frozen main window
-Not says "this application dont´t answer" (Windows Spanish)...

GTWvg really it's BIG ok (thank you for his developments)

Do your Indexing with a "while" condition, which is tied to a dialog and
button.

Initial lClicked := .f. 
If the button is clicked, action will set a static variable to lClicked :=
.t.

On the index command, use the while condition to see if lClicked is still
false, or set to .t. - at which point you can confirm the cancel request.

Hi all,

After yesterday's cvs I created harbour for MSVC 2008 (32bits).

Then I tried to create harbour libs for msvc 2008 ce but I have these

(and more)

These are the sets I use:

SET HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=e:\programacion_ant\hb_msvcce
SET HB_CONTRIBLIBS=no
SET HB_CONTRIB_ADDONS=no
SET HB_EXTERNALLIBS=no


and then

win-make clean install

Can some one give some guidelines of how to solve this problem?

Many thanks,

Subject: [Harbour-users] GUI programming.
Message-ID: <4B9D2E06.7020208@gmail.com>

Hello, i'm looking for some advice now.

I'm an old fashion clipper programmer but now i need to make a graphical 
user interfase program.
I have no experience on OOP, but i know i have to learn and that's out 
off discussion but i would like to avoid entering that way for now since 
i'm in kind of a hurry.

I'm looking for the easiest way to make a GUI program, but i don't know 
where to start looking.

I have seen in the past a library that converted a console program to 
GUI only by adding some lines to the code but i don't remember the name 
of that tool.
This would be i guess the ideal way so i can keep making my old 
"clipper" programs and convert the already done ones.

Well i hope some answers to start moving, thanks in advance people.

Richard,
If you are looking for free software I think HMG system is good
choice. Start at http://sites.google.com/site/harbourminigui

Probably you are talking about GTWVG.

Yes, this is the fastest and easiest way to port Clipper code with 

minimal of changes. But again, it is not a pure GUI, though you can 

present your existing applications with a GUI look and feel.

For pure GUI approach, you will need to learn a lot, a steap 

learning curve.

Well, first you must be sure of your long-term goals:

   1. You want only one platform,

   2. Your application be able to different OS's with the same look and feel.

 

If you opt for #1, and you are contended with Windows only, then you have 

many options, listed below without any particular order ( I do not use either of them ):

   VXH

   Xailer

   FIVEWIN

   HMG ( though not a pure OOP code )

   HWGUI 

Some of above may be portable to other OS, not sure.

 

If you opt for #2, then 

   you are encouraged to look into hbQT, hbXBP libraries. A first hand application 

   is also there to help you understand the approach and the way you can take use of 

   the libraries, hbIDE ( Harbour's Integrated Development Environment ).

Subject: [Harbour-users] GUI programming.

Hello, i'm looking for some advice now.

I'm an old fashion clipper programmer but now i need to make a graphical 
user interfase program.
I have no experience on OOP, but i know i have to learn and that's out 
off discussion but i would like to avoid entering that way for now since 
i'm in kind of a hurry.

I'm looking for the easiest way to make a GUI program, but i don't know 
where to start looking.

I have seen in the past a library that converted a console program to 
GUI only by adding some lines to the code but i don't remember the name 
of that tool.
This would be i guess the ideal way so i can keep making my old 
"clipper" programs and convert the already done ones.

Well i hope some answers to start moving, thanks in advance people.

Now, is it bad or good? (to not be pure OOP).
I 'd say it's good, especially for an old fashion clipper programmer 
like the OP (as he has declared himself) and like me.

In my opinion, HMG (both, official:http://www.hmgforum.com/site and 
extended: http://hmgextended.com/files/CONTRIB/hmg-1.8-81-setup.zip 
releases) is the most clipper-programmer friendly GUI and perhaps the 
most successful of all. They're in a good, I'd say mature level with 
active user bases and very helpful support by developers. The only (and 
i must admit major), drawback is that it is a windows only oriented 
solution.

A very good and clean choice is also HwGUI but unfortunately the 
development of this project seems to be stalled.

The others (VXH, Xailer, FiveWin) AFAIK are closed code commercial 
products and thus not so close to the Harbour's spirit and tradition.
But that's a matter of choice, of course.

Hi Paola,
Yes, I am aware of ooHG. Interesting project and good product also.
But to be honest I am not an eager supporter of the OOP model. Actually 
I keep many doubts about object programming paradigm, since I don't 
believe is better than other models like procedural programming for 
example. I know, OOP is established as main stream programming style but 
I don't think that they're proved all the benefits that it is supposed 
that it has.

This is true, but not fully true :)

Think on Visual Basic.

It become the most popular programming language in the world in 90's, 
but it do not allowed class creation until version 4.0.

Besides that, most of the programs created with VB that I've seen, do 
not use classes.

Users simply create forms with the designer and refers to the objects 
visually created, in a simple, straight (non-true OOP) way (ie: 
form1.button1.SetFocus).

This behavior is consistent with xBase spirit.

dBase III+ and its succesors had simplified the things for the users.

Sadly, sometime in the way to evolution, Clipper suffered the influence 
of some products 'in fashion' by the end of 80's (SmallTalk, C++, 
Pascal, etc.) and become more complicated and low level that in previous 
versions.

By the other hand, FoxPro evolved to VFP that used the VB model and was 
very successfull (despite MS policies about it :) ).

Now, the idea of an easy to use, user friendly and smart OOP still alive 
and is very succefull in the Ruby programming language.


The Ruby creator (Yukihiro Matsumoto) had said this, about his language:

"Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. 
They think, "By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, 
the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will 
something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in 
fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing 
programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the 
masters. They are the slaves."

An important part of the mainstream is occuped by VB and Ruby today.

I'm fully sure that sooner or later this concept will prevail and that 
bussiness/database programmers will not feel obligated to use low level 
tools anymore.

I fully agree, of course :)

Roberto.

Hi Roberto
Ruby have 11 position in language from tiobe ranking
http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html
Follow is good trend of Ruby
http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/paperinfo/tpci/Ruby.html

The better choice for business/database programmers are :
Harbour, because in 4gl spirit include data manipulation in token of
language and not only in class
Rubi as easy dynamic, interpreted ,language that integrated with a
framework like rail and SQL Module will done works
Delphi .or Vb.net way but with an Client server database like Ms sql
server or Postgress
Microsoft access (that with 2010 version will allow true web
application), and will be a highly productive platform where develop
Other choice can be Oracle Form,Powerbuilder, PeopleTools and
SiebelTool or at least 4 dimension or filemaker
The true advantage in software Development is not OOP but sql
languages that allow write easy program also if a good class is easy
to use like demonstrated by vb paradigm

The growing popularity of ORMs are an example. New generation
languages (Python, Ruby etc. and even Java) have shifted focus to
using ORMs rather than SQL directly. Now instead of explicit SQL
statements, ActiveRecord (Ruby's Object Relational Mapper) uses
something like

emp=Employee.new
emp.name = "Emp1"
emp.basic = 4500
emp.designation = "Programmer"
emp.save

This syntax closely resembles the tight integration between the
language and database for the xBase languages. A comparable Clipper
syntax was

Employee->name = "Emp1"

The advantage of ORM is that programmers can write database code that
are not specific to the back-end engine. This is also strikingly
similar to the Clipper concept of RDDs.

Ruby, Python and Javascript do not force the entire OOP boilerplate -
unlike the SmallTalk based languages like Java and C++. Ruby and
JavaScript are considered 'Object Based' rather than 'Object Oriented'
and allows the programmer to write procedural and object oriented code
with same ease.

Robert, IMHO Clipper also was more in the object based spirit and its
object orientation was not at all a drastic change. The learning curve
was pretty small and programmers used to the old procedural style
could easily adopt to the object notations.

Do you have some experience with using the ORM (or OODBMS)  model ?
By using what programming languages ?

I like the ORM based approach, even I've used in the past an comercial
product (CACHE by Intersystems), but now I have an Harbour based
approach. And currently I'm developing some of my new projects with
Harbour and this approach (that is more closer to the OODBMS model)
to deal with complex data structures and relations between.

I am very intrested from ORM path because i think that is natural
evolution of rdd
googleing i have  find
 Quickdb  http://code.google.com/p/quickdb/
 QtPersistence is a project to create an ORM and persistence library
for Qt Users. (Active Record and Data Mapper Ruby ) ORM projects.
 Linq by microsoft as powerfull orm mapper

Can you point me usefull link about orm?
Do you think that a ORM implementation is possible in harbour?
Can I invite you partecipate to harbour developer mailing list

I personally believe that FoxPro evolution path was, by far, much more 
inline with the original xBase philosophy.

I've prefered that Clipper evolve in such way too.

The last I'd used was FoxPro 2.6 for DOS. I guess I don't know enough
to contrast. It'd be great if you could elaborate a little on it.

Massimo,

ORMs usually enable us to declare multiple objects, which might have
the data for different records in a single table. This could be
implemented easily on top of an SQL based database. But for native
engines like DBFCDX, we'll need to have a unique ID field for every
table to quickly commit the various record objects already loaded into
memory.

I am not much into Harbour development, however I'll try to contribute
if an ORM implementation is in the pipeline.

Hi Teo,

I don't have any experience with OODBMS but I've been using the
ActiveRecords ORM in Ruby for sometime. Some of the few advantages I
found were:

* In the explict SQL method, we first generate an SQL statement and
concatenate the required values into it. something like:
	sql="select * from employee where basic > " + str(min_basic)

In this approach, we'll have to take care of SQL Injection and also
convert to and from our native data type. We've to remember to add
single quotes to string values,  format dates into the format of
whatever database we're using etc etc. However an ORM abstracts away
all these complexities and we can use our native data types
seamlessly.

* A database record can be persisted into memory easily - like in
xBase. Once we declare an object to represent a record in our table,
we can use the columns similar in Clipper to accessing fields from a
workarea.

Ruby ActiveRecord code:
        emp=Employee.find(20)       // Loads the record with id 20
into the emp object.
	print emp.name				// In Clipper: Use Employee index emp_id; seek 20;
qout(Employee->name)
	print emp.basic

* Latest version of ActiveRecord (Rails 3) presents an intuitive way
of representing conditions. You may read about it in the 'New API'
section at http://m.onkey.org/2010/1/22/active-record-query-interface.
An advanced discussion is at http://github.com/rails/arel

@Massimo Belgrano

I have this link [1] I used when I'm developing a Java project using
Hibernate [2]. I used some other materials I studied for a seminar I
presented on ORM topic, in the college. Django [3][4] (a Python web
framework) uses a more "lightweight" aproach for object-relational
mapping. Python also have SQLAlchemy [5] wich is largely used. The
topic is complex [6] and need a deep dive into the details. It isn't
like to assign a value to an object that represents a database. Many
patterns [7] are applied in order to get the best results for
performance and liability.

It is heartening that someone else from Harbour world has 

experience with CACHE.

 

Last year I announced the general availability of 

cacheRDD - http://cacherdd.vouch.info/ but then withdraw it 

due to certain reasons.

 

BTW this is an excellant database, though a costly affair.

Subject: [Harbour-users] ORMs (from "thread" GUI programming)
Message-ID: <4664.1268780218@people.net.au>

 Hi all

 Its nice to see that a discussion that started out with some highly
questionable
 assertions about OOP has turned right around to a discussion of ORMs
which 
 essentially extend the OOP concept.

 Harbour doesn't force OOP on anyone, but I suspect most savvy xBase
coders head 
 that way.? Even those that write procedural code are using some objects,
 hidden from them by the preprocessor.? Beginners soon realise that they
are
 writing code that pretty much does something similar to what they have
done
 before.? At first they may use the "cut and paste" approach.? Most then
come to 
 realise that this approach is not ideal because

 1. Its easy to miss bits of code that need to be altered

 2. To change "standard behaviour" you have to change code in many places

 So most of us ended up with a whole series of "utility functions" which
 identified (as parameters) those things that changed from invocation to
 invocation and meant that standard behaviour could be changed by altering
a
 single piece of code.

 OOP basically extends this in a more powerful and consistent way.

 But if you don't like writing "standard" Harbour OOP code that might look
like

 obj_MyWindow := TWindow():New( 500, 300, "Sample Window" )

 you can use the preprocessor and write something like

 CREATE WINDOW myWindow TITLE "Sample Window" SIZE 500, 300

 all it takes is a preprocessor directive like

 #xcommand CREATE WINDOW  TITLE  SIZE ,  => ;
  := TWindow():New( , ,  )

 That is one of the fundamental beauties of xBase.

 I would also note that the popularity of VB is due to Microsoft's
marketing power and the fact
 that many of us are effectively forced to use it (or its sibling VBA) to
automate office type tasks.
 If you judged languages by their popularity you wouldn't be using Harbour
despite the fact
 that its so wonderful a language.

 Now onto the interesting part - ORMs.

 These should fit very neatly into Harbour.? Take an "example" from a 
 previous post:

 emp=Employee.new
 emp.name = "Emp1"
 emp.basic = 4500
 emp.designation = "Programmer"
 emp.save

 Harbour equivalents are easy:

 obj_Employee := TEmployee():New()
 WITH OBJECT obj_Employee
 ? :Name := "Emp1"
 ? :Basic := 4500
 ? :Designation := "Programmer"
 ? :Save()
 END

 Of course there are many alternatives (depending in part on the TEmployee
class) such as

 obj_Employee := TEmployeeNew( "Emp1", 4500, "Programmer" )
 obj_Employee:Save()

 Or with suitable preprocessor directive for those that like the object
orientation hidden

 CREATE EMPLOYEE ThisEmployee
 ThisEmployee:Name := "Emp1"
 ThisEmployee:Basic := 4500
 ThisEmployee:Designation := Programmer
 SAVE EMPLOYEE ThisEmployee

 Obviously we have to define the TEmployee Class which would inherit from
a class that
 "understands" how to read / write etc but not the particular details of
an employee record,
 something like:

 CLASS TEmployee FROM TSingleRecord

 ? DATA Name
 ? DATA Basic
 ? DATA Designation
 ? // etc

 ENDCLASS

 Methods like Save() would be inherited from TSingleRecord as might its
oid (object 
 identifier / primary key )

 CLASS TSingleRecord

 ? DATA oid
 ? // etc

 ? METHOD Save()
 ? // etc

 ENDCLASS

 This is very much along the lines of the approach I use combined with a
client-server data 
 base back end I wrote for my own use.? A record is returned as a
two-dimensional array that
 can be used to directly update the front end object.? The array is
serialsed and transmitted
 using IP sockets.? Properties are directly updated using
__ObjSetValueList().? This type of
 approach would seem ideal for an ORM in my opinion.

 xProgrammer

I'll add that to fulfill this approach, we need to have at least:

  * Abstraction
  * Inheritance
  * Polymorphism

e.g., The following sample creates  three new databases:
  TEmployer 
  TPerson
  TEmployee

fills the databases with some values and then prints it out:

<prg>
/* Contains the Employer's database */
CLASS TEmployer FROM TTable
  DATA tableName INIT "employer" // the physical file data base
  DEFINE FIELDS  // Load the Field's information
ENDCLASS

BEGIN FIELDS CLASS TEmployer

  /* the primary key database */
  ADD PRIMARYKEY FIELD "Employer" AUTOINCREMENTAL
	
  ADD STRING FIELD "FirstName" SIZE 100

  ADD STRING FIELD "LastName" SIZE 100
	
  ADD STRING "Phone" SIZE 40

  /* creates a TEmployees table whos MasterSource
     is this database (TEmployer) */
  ADD OBJECT FIELD "Employees" CLASS "TEmployee"

END FIELDS

/* Contains the Person's database */
CLASS TPerson FROM TTable
  DATA tableName INIT "persemp" // the physical file data base

  DEFINE FIELDS // Load the Field's information
	
  /* calculated fields */
  CALCFIELD Age INLINE Years( ::Field_Birth )
  CALCFIELD FullName INLINE RTrim( ::Field_LastName ) + ", " + RTrim( ::Field_FirstName )
	
ENDCLASS

BEGIN FIELDS CLASS TPerson

  /* the primary key database */
  ADD PRIMARYKEY FIELD "Person" AUTOINCREMENTAL

  ADD STRING FIELD "FirstName" SIZE 40

  ADD DATE FIELD "Birth" ;
    VALID {|d| Year( d ) > 1850 } /* validation for field */

  ADD STRING FIELD "Genre" ;
    VALID {|g| g $ "FM" } /* validation for field */

END FIELDS

/* Contains the Employee's database */
CLASS TEmployee FROM TPerson
  DEFINE FIELDS // Load the Field's information
  CALCFIELD Age INLINE Years( ::Field_HiredOn )
ENDCLASS

BEGIN FIELDS CLASS TEmployee

  /* the master key database */
  ADD OBJECT FIELD "Employer" CLASS "TEmployer" MASTERKEY

  ADD FLOAT FIELD "Salary" ;
    VALID {|s| s >= 0 } /* validation for field */
		
  ADD DATE FIELD "HiredOn" ;
    VALID {|d| Year( d ) > 1850 } /* validation for field */

  /* the primary key database */
  ADD PRIMARYKEY FIELD "Person"
		
END FIELDS


FUNCTION Main()

  emp := TEmployer():New()
  
  /* adds a new TEmployer record */
  emp:NewRecord()
  
  emp:Field_Name := "US ROBOTICS"

xProgrammer,

If you read carefully my post, you'll note that I'M NOT judging VB by 
its popularity (that is only a side note about it).

<...>

 > marketing power
<...>

I'm not questioning MS marketing power, but, as you surely know, they 
failed many, many times trying to impose products and technologies, 
simply because those were not good enough.

IMHO, VB succedeed because it was (at least until 6.0 version) a great 
development tool.

Regarding Harbour, if you feel that I'm attacking it (through my 
opinions about Clipper), that was not my intention.

I loved dBase, I loved Fox and I loved Clipper too (despite some things:)).

I'm here because Harbour is great. Whitout a doubt, it is the best 
choice for whose that (like me) love xBase.

Finally, regarding OOP, I guess that we must open our minds to new ideas 
and programming paradigms.

To write an operating system service is a very different task that 
creating a simple database application.

IMHO, should be obvious for someone, that an unique programming 
model/paradigm, could be not able to suit the programmers needs for all 
situations.

Fortunately, many modern languages developers understand this.

Roberto.

<snip>

Interesting (I mean it) lesson on OOP basics.
What I' d have to point out, from an old clipper-programmer's POV,
is that OOP introduces a *structured complexity* which in some/many 
cases is unnecessary, wasteful in resources, and infrastructure/learning 
demanding.
(not to mention those tongue-tie, virus-like "T"s that dominates the 
classes name-space for absolutely useless reasons denoting an immanent 
adoration to stereotypes, which is one of the unwelcome features of OOP 
model. But again, maybe I'm wrong since i am not a theorist of 
programming art. That said, i feel just fully covered by Roberto Lopez 
phrase that  "regarding OOP, I guess that we must open our minds to new 
ideas and programming paradigms. To write an operating system service is 
a very different task that creating a simple database application.
IMHO, should be obvious for someone, that an unique programming

 I agree with Teo but with one proviso and that is that the client classes
should be largely table agnostic.? By that I mean that:

 creating say an object of class Person nothing is happening at the data
base level.? That will only happen when we choose to Write() [In my case
write is a method that handles both insert and update but that's just a
personal preference.]

 In practice I typically only need one such class but have a Blank()
method - possibly not the best of names since while most fields will be
set to blank in a typical situation some fields will have default or even
mandatory contents.? [My Blank() method is partt of the front end class.]

 The front end wouldn't therefore have a TTable Class, although the back
end might. [My current approach has a TQuery class as well as DataItem
class amongst others but no TTable class in the back end.]

 I also note that I would have multiple front end classes eg a TPersonList
Class as well as a TPersonClass (both of which hold data) then
"presentation layer" classes for desplaying that data (TPersonListScreen,
TpersonViewRditScreen) as well as classes relating to acquiring input for
those searches (eg TPersonSearchBySurname, TPersonSearchByDOB,
TPersonSearchByKey).? That sort of evolved as being the neatest IMO but I
understand (retrospectively) that it represents pretty much the pure OOP
approach (not that I am a great believer in theory).

 I guess that shows the remnants of the "three layer architecture" that
Microsoft was pushing some years back.

 Just my thoughts

 Hi all

 Loving this discussion!

 I'm an old programmer who wrote procedural code for many years and paid
scant regard to OOP when the theoreticians started to push it.? Now I'm a
bit of a convert.? That happened through a rather ambitious project from
the pre .Net days that built web pages that behaved like traditional
programmes "on the fly" and did some of the things that I understand .Net
does well before Microsoft got around to it.? It is still used to this
day.? The point is that when I looked at the structure of the data base
that I had to build to hold the specification of the application what I
had seemed to correspond pretty much to the language of OOP.

 Up until then I had used OOP a bit (when forced to pretty much) but that
experience opened ny eyes a bit.? I still didn't write much OOP type code
until I discovered Harbour.? Even then it took a while as I started off
where I had left Clipper coding probably 10 years before.? But once I got
the hang of it again and saw how beautifully it fitted into the xBase
language and how you could hide the details if you so desired, I find
myself even thinking in terms of objects / classes etc most of the time.

 If OOP isn't suitable for your application then don't use it and forget
the theorists BUT please remember that if OOP approach is making things
more complex, slower etc it MAY not be that OOP is unsuitable, but rather
that your application of OOP may be sub optimal.

 I would love to share the architecture of my client-server data base back
end (written in Harbour) and / or code but I have to drive kids to school
just at the moment.

 BTW I love cBase, OOP and client-server architecture, am not fond of SQL
and loathe UML

Adding a few thoughts:

OOP has been widely portrayed as an overkill for writing code that
simply gets things done. All the 'inheritance', 'abstraction',
'polymorphism' kind of buzzwords did a lot of harm to the perception
regarding OOP. And most of it is thanks to C++ and Java. Here is an
interesting take on the origin of C++:
http://artlung.com/smorgasborg/Invention_of_Cplusplus.shtml

However, the new generation scripting languages like Python, Ruby and
JavaScript (and to a great extent VB 3 till VB 6) have taken some of
the best practical aspects from OOP and threw away the rest. I'm very
happy to program in these languages without worrying about 'friend'
functions or 'pure virtual methods' (!). When talking about OOP in
Harbour, I hope to see an adoption that resembles the pragmatism of
the scripting languages than the hard theoretical OOP like in C++.

One of the posts mentioned the namings of class variables - TWindow,
TForm, TWindow::TForm etc:
> (not to mention those tongue-tie, virus-like "T"s that dominates the classes name-space for absolutely useless reasons

I agree with Pete very much. I think we've rooted ourselves firmly in
the Clipper-style OOP notations like TBrowse, TBColumnNew etc. and
have sincerely followed that path. However, except for the enterprisy
languages (C++, Java, C# etc.), the new agile languages all favour
using lower case for denoting classes and variables. This could add a
lot to the readabilty of the code (IMHO) YMMV.

If I'm not mistaken, you mean the Model-View-Controller paradigm (MVC
for short). It seems you've successfully baked your very own MVC. For
the Web, MVC has caught on like fire and I've personally found it to
be a great modular architecture.

 Hi all

 Re the naming of classes:

 Prefixing class names with a T I think originates with Borland
products.? The main reason I adopted it was that at one point in time at
least Harbour treated it as an error if your source file and class had the
same name.? That is you couldn't have a file named patient.prg containing
a class patient.? One solution was to name the source file
patient_class.prg but in the end I adopted the T prefix for the class name
instead.? It's probably not still an issue with Harbour - I just haven't
checked - but the habit has stuck.

 As for readability I personally find MedicalPractice easier to "read"
than medicalpractice so thats how I name them (actually I use a prefix so
an object would be obj_MedicalPractice.? Of course xBase folds everything
to upper case anyhow so people can share classes and adopt their own
conventions.

 I know my prefixes are longer ( I use obj_ whereas I guess "the norm" -
if there is one - would be just o.? So I would have obj_Person rather
than oPerson or if you don't like capitalisation I guess operson or drop
the prefix and just have person.? Again the latter might be a tad
confusing if that is also the name of your class.? I like to use a wide
range of prefixes - for example I will usr fh_ for a file handle (a
specilaised form of int_), dlg_ for a dialog (a specialised form of obj_)
etc

 I'm not tyrying to push my way of doing things (which has changed over
the years so my older code doesn't match the new style) but rather just
explain the reasons I have reached the style I use now. 

 Re the structure of my client-server data base back end (presumably much
in common with a client server ORM)

 Will take a number of posts to explain.? Data (for a single item) is
transmitted as a two dimensional array contained in a wrapper array.

 Looking at the inner two dimensional array first.

 Assume I have a class as follows:

 CLASS Person

 ? DATA FamilyName
 ? DATA GivenName
 ? DATA Gender
 ? DATA DOB

 ENDCLASS

 Now if I have an array as follows:

 arr_MyData := { { "FamilyName", "Citizen" }, { "GivenName", "Joe" }, {
"Gender", "M" },? { "DOB", "19601231" } }

 I can set all the properties of an object of class Person? with

 __ObjSetValueList( self, arr_MyData )

 [I have assumed that code is in a member function of class Person if not
then assuming we have obj_ThisPerson you would have

 __ObjSetValueList( obj_ThisPerson, arr_MyData ) ]

 That is the basic mechanism my code uses.

 However we have to allow for the back end encountering a problem so I
wrap this array up? as the second element of an array, the first element
of which is an array containing success and / or failure information.? So
the back end can flag success, a problem that might make retrying
worthwhile or one that is unrecoverable.? And I allow for a series of
error messages / warnings.

 This wrapper array is built on the back end, then the function
HB_Serialize() is used to convert to a binary string which is then
transmitted to the client using IP sockets where assuming success is
indicated the data array is recreated using HB_Deserialize() and used to
update the properties of the object as per the above discussion.

 This approach has proved to be robust and can be used with front and back
end on a single machine or a cross a network or VPN.

 My back end "knows" that the contents of field PN_SURNAME should be
returned paired with the expected property name "FamilyName" .

 I can share how that works in a further post if anyone is interested.

Hi xProgrammer,

I'm not sure what you mean by "getting mangled". I do read harbour.user 
mailing list through my e-mail client (thunderbird). I'm also receiving 
a daily-digest in my yahoo.mail account. In both, all posts (yours 
included) seem to be ok. The only "problem" i have noticed so far, in 
the digest version, is that in your posts show up in some places "odd" 
characters which, i suppose, are tab characters (perhaps not correctly 
decoded?) but this little-to-none effect has to your text regarding 
readability.

(By the way, I (and it's not only me, i think) find much interesting 
your posts about your client-server implementation.)

regards,

Hello, i'm trying to compile the simplest application using harbour 2.0

Borland C++ 5.5.1 for Win32 Copyright (c) 1993, 2000 Borland

This program was compiled in the past using Harbour, but it seems that 
some changes had been done at .lib level.
So, what libs should i use as a minimum, or at least which one do i have 
to add now to avoid this error?
And also; where can i check wich libs contain wich functions so i have 
not ask in the future?

Thanks.

Subject: [Harbour-users] Suggest we consolidate discussions concerning ORM
	concept
Message-ID: <20637.1269383129@people.net.au>

 Hi all

 This topic seems to have separate discussions going on in the harbour and
harbour-users lists and the two seem rather disconnected.? I suggest that
we might all get a lot further if we consolidate the discussion into one
of the two lists.? At this stage the most important questions probably
relate to what users may or may not want, so on that basis I would suggest
the harbour-users list but I would be happy either way.

 If we were to develop an "ORM" or "OODBMS" or whatever you want to call
such a thing it shouldn't require any change to the xBase language as
currently implemented.

 I am no software theorist but I have played with an OO database - is that
an ORM? - and in my opinion such an approach does provide advantages over
what is already implemented in the xBase language.? These presumably
include:

 application client receives data in a more readily usable format
 "scatter gather" (I think that is what people call it) happens
automatically
 automate much of the process of persistence (eg object id / primary key
allocation)
 application can make a single request to persist an object that contains
other objects (cf multiple SQL statements if using an SQL based data
server)
 depending on how the server stores the data more flexibility in the
structure of what you store

It's platform dependent issue.
In DOS programs handler 5 is open for each application and points
to "PRN" device.
This is only DOS behavior which does not exist in all other OS-es
which do not give process any special 5 handler and you have to
open connection to given device. In Windows builds we explicitly
set device name to "LPT1" but in *nix builds is "|lpr" what means
PIPE to lpr process.

Massimo,

Ok, but and if computer has not LPT1 port ?

Perhaps, at least for Windows, when there isn't LPT1 port default device
should GetDefaultPrinter()..
Perhaps, too, we should can set device default for SET PRINTER TO...

 Thank you very much !

which do not give process any special 5 handler and you have to
open connection to given device. In Windows builds we explicitly
set device name to "LPT1" but in *nix builds is "|lpr" what means
PIPE to lpr process.

Subject: [Harbour-users] anything about set printer to
Message-ID: <hogksv$cli$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hi,

Is now possible :

SET PRINT ON
SET PRINTER TO (GetDefaultPrinter()

@ 1, 10 SAY "I am compatible with Clipper and xHarbour"

SET PRINTER TO
SET DEVICE TO SCREEN

Hi All,
Above extension works in xhb but is not supported
in Harbour. Actually for good reason, so my intent
is not to propose it for inclusion, but I still wonder
what is the easiest way (least code change) to achieve
the same result in Harbour.
[ NOTICE: This feature can only work if printer
controls codes match those supported by the printer,
and it's easily possible the printer doesn't support
raw input _at all_. Plus it makes SET PRINTER TO
incompatible. ]
---
SET PRINTER TO ( win_PrinterGetDefault() )
...
SET PRINTER TO
---
is equivalent to something like this in Harbour:
--- [untested]
LOCAL cTempName
FClose( hb_FTempCreateEx( @cTempName ) )
SET PRINTER TO ( cTempName )
...
SET PRINTER TO
win_PrintFileRaw( win_PrinterGetDefault(), cTempName )
FErase( cTempName )
---
Anyhow, this is my suggestion to xhb users wanting
to switch to Harbour. If you know a better way, pls
speak up.
Brgds,
Viktor

Subject: [Harbour-users] Error Logging
Message-ID: <4BB17148.3040304@gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have a program that opens several windows with WOpen(). But when an 
error occurs, I can't trace the program caused the error because the 
error message is written to the window, and just after the error popup 
closed, the windows are also closed. How can I change this behaviour, 
e.g. to write the error trace message to a log file.

I once had a program that when an error occured, it wrote to a file 
hb_out.log or something. But I can't find how to get it in my new 
program. I'm using Harbour 2.0 on Linux and GCC.

Thank you,
Agustianes.

I would like to get some documentation about graphical user interface 
programming on Harbour.

I can't find anything about gtwvg and would like to start on GUI, but 
i'm stuck. I've read a lot about using that library for programming gui 
applications, but absolutely nothing about how to.

I finally achieve to compile hwgui, so i also achieved to compile my old 
app using it.
But now i have a console window opened at the same time the GUI application.
My app compiled about 2 years ago, using the same procedure and 
libs(changed names since then) does not open any console window.

sample: http://s3.subirimagenes.com:81/imagen/previo/thump_4289108ejemo.png

I think i have read something about gt libs is that right? but i cant 
find it now.
Should i use anything special? should i not use something?

Thanks in advance.
I'm using the following libs:

hwgui.lib +
procmisc.lib +
hbxml.lib +
hwg_qhtm.lib +

I did not wrote any documentation on GTWVG, the only source 

on this topic is contrib/gtwvg/tests/demowvg.prg. It has everything

you need to start experimenting.
