Sirs:

I work for a window manufacturing company.  The production software is
written in clipper 5.2.  It has been running for 15 years or so, and
is composed of multitudes of programs, most somewhat intertwined.  I
have written most of it and modified the rest over the years.

I use the standard dbfntx clipper files for storage.
The file server is running ubuntu linux with samba 3.0.22.

I am attempting to run some of the programs compiled with harbour from
linux computers in a shared environment with a bunch of windows
computers running programs compiled with 5.2

There are a number of places where the programs create .dbf and .dbt
files.  When you create a .dbf file with dbcreate(), clipper 5.2
forces the filenames and extensions to uppercase.

If the .dbf file has a memo file with it, I am unable to open it with
harbour 1.0.  Harbour attempts to open the memo file with a .dbt in
lowercase extension.

Any notion about how to get around this problem?

Given time, I can probably find the place in the harbour source that
sets the file extension and make it try both upper and lower case when
it adds an extension.

Is there a better way?
Is there any hope of getting one of you guys who know the code to
either do it, or at least to point me to the correct file and
function(s) where the changes would need to happen?

Thanks in advance,
Jim Hurlburt

  * harbour/include/hbapi.h
  * harbour/source/common/hbstr.c
    + added hb_strlow()

  * harbour/source/rtl/fstemp.c
  * harbour/source/rtl/filesys.c
    ! fixed _SET_DIRSEPARATOR behavior - now it's always set to default
      OS directory separator what means no translations. If you want to
      enable some translations then it should be set to other value, f.e.
      in *nixes:
         set( _SET_DIRSEPARATOR, "\" )
      enables translations of "\" in paths to "/"

  * harbour/source/main/harbour.c
    + added support for new compiler switches:
         - Filename casing:
               -fn:l       (lower)
               -fn:u       (upper)
               -fn-        (disable - default)
               -fn         (disable - default)
         - Directory casing
               -fd:l       (lower)
               -fd:u       (upper)
               -fd-        (disable - default)
               -fd         (disable - default)
         - Path separator:
               -fp:<char>
               -fp         (default: OS defined)
         - Filename space trimming:
               -fs         (enable)
               -fs-        (disable - default)
      These switches works only in standalone compiler.
      When compiler is linked with HVM and RTL then corresponding
      _SET_* switches are used instead.

I hope this will help you.

Hi!
These functions work fine with xHarbour but not run with Harbour.
If remove "//" also does not work.

*******************************
Function Imprime(cArq,cPrint)
*******************************
*
*
Local oPrn, aPrn:=GetPrinters()
if empty(aPrn)
   MsgInfo( 'Not Print' )
   return .f.
endif
If cPrint == Nil
 cPrint := GetDefaultPrinter()
EndIf

  //Set Printer to (GetDefaultPrinter() )
 //Set(_SET_PRINTER)
 //Set(_SET_PRINTFILE)
 //Set Console Off
 //Set Printer On
 nRet := PrintFileRaw(cPrint,cArq,'Pedido')
 if nRet < 1
   MsgStop('Error Printing: '+rtrim(str(nRet)))
 EndIf

 //Linhas := mlcount(txt,nCol)
 //For i:=1 to Linhas
 //   ? rTrim(MemoLine(txt,nCol,i,,,.f.))
 //Next
 //Set Printer Off
 //Set Console On
 //Set Printer to
 Return .t.

Adam:

I'm sorry, but I don't follow how to use the below.
When I look at the source, I don't find any of it.  No doubt looking
the the wrong places

The compiler flags don't seem to work.
I have it compiled, what seemed to be pretty much the default choices
on a linux box running ubuntu 7.10  amd64.  Version is 1.0.0  The
latest one

I have hunted what I could and don't follow the reference to the
_SET_* switches either.  I am probably missing something, but don't
find them in the harbour docs.

Perhaps a brief example of how to get a case insensitive dbusearea()
to work or a pointer to such?
Or any other help would be most appreciated.

Main reason for the delay in reply is that I have been busy having a
cold the last week.  Sorry for the delay.
