Hi all:

I?m new at the Harbour, downloaded the latest build (1.0.0).
Now, I want to create some small Windows32 exe, but I really don?t get it...

For now, I found a BAT called BLD, which generates .c output and then its 
supposed to link with MSVC to create the exe.

LINK persistantly fails with a LNK1107 error.

I feel I make some mistake on the compiler o link parameters.  Can anybody 
tell me which are the correct parameters / switches for Harbour compiler and 
link?

TIA, Jan Sperling

Use bld_b32 for BCC
You can find more sample compiled using it.
