Hi,

This function is from funck(y) fTempName("t*.tmp"). 
Is there a function in Harbour nearly like this?

TIA,
Jerry

In Harbour you have:

nFh := HB_FTempCreateEx( @fileName, [cDir], [cPrefix], [cExt], [nAttr] )

returns "nFh" which is the file handle for the new created file.

"fileName" is the file name and is returned by reference.

"cDir" is the path used to create the file. (you can use
  HB_DirTemp() here as parameter).

"cPrefix" is the file name prefix desired.

"cExt" is the file name extension desired.

"nAttr" is the file attribute.

Note that if you need to use the fileName as the file name for
another process, you need to close the file handle returned:

FClose( HB_FTempCreateEx( @fileName, NIL, NIL, ".dbf" ) )


best regards,

Teo

Hi Teo,

nFh := HB_FTempCreateEx( @fileName, [cDir], [cPrefix], [cExt], [nAttr])
Found this in harbour source

FClose( HB_FTempCreateEx( @fileName, NIL, NIL, ".dbf" ) ) 
Never thought of this.

Very clever trick.


Thanks

Hello,
I need your help:

When I create an array in C:

pArray = hb_itemNew (NULL);
hb_arrayNew (pArray, size);

before the program ends I have necessarily to call:

hb_itemRelease (pArray);

to free the memory allocated? 
or HARBOUR releases automatically?

thank you very much,
Claudio Soto

Hello, i'm starting a new program, and for the fist time i'm intended to 
start using a database server instead of .dbf files.
Due the fact my customer has a MySQL server installed, i'm planning to 
use that.
Also there is no issues about permissions since i have full admin access 
to it.

I would appreciate any guidance on how to manage data on MySQL server, 
i'm only used to .dbf files and i'm kind of lost here.

Tanks in advance.

If I were you, I'd just download the Nightly Source .zip file, and if you're
on Windows, download TDM mingw32 (google for it) and compile it yourself
using  "win-make install".

IMO better
"win-make clean install".
because incremental mode must be disabled

In order to compile and use with mysql you need to compile harbour with

the libraries that talk with.
To do that you need to

Point to where you have the mysql libraries.
As the readme.txt in contrib/hbmysql points you should download a
version of mysql that you wish to talk with an install in your machine.
You should show harbour win-make where it have to search to mysql libraries.
Make a directory where make put the recent build (p.e. HARBOUR2).

You should put in path where you have mingw

SET HB_WITH_MYSQL=C:\mysql\include
set HB_DIR_MYSQL=C:\mysql
SET HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\HARBOUR2
set HB_BUILD_IMPLIB=yes

CD\HARBOUR
WIN-MAKE CLEAN INSTALL

Thanks for your answer, but i'm using borland and i'm intended to keep 
on it, i had so much trouble in the past to compile using others, and 
finally ended on my start.

About the rest of your msg. yes, thanks, i already downloaded mysql 
(twice for not checking what essentials is) and installed.
At this moment i'm still trying to compile HwGUI or Harbour 2.1 (asking 
on their list also)

Thanks again and best regards.

Richard,

    Give a look in: harbour/contrib/xhb/hbcompat.ch

    I suggest you to look for information on the harbour\changelog file.
    Also harbour\install
    Both are TXT files (you can rename them to have .TXT on the end to make 
it easier to open with notepad)
    It has many valuable information.
    Helps me to find things like this.

Hi,

    Does anyone know this fiscal cash register?
    This brand is not common here (this is the first one I ever seen...) anyway seems to be a good device.
    Any idea how to use it with Harbour? The manual is very short but it has a serial port adaptor. 
    Any information is welcome.
    Thanks.

Message-ID: <4BCB4216.30105@gmail.com>

Hello, i'm having this strange error when compiling my app.

    Fatal: Too many DEF file names:
    d:\programa\comps\hwgui_hb2\lib\procmisc.lib

I'm using harbour 2.1+HWgui both from SVN/CVS and Borland C 5.5

The funny thing is, if i compile only 1 prg, it's ok, it compiles and 
program runs, but as soon as i add a 2nd .prg this error comes up.

This is the compile batch file i'm using wich is the same i have used 
since entered Harbour+HWGUI world.

http://pastebin.com/Cmd5uC9U

The main prg. has only a menu, and the second .prg is blank, that's the 
strangest....(i guess)

I'm sorry if i should put this on hwgui list, but i am not receiving 
absolutely anything from them, and i have suscribed and unsuscribed 
several times.


Thanks.

Now, the file is created, but variables seem to not being read when 
"restore from varfile"

?Anything changed?

Thanks massimo, i have tryed to use it, but can't figure how to.

I use Crimson Editor to manage my text files (.prg) and some shortcuts 
ctrl+1 ctrl+2 to execute .bat compiler files... ?is there a way to fully 
automate hbmk2? ?can you give me a direction on how to use hbmk2?

you can simply insert in bat file
hbmk2 test1.prg test2.prtg testn.prg -lmylib1 -lmylib2 -lmylibn

i also suggest try hbide http://hbide.vouch.info/

oh, i was talking about hbmk2, never tried hbide.

I have tried some IDEs but never liked them, i prefer to write the full 
code myself, i feel uncomfortable with IDEs.
I come from dBase then foxpro and clipper, then harbour right at the 
beginnings and i kept always programming the same way.

Sounds good, but to some extent.

I had the same theory few years back which has changed over the time.

BTW hbIDE can be used as a text editor only mode if you are so scared of project management.

Harbour team is working hard on how it can be made more productive.

 

Give it a try, you will not repent.

I?m sorry Pripal, i'm messing ideas around, is 1AM here and i'm very tired.

I have tried some IDEs, to make forms and stuff, and i cant keep putting 
menus and windows using a mouse, i like to program character by 
character, like very old school.

I had, actually tried hbide some years ago, i followed massimo's link 
just a minute ago to hbide's page and found it familiar.
I really can't remember now what impression i had from it, i just can 
say i tried and left it.
I also tried minigui IDE, and others but noone convinced me about 
changing my way.

I'm very familiar with Crimson Editor, is more a text editor with fancy 
habilities, but i have beeing using it for over 12 years if i'm not wrong.


Thanks for your time, and best regards.

You can puy in myproject.hbp your hbmk2 command line
------myproject.hbp ----------
test1.prg
test2.prtg
testn.prg
-lmylib1
-lmylib2
-lmylibn
then you can compile using hbmk2 using
hbmk2 myproject.hbp

hbide use same project format so you can use
hbide myproject.hbp
Hbide allow compile you source with one click and if your source
contain error  with a double click on red row of error showed you go
to line that caused error and this is a big improvements in
productivity.

Hbide have a short and string history so i suggest try last version
you can find same info regarding here my blog
(http://harbourlanguage.blogspot.com/) about hbide and i suggest try
last version from http://hbide.vouch.info/

You recover time used on hbide with boost on productivity

Last version hbide allow keyboard customization so you can give
Crimson Editor's aspect,

do so but couldn't start the program it 'installed'.

Thanks.

Hi,

Hello,

I'm completely new to Harbour after having used Clipper 5.0 under DOS
for quite a few years. Having downloaded and installed Harbour version
2.0.0 on OSX without any problems (ie error messages), I've run into
trouble compiling the test program:

prompt>hbmk2 hello
hbmk2: Processing configuration: /usr/local/bin/hbmk.cfg
Harbour 2.0.0 (Rev. 13372)
Copyright (c) 1999-2010, http://www.harbour-project.org/

ld: library not found for -lharbour
hbmk2: Error: Running linker. 1
clang hello.o   -lhbcplr -lhbdebug -lharbour  -o hello -L/usr/local/lib/harbour
prompt>

As you can see everything is installed in /usr/local/{bin,lib,include}/

I have installed Apple's Xcode 3.22 (2148) prior to installing Harbour
(guess that's a given, otherwise it wouldn't have compiled from
source)

The /usr/local/bin/hbmk.cfg contains:
#hbmk2 configuration
# Generated by Harbour build process

libpaths=../contrib/%{hb_name}
libpaths=../contrib/rddsql/%{hb_name}
libpaths=../addons/%{hb_name}
libpaths=../examples/%{hb_name}

Can anyone kindly point me towards the right direction to get started
with Harbour on OSX ?

Thanks in advance!

This is because hbmk2 tries to link with shared libraries and this are
not found.

You can bypass this by linking with static libs:

$ hbmk2 -static hello


Or, you can provide the missing shared lib with:

$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/harbour/libharbour.2.1.0.dylib /usr/local/lib/harbour/libharbour.dylib
$ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/harbour

the above will create a symbolic link to the shared harbour lib
and set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to point were it is.

then you will have working right the following:

$ hbmk2 hello
$ ./hello

[snip]

HTH


best regards,

Teo

Works like a charm - thank you much for quick and to-the-point answer!
Much appreciated!

Good to be back on Clipper again, never thought my old 16bit DOS
programs would emerge as 64bit OSX applications :-)

Does Harbour build with Leopard ? I tried building Harbour on my Leopard,
however:

*libtool: can't locate file for: -lpcre
libtool: file: -lpcre is not an object file (not allowed in a library)

I've done a 'port install pcre'. But no avail.

My gcc is :

libtool:

Message-ID: <h2y510ae69e1004201048ob44897f5vbebd154eec6184b7@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to compile the sample program found in harbour's
contrib/hbhpdf directory on OSX.

I have modified the hbhpdf.hbc file from the tests directory to
contain the following:

#
# $Id: hbhpdf.hbc 12643 2009-10-04 19:56:27Z vszakats $
#

incpaths=.

libs=hbhpdf
libs=libhpdf
libs=libpng

# END OF FILE

(ie to force it to use libpng rather than png on OSX)

However, that only gets me a small step further, as compile fails with
the following:

hbmk2: Processing local make script: hbmk.hbm
hbmk2: Processing configuration: /usr/local/bin/hbmk.cfg

I guess it goes without saying that the step up from Clipper Summer
'87 to Harbour is a bit daunting, so my apologies in advance for
possibly stupid questions. Haven't found anything on Google though, so
I was hoping somebody here might offer some insight on where to look.

Thanks much in advance!

Hmm - I didn't do any of that. I simply installed the Xbuild and
figured I'd have a go with as few modifications and additions as
possible, and it works well *so far*.
However, harbour built very well, though without X11 as I'm building
console-based only

I'm building from harbour-2.0.0.tar.gz from SF. Could you tell the process
you followed.. what  was Xbuild?

Thanks.

Hello, i have tried to compile hbide, but found a lot of errors, first 
include files wich i have copied to hbide folder, then it throws a lot

?Any thoughts?

I compile fine with
 hbmk2 hbide.hbp -rebuild
 you need hbqt,hbxbp and can do recompiling harbour as explained in
install (please read it)
with simple pointing where you have
download qt  http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-4.5.3-mingw.exe
Install and set path to your c compiler
HB_WITH_QT=C:\Qt\include
win-make clean install

I think your hbc file is wrong

take a look at tests folder in harupdf contrib folder and take a look too

to harupdf.hbc , and  i think your lib definition is wrong

hbct is missing

and you hace twice set : libhpdf

and is :

libs=hbhpdf
libs=libhpdf

I used the harupdf.hbc as starting point and only removed the
incorrect (under OSX) libpng tests.

I have added this file, but it made no difference - its the
png-symbols that seem to be missing though

Nope - I use hbhpdf and libhpdf, as the original .hbc file said:

Are you saying that these are the same and only one of them should be
used? If so, why is the original .hbc file in tests/ using both?

Thanks again for answering

Subject: [Harbour-users] Harbour + MySQL = myHeadache
Message-ID: <4BD06F4F.6070508@gmail.com>

I'm trying to make my first program to use MySQL server instead of .dbf 
files.
I tried to use hbmysql from contrib

The thing is, the sample provided with hbmysql may be anything but 
clear, i tryed to compile it and it does not compile, just throws : 
Unresolved external '_HB_FUN_TMYSQLSERVER

There is no explanation about what is doing at any part, so i can't 
figure anything to change or seek.
And as there is no explanation about any line, i can't either figure 
what to take and use on my own program.

I really don't like to waste time by studying samples and test+error 
without any base about functioning. I learned programming from books 
with the basic explanations about every function first and only then the 
samples to show usage. With harbour there are samples and not 
explanations is anti-natural for me.

I have been searching around contribs and found rddsql, wich it seems 
that has the same programming way of using a .dbf file.
could this ease my pain?
will this work on mySQL or it is for SQL?
is that easy as it seems?

?Is there any other simpler way to go mySQL?


Thanks.

Message-ID: <4BD07DE4.6030905@gmail.com>

I'm trying rddsql, compile my program and everything is ok, made ODBC 
connection and everything went fine, i run the program wich actually is 
the test provided with rddsql and runs without errors....

But this test does not create the intended database on mysql server.

?where may i be failing?

Thanks.

//   DBGOTOP()
//   BROWSE()

    INDEX ON FIELD->AMOUNT TO amount
//   DBGOTOP()
//   BROWSE()
    DBCLOSEALL()


So if i create a database and use the rest of the sample it should work?

Richard , show  the command that you have used to compile your sample

I think this is your problem

2 questions :

in who Operating systema you are working ?

and

IN another way , do you check if hbmysql is created when you have compiled
SVN ?

or you have downloaded a binary version of Harbour ?

Not my sample, i compiled the provided sample inside my own program.

hbmk2 clientes.prg ing_cli.prg rddsql.lib %hwgui_lib%\hwgui.lib 
%hwgui_lib%\procmisc.lib %hwgui_lib%\hbxml.lib %hwgui_lib%\hwg_qhtm.lib -gui

i changed rddsql <> hbmysql and the sample provided with hbmysql is 
inside ing_cli.prg as it was on provided .prg

I think you should read hbmyslq's readme, where they explain how to

compile to build the libraries.
And also you should compile harbour with mysql support, please read
install file in harbour directory.

  To do that  you need to have some libraries of your myslq to harbour
use it to build the accessing libraries to your mysql version.

Then you must include the generated libraries to hbp that compile your
applicattion

I'm still do not try rrdsql but it has a sample on how to access to
mysql (sddmy), but I think you also need the previous libraries.

Hope helps you

Maurizio

Richard , you need to install Mysql Devel Libraries , you need to check if
your version of mysql include it , if i am not wrong an Mysql.h include and
something more

You need include folder and point harbour to it

AS Maurizio say , read INSTALL txt file in harbour root , and readme of
hbmysql

If you try to use sddmy think that you need to commit using SQL .

Now i recompiled harbour SVN with mysql dev installed and DID'NT 
compiled hbmysql.lib, so AGAIN i had to compile it separately, BUT NOW 
it does not compile.
So, i had a compiled and apparently ok lib, but now i don't have the lib 
and cant compile it again.
I don't even understand the error...

I guess this means hbmysql is referencing something that is suppossed to 
come in another library.
how can i know wich library to add?

thanks.

trying to use rddmysql i have found that there (seems to be) is no 
activity, but neither are any error coming from test app as if mysql 
connector were not installed.

So i guess, is it possible that i need a particular version of ODBC 
mysql connector?
It cames to me because a friend of mine who programs on visualbasic uses 
mysql connector 3.5 instead of 5.1 as i installed to make my attempts.

?any thoughts?

Do you have installed Mysql-Devel ?

You need includes from Mysql , some installers of mysql server not include
this files

I installed mysql complete...

The problem ended being some sort of missdirection when making implib 
libmysql.dll.

I did it separately and worked fine, now the application compiles and 
everything that was not working runs flawless.
(4L coca-cola and about 20 mint candys later)

I finally achieved to talk to the server and received the answers.
