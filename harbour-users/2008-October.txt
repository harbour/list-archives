Hi all,

Where do I find installation documentation?

I downloaded /harbour-1.0.1.tar.gz, untarred it into a directory, switched to 
the harbour-1.0.1 directory. I saw no INSTALL or README file, couldn't find 
any installation docs on the Harbour website, so I ran ./make_gcc.sh.

Then I switched to harbour-1.0.1/bin/gcc, created a hello world program, and 
this as the result:

[slitt@mydesk gcc]$ ./hbrun ~/hello.prg
   
Hello world!                                                                                                                                   
[slitt@mydesk gcc]$

So far so good. But when I did this:

./hbrun ~/hello.prg

and then compiled the resulting hello.c:

[slitt@mydesk gcc]$ gcc hello.c
hello.c:7:21: error: hbvmpub.h: No such file or directory
hello.c:8:20: error: hbinit.h: No such file or directory
hello.c:11: warning: data definition has no type or storage class

And then a whole bunch of errors. It doesn't surprise me, as I didn't do the 
equivalent of make install, but I don't know how to do that. I 
ran /harbour/harbour-1.0.1/bin/postinst.sh, but it told me I had to set 
several environment variables, and I decided not knowing what I was doing 
wasn't a good idea.

Anyone know where I can find documentation on installation?

Thanks

SteveT

Thanks Adam, but I can't read Polish, and I'd prefer to compile it myself 
rather than use RPMs which probably don't match my exact distro.

I'm uploading script to make all, just execute it in your local home
directory. Remember NOT to do it as root, but DO it as normal user.
This script gets all harbour sources and makes rpms for your
distribution.
Some info in english you will find at:

Thanks Adam! Where can I download the script?

Thanks. That was a clear explanation, but unfortunately many of the programs 
that page mentions aren't in my Harbour distribution: 

[slitt@mydesk harbour-1.0.1]$ ls -l bin/gcc/*
-rwxr-xr-x 1 slitt slitt  568204 2008-10-02 18:12 bin/gcc/harbour*

-rw-r--r-- 1 slitt slitt     867 2008-10-03 13:47 bin/gcc/hello.ppo

bin/gcc/htm:
total 0
[slitt@mydesk harbour-1.0.1]$


I made hello.c by using harbour on hello.prg, and I'm not sure how I made 
hello.ppo.

I couldn't find any equivalent to the hbcc and hbmake mentioned in your web 
page.

Thanks
