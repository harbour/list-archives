Message-ID: <mailman.0.1236235024.3346.harbour-users@harbour-project.org>

Hello, 
 
I am trying to get serial commincations working.  
 
I have an older version of xharbour with xhbcomm.  I bought xharbour becase
it has serial support.  After paying for it, I was told  that the particular
library that I need, xhbcomm, is not source code available, without
explanation.  I suppose that this is because it not open source licensed.
This means that without source code, I cannot upgrade.  
 
I have tried to use the hbcomm.lib, but it always crashed with an "abnormal
program termination" message.  According to a previous post, this is because
my input parameters are incorrect.  I have tried different parameters, but
it still crashes.  
 
Next, I tried telepathy, but it appears to support Linux and OS/2, not
Windows32.  
 
Now I am trying testprt1.prg in contrib/hbwin.  I have two computers connect
via null modem cable.  The owinport:write method seems to work, but
oWinport:read does not.  
 
Any suggestions greatly appreciated, thanks, mattfriend88

hbtpathy doesn't have a complete implementation
for Windows. There is however a comm subsystem
for Windows in hbwin.lib. See testprt1.prg and testprt2.prg
for example code.

Here is used read command and seem works

#include "hbwin.ch"

procedure main(cPortName)

    local oWinPort := WinPort():Init(cPortName, CBR_9600, NOPARITY, 8,
ONESTOPBIT)
    local cString := "ATE0" + chr(13) + "ATI3" + chr(13)
    local nResult

    if !oWinPort:Open
        ? "Open() failed :", oWinPort:Error()
    else
        ? "Open() succeeded"
        ?
        if oWinPort:SetDTR(.t.)
            ? "SetDTR(.t.) succeeded"
        else
            ? "SetDTR(.t.) failed :", oWinPort:Error()
        endif
        if (nResult := oWinPort:Write(cString)) == len(cString)
            ? "Write() succeeded"
        else
            ? "Write() failed, returned ", nResult, " expected ", len(cString)
        endif
        ? "Scan something... we'll not read it but purge it, press enter"
        inkey(0)
        ? "Read() ", oWinPort:Read(@cString, 32), len(cString), cString
        ? oWinPort:Error()
        ? "Close", oWinPort:Close()
    endif

return

I am using Linux/Fedora, and I installed Harbor compiler to test,...

It works great,... but I cannot figure out how to connect to MySql,...

Where could I find a command's list, syntaxes or  just same examples?

Thanks you very much.

Is there any built in functionality in Harbour to get browse capability (like dbu)?  This sort of code works in FlagShip and elsewhere:

use tempdbf
browse()               && browse here

Thanks.

Subject: [Harbour-users] compile error latest svn 
Message-ID: <49C8DB5A.3090709@tiscalinet.it>

I tried to compile the svn version but I get an error at early stage.
I have BCC 5.5.1, win XP pro. I get the message: unresolved external 
_hb_snprintf referenced from 
v:\harbour-svn\harbour\lib\b32\hbcommon.lib|hbver.
First I downloaded the SVN files, only to discover there were many 
missing. So i added the missing files from the 1.0.1 directory tree. Is 
this correct?
I use the version 0.99 without problems, and the 1.0.1 too seems to work 
well.
Any help would be appreciated.
TIA
