Hi,

I have downloaded the installer, but it gives me an error when I try to
install. What's wrong? The message is:
"Installer integrity check has failed. Common causes include incompleted
download or damaged media. Contact the installer's author to obtain a new
copy."

I have downloaded twice, but the error persists.

Regards and a Happy New Year.

I may try to build rpms for openSuse... I should have 3 or 4 opensuse
versions available to build harbour on...

I need to ask a question: if I install the mysql client and build
harbour to activate mysql integration, the user that install that rpm
must also have the mysql client installed ?????

I ask this because from what I understand, rpm building is now
"monolithic", there is one rpm with all the stuff, mandatory or
optional.
So to be useful to everybody I should build a rpm with all the options
included (mysql, ads...) But I imagine that for the users, to have
these options working, they should also have the "clients" installed
so I should set the "clients" as pre-requisites... but with these
requirements I force everybody to install mysql client, ads client
etc.
Or better, I may build with every option set, but with no dependencies
at all .... but if the client installation is required I will give the
users the idea that mysql integration is available while it is not ...

Another option would be to have the packages split: the first one,
monolithic, is the "base" package, the "mandatory" one. All the
optional packages have the "base" package as pre-requisite and each
one has its own "client" pre-requistite... a bit like the php
packaging... So every user may install the base package and the
install only the optional that he needs....

Let me know your idea,
Francesco

it's quite obvious that this is the long-term way to go :)

i have a mail cooking for quite some time, primarily as some kind of 
feedback to viktor's oft-asked question as to make harbour 
packaging-friendly, but the whole splitting- and packaging-idea raises 
so many questions and problems that thus far i've never had the 
inspiration to sit tight long enough to organize my thoughts and 
actually write the mail. maybe my unconscious is thinking if i wait 
long enough, it writes itself :)

It should work like this already. Except there are 
a few things to fix: Allegro, Cairo and Freeimage 
dependent contribs aren't created in separate rpms, 
plus OpenSSL dependency isn't set when Harbour is 
build with OpenSSL option.

I'll commit something, but I'm not expert in RPM 
and don't have an opportunity to test, so I'd like 
to ask RPM users to test and further patch it.

Brgds,
Viktor

I'll only add a new user if we delete some other ones.

It's _insane_ to have all our messages indexed in 5 
different copies on the internet... Makes searching 
_much more_ difficult due to unnecessary double hits, 
with no reasonable way to filter. Only way is to click 
on each hit and realized they are copies; annoying, 
time-consuming.

So until we clear this up, I won't add any new replicator 
services.

We already have:
 - Our own mailman archives (matrixlist), 
 - gmane.org
 - mail-archive.com
 - nabble.com

All of them indexed by google.

+ Since this is a mailing list, the online and/or 
offline mailer search facilities can be used (gmail 
and Mail.app in my case), plus local search facilities 
on almost all existing OSes.

Brgds,
Viktor

We've been hopping mailing list providers in the beginning 
(mostly because of host company takeovers and mergers), so 
the early days are only available from local/offline mail 
archives. (f.e. I have 37247 messages from 1999.04-2002.02 
period - in .emlx format and not really ready for publishing 
since I can't be sure if it's all public messages.)

From the point when Phil provides us the mailing list, 
maybe it would be nice to publish all archives on the 
archives page. You should ask Phil if that's possible.

Brgds,
Viktor

you can limit your searches on Google with site:

site:matrixlist.com blah search blah

That will force Google to return hits only from that site.

Google should have them. Use the Google site: command to limit the
search.

After many tests with postgresql, mysql, pdf, rtf, xls it seems that
ITWIN is the best solution also for Linux/OSX.

Euro sign is shown correctly at 0x80 even in an html page with
encoding="ISO-8859-1".
In mysql 5.0 latin1 is indeed cp1252 and in oocalc Windows
1252/WinLatin1 is the only encoding I found that shows the dbfs
correctly. Not to mention that it makes easy to share data between
gtxwc and win/gtwvt apps.

So I plan to move from:

   REQUEST HB_CODEPAGE_ITISB
   HB_SETCODEPAGE( "ITISB" )
   HB_SETTERMCP( "ITISB", "ITISB", TRUE )

to

   REQUEST HB_CODEPAGE_ITWIN
   SET( _SET_CODEPAGE, "ITWIN" )
   HB_SETTERMCP( "ITWIN", "ITWIN", TRUE )

for all my platforms.

Am I missing anything?

Thank you, I will try to build the rpm later today.

Are these changed backported on the 2.0 branch ? Or I export the 2.0,
the tip and manually copy from tip to 2.0 ?
I'm not a svn user... (I usually use mercurial)

That's true, although I still fail to see why is it 
good for us to force this to all users who want to 
get relevant search hits for Harbour messages.

These changes are only present in trunk. You may 
try to copy them to 2.0.0, but I'd strongly 
suggest to make tests in SVN version, to be on 
common ground.

This page supposes to have all messages from 2000.09 - 2004.09 in .mbox format:

http://web.archive.org/web/20041011215318/http://www.matrixlist.com/pipermail/harbour/

However, the .mbox file is broken and the .gz files were not archived.

2006.05 - 2006.10 is completely missing, even as .gz links.

Prezmek,

I was curious how the original version of this seems to have disapeared and 
it seems that when you started modifying gt, you either used whatever 
version you started with and ignored further updates that were made to the 
code, or you actively excluded this code because you didn't know why it was 
there. (not sure).

The other piece that I see is missing is that during a SetMode() change, the 
'correct' way was to make sure that no dispbegin() was in effect before 
updating the console.  (Definately Clipper compatible).  I simply can't look 
into whether this will be an issue or not, but I wrote the code once, so 
it's still around if you need it.

As for xHarbour, someone just blindly accepted your change as 'the way' and 
replaced the xharbour driver.

I have wrote a little howto (but i need to verify it to solve your question):

Please try this http://www.elart.it/links/harbourhowto_deb_en.php
here in italian lang  http://www.elart.it/links/harbourhowto_deb.php

Please also put this link in your bookmark to have the main develop
site of Ubuntu where you can ask questions and submit Ubuntu bugs and
generally find help: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu

I have made a packaging request here:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/502331 please subcribe yourself
to launchpad and subcribe the bug (packaging request)

Please also try my mb-ubuntu-optimizer (write in harbour) that auto
optimize firefox and give terminal command to optimize Ubuntu

the deb heuristics are quite wrong (works on latest ubuntu, but 
that's about it. maybe one version back as well.). you should rather 
check for the existence of /etc/debian_version, that's a much better 
sign of dpkg being the native package manager.

Sure i will do but is better to enforce the Ubuntu packaging request i
reported here
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/harbour/+bug/502331
on Launchpad or better create a PPA
https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA for Harbour.
to get Harbour easily installed and updated from repositories, while
we are waiting for the official inclusion into master repositories.

Can we try to do it ?

Hope this helps

  * config/global.mk
    % Applied little optimization from Tamas Tevesz.

  * contrib/hbide/idemisc.prg
    + hbide_PathProc()
      This function can combine relative paths together so it's
      the key to avoid macros dealing with placing paths to their
      intended location. It can replace current method of
      <IdeSrc> = hb_dirBase(). F.e.:
          hbide_PathProc( "src/mysource_in_project.prg", "projects_dir/" ) ->
                  "projects_dir/src/mysource_in_project.prg"
          hbide_PathProc( "projects/myproject.hbi", hb_dirBase() ) ->
                  "C:/harbour/contrib/hbide/projects/myproject.hbi"
      Please use it.

    ; TOFIX: Since hbide seems to intend to support a hbrun-like
             command prompt, maybe it's a good idea to prefix all
             public functions with hbide_, otherwise there will
             be problems when name collision occurs with user code.
             If this is not the goal, we can leave it.

Hi!

Great! I'm making huge HBIDE implementations in which I post within a
few hours. Nearly every item from the File menu will be ready soon.
But I need much know how to enable DEBUG in the HBIDE to find some
memory problems that are occurring, how do I see the result of
HBXBP_DEBUG ()?

Vailton Renato

I'm testing rpm builds on openSuse...

it seems that -static- rpm must be installed... is it mandatory ? if
yes, should it be included in the standard package ?

pls read my comments (now forwarded to the list), I'd also 
like to get comments from others on this solution, as it 
looks a little problematic to me. Besides some implementation 
details, I don't understand why storing an array of thread 
ID/lasterror pairs into _every_ Harbour thread is useful.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hello to all,
 
I found strange behaviour when I build harbour from SVN in windows enviromet.
 
When HB_WITH_GD is not set, then the logfile generated by win-make.EXE contains row
 
! 'hbgd' library skipped ('libgd' not found. Configure with HB_WITH_GD.)
 
informing about missing setting for the libgd. OK.
 
When HB_WITH_GD is set, there is no line in the logfile informing me about the presence of the 'libgd'.
 
Why ? 
 
The presence or not presence of  'openssl' or 'QT' is logged allways.
 
Regards
Jaro

I set ACE client include dir , and libhbads is created , but not libace32.a
it is correct ?

it is needed this library in linux ?

In this case , how do you think is the problem ?

OpenSSL is a global dependency, not tied to a specific lib, 
just like the rest of dependencies (crs, sln) you can always see 
a build startup. Detection is displayed because it's otherwise 
difficult to find out from logs if the detection was successful.
Originally I didn't plan to leave these there, but they turned 
out to be useful so I kept them.

You can never see an explicit message about successful detection 
for the rest though, because in these cases you can see a clear proof 
of successful detection anyway: The dependent lib (in this case 
hbgd) _is getting built_. Adding extra messages would just clutter 
the output with redundant information. [ the other reason is that 

As for QT you can only see a line for MOC tool detection, otherwise 
it behaves consistently with gd and the rest.

To sum it up: Everything works as designed.

Brgds,
Viktor

No. 

libace32.a is a Windows specific import lib created by HB_BUILD_IMPLIB option.

It has nothing to do with mainstream build process or any *nix systems.

Seems perfect. I am looking into how it can be encapsulated in meta-data 
automatically, unless Vailton has not done it already.

No, it looks fine. It can even be a little bit further optimized, 
I'll commit it ASAP, pls test it.

Just a general note: It would be nice to see in your 
change descriptions what is actually fixed. I mean what 
was the observed error before the fix.

Now I can't even test it, as it always worked for me 
even so far, don't know how to verify the improvement.

But this way the text of the message is misleading.
IMO it should only be displayed if there _are_ unreleased blocks.
Saying "Warning, memory allocated but not released: 0 blocks" looks 
like a display bug.

IMO it was good as it was, or I'm missing something.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Viktor,

It is a summary of a long way hunting/debugging, so these short
sentences/fragments are not adequate to describe the fix. But, as I see this
is an usual way for fixing, without so much details.

Please test it in MinGW environment, should fix some errors mainly in object
handlings regarding the Heap managements.

Best regards,
Istv?n

I'd like to kindly ask you to elaborate more.

I think it's rather the opposite in ChangeLog than 
what you observed, but of course if there is lacking 
text, pls inform the list, and we shall correct it.

ChangeLog is the most important place to document 
changes along with the reasoning.

I expect ppl to know what I'm changing, and I 
expect users to test my changes, which is usually 
impossible without knowing what to test.

> Please test it in MinGW environment, should fix some errors mainly in object
> handlings regarding the Heap managements.

Since I still don't know what to test, I can't 
help here. For me everything worked without any 
visible problems, so it would be quite blind 
run to test for enhancements.

How about the other change?

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Viktor,

> I'd like to kindly ask you to elaborate more.

With the previous, default build, way of the Heap managements, the HVM for
MinGW tried to replace the CRT functions with its own malloc, free, etc. 
This is a completely wrong solution in this context, is too weak.

> How about the other change?

----------------------------------------
Total memory allocated: 2251241 bytes (29215 block(s))
Warning, memory allocated but not released: 0 bytes (0 block(s))

It is the message (with HB_USER_CFLAGS=-DHB_FM_STATISTICS), when the all
allocated blocks are released perfectly, if it is not adequate please change
it.

Note: Is the ending message now for hbide and demoxbp.

Best regards,
Istv?n

I hope Przemek can comment on it. I still can't 
see the real reason here. We do it for some compilers 
and we don't do it for others. For MSVC, without 
this trick it gave memory errors on exit so it was 
clearly apparent. Maybe MinGW was the same, but it 
didn't report it?

Currently above msg will also appear when not compiled 
with fmstat. I'll commit a fix.

There are still two HBQT TOFIXes where leak is only prevented 
by explicit .prg calls.

Plus we're not using the official C++ allocation override 
for HBQT yet, which may be a problem. What do you think?

Viktor

I hope Przemek can comment on it. I still can't 
see the real reason here. We do it for some compilers 
and we don't do it for others. For MSVC, without 
this trick it gave memory errors on exit so it was 
clearly apparent. Maybe MinGW was the same, but it 
didn't report it?

Currently above msg will also appear when not compiled 
with fmstat. I'll commit a fix.

There are still two HBQT TOFIXes where leak is only prevented 
by explicit .prg calls.

Plus we're not using the official C++ allocation override 
for HBQT yet, which may be a problem. What do you think?

You're testing HBQT unreleased memory as reported by 
our memory manager, but C++ mode isn't currently fully 
(or at all?) setup to use our own memory allocation 
functions.

Here is the complete set which needs to be overridden 
as per QT documentation:

---
#include "hbapi.h"

void * operator new[]( size_t size )
{
   return hb_xgrab( size );
}

void * operator new( size_t size )
{
   return hb_xgrab( size );
}

void operator delete[]( void * ptr )
{
   hb_xfree( ptr );
}

void operator delete[]( void * ptr, size_t )
{
   hb_xfree( ptr );
}

void operator delete( void * ptr )
{
   hb_xfree( ptr );
}

void operator delete( void * ptr, size_t )
{
   hb_xfree( ptr );
}
---

I've committed it to fm.c.

Brgds,
Viktor

So, let's print a single line joined message:

Total memory allocated: 2251241 bytes (29215 block(s)), not released: 0 
bytes (0 block(s))

if these zeros are important, otherwise message looks redundant.

OK, these are just the global operator redefinitions, does not affect the Qt
interface deletes. We can comment them.

Hi Mindaugas,

Yes, the zeroes are important, but Viktor redefines these printout to a more
precise ones.

In fact the whole point of previous implementation was
that we warn developers if there _is_ a leak, and stay 
silent if there isn't. This way it's apparent when there 
is a problem and when not. If we wash together the 
two messages, it will be less easy to spot if there is 
a problem. I can imagine a 'zero' value could be useful 
for testers to see there _was_ testing/measurement done, 
yet the result is zero. Probably that's the reason Istvan 
added it.

An interesting task would be to find out a method to 
ensure that only Harbour memory allocation functions 
were used throughout the whole app (even C++ allocators), 
otherwise we may get into false impressions.

Brgds,
Viktor

I've added the rest anyway.

What is the way to force our allocation functions to be 
used by QT C++ new/delete operators?

Without this, any fm.c leak measurement is pointless 
for QT subsystem, as our fmstat modules is just not used 
at all by it.

Viktor

An another way is to use the Placement New/Delete mechanism on the

Is a complete new area, with a lot of experimenting /testing issues.

    + Added new implementation of slots and events.
      This fixes potential leaks in old implementation by
      moving HB_EVENTS, HB_SLOTS low level per-thread
      structures to .prg level and adding proper GC destructors
      to them.
      To use the new interface in .prg level code, following changes
      will have to be applied:
        1. Adding new :events, :slots holder variables to .prg level.
        2. Init these holder variables with QT_EVENTS_NEW() and QT_SLOTS_NEW().
        3. Make these conversions:
            QT_CONNECT_EVENT( ... )     -> QT_EVENTS_CONNECT( p, ... )
            QT_DISCONNECT_EVENT( ... )  -> QT_EVENTS_DISCONNECT( p, ... )
            QT_CONNECT_SIGNAL( ... )    -> QT_SLOTS_CONNECT( p, ... )
            QT_DISCONNECT_SIGNAL( ... ) -> QT_SLOTS_DISCONNECT( p, ... )
            QT_GETEVENTFILTER()         -> QT_EVENTS_PTR( p ) (there is a TOFIX here for the future)
        4. Delete these calls:

Sure. I am at the fag-end of implementation of themes in HBIDE
which I hope to finish in few hours. Then I will review these changes.

1) hbcplr in "static"
I installed all the requirements (except ADS) and built the rpm.

I installed the "lib" and the "base" package. If I try to compile a
simple test program I get:
# hbmk2 test.prg -trace

hbcplr is not present in /usr/lib/harbour... it is in the "static" package...

So I tried to compile -fullshared and -fixshared but I got the same error...


So I installed the "static" rpm and
hbmk2 test.prg
compiled...

I then tried to compile statically
hbmk2 test.prg -fullstatic
but I got
hbmk2 test.prg -fullstatic

2) pcre
pcre.... during compilation I get:
! Component: 'pcre' found in /usr/include
and some lines later
! 'libpng' library skipped (unused)
! 'hbpcre' library skipped (unused)
! 'hbzlib' library skipped (unused)


can't understand what happens.... well, I have the .so shared
libraries installed and I probably don't have the static linkable ones
but pcre is included in source form.... should I force using the
internal pcre at compile time ????

Hi,

I guess these problems are all rooted in the fact 
that .rpm was generated using overridden HB_*_INSTALL 
parameters. hbmk2 only support standard installations 
by default. You can either try using a standard dir 
layout when building Harbour, or forcing unique dir 
layour by using HB_*_INSTALL envvars at hbmk2 time.
I suggest the first option, by simply dropping 
HB_*_INSTALL override at build-time.

[ For some reason ppl still like to define these, 
despite dozens of e-mails recommending otherwise. ]

> hbcplr is not present in /usr/lib/harbour... it is in the "static" package...

Sorry, I don't know what is 'static package'.

If hbcplr isn't in /usr/lib/harbour, it's a sign 
of non-standard dir layout usage described above.

As for pcre: What happens is that embedded sources 
are not used on platforms where these components are 
made available by the system. You can force locally 
hosted version, but I suggest to accept these defaults.

Brgds,
Viktor

I suggest you to start over, and if you still have problems, 
pls publish your build log so we can see what exactly happened 
and what settings were used.

Hi!

I finished drafting the codes for the hbIDE and would like to send to
Pritpal for analysis, a brief summary of the changes that I made:

IsValidText() some more valid extensions added

editSource() message appears if the file open is not supported.

loadIni()
   implemented support for RecentFiles & RECENTPROJECTS sections.
   Optimized support for section names regardless of case used.
   Enhanced with SWITCH instead of CASE.
   Optimized initialization oide:Aini regardless of the amount
expected items in the file. INI
   Implemented a basic validation to ignore invalid sections in the file. INI

* I drew a few new icons for the menu of the application.

FILE > recent files -> implementation done.

FILE > recent projects -> implementation done.

FILE > SAVE AND EXIT -> implementation done.

FILE > OPEN - supports opening multiple files

FILE > REVERT -> implementation done.

findEditByFileName() - new method to Find an item in aEdits[] based on
the file name passed as argument.

findEditByID() - new method to Find an item in aEdits[] based on the
ID passed as argument.

HbIde:closeAllSources() implementation done.

HbIde:closeSource() rewritten to support the closeAllSources() method

HbIde:closeAllOther() -> implementation done.

HbIde:saveSourceAs() -> implementation done.

HbIde:updateTitleBar() - New method to updates the title bar of the
main window, indicating the project and the current filename.

HELP > About - implementation done.
HELP > Harbour on line - implementation done.
HELP > HB Users Mailing  - implementation done.
HELP > HB Developers Mailing  - implementation done.

EDIT menu items were attached to the existing options in ::executeAction()

IdeFindReplace:show() -> Detect if current edit has any selected text.

Something is not right because when I click the close button to close
the main window and he asks me if I want to save the files and when I
click CANCEL it has to abort the process and not close the system as
it is occurring.

hbide now displays the text "Untitled XX" on creating a new file.

Fixed in hbxbp method that ignored the list of filters defined.

[code]
METHOD XbpFileDialog:saveAs( cDefaultFile, lFileList, lCenter )
   LOCAL nResult, oList, i

   DEFAULT lFileList    TO .T.
   DEFAULT cDefaultExt  TO ''

   IF !( hb_isLogical( lCenter ) )
      lCenter := ::center
   ENDIF

   ::oWidget:setAcceptMode( QFileDialog_AcceptSave )

   IF !empty( ::defExtension )
      ::oWidget:setDefaultSuffix( ::defExtension )
   ENDIF

   IF hb_isChar( ::title )
      ::oWidget:setWindowTitle( ::title )
   ENDIF

   IF hb_isChar( cDefaultFile )
      ::oWidget:setDirectory( cDefaultFile )
   ENDIF

   IF empty( ::fileFilters )
      ::oWidget:setNameFilter( "All File (*.*)" )
   ELSE
      IF len( ::fileFilters ) == 1
         ::oWidget:setNameFilter( Xbp_ArrayToFileFilter( ::fileFilters[ 1 ] ) )
      ELSE
         oList := QStringList():new()
         FOR i := 1 TO len( ::fileFilters )
            oList:append( Xbp_ArrayToFileFilter( ::fileFilters[ i ] ) )
         NEXT
         ::oWidget:setNameFilters( oList )
      ENDIF
   ENDIF

//   oStyle := QApplication():style()
//   ::oWidget:setStyle( oStyle )
   ::setStyle()

   IF !( lCenter )
      ::setPos()
   ENDIF
   nResult := ::oWidget:exec()

   RETURN IF( nResult == QDialog_Accepted, ::extractFileNames(), NIL )
[/code]

Unfortunately I lacked the time to merge these changes with the Viktor
sent to the list today. In my opinion, to the main menu items are
completed missing very little. I waiting for comments and suggestions
and hope that these changes may be helpful.

    ! Changed the way .ppo is presented. Now a new modeless 
      window displays .ppo source and thus you have more control
      over comaprison with original source. You can keep as many
      such .ppo windows on the screen.

    + Implemented Editor Themes.
      HBIDE provides 5 default themes, along the lines of xMate, viz., 
         1. Classic
         2. City Lights
         3. Evening Glamour 
         4. Sand Storm
      with a few changes, and
         5. Pritpal's Favourite.

      Themes interface provides for changing the existing themes
      as well as constructing a new one based on any exiting themes.
      Then user can save them in hbide.hbt file.

      HBIDE always loads default 5 themes as above then, 
      HBIDE looks for hbide.hbt in the same folder where it is.
      If it finds one, it attempts to load it.  In the loading 
      process it will merge the duplicate themes, including the 
      default ones. It means, if you modify an existing default
      theme and then save it in hbide.hbt, at next invocation
      default theme will be overwritten and your changes are 
      reflected. But if the name of the theme is changed you have 
      yours plus default both themes available.

      Default theme is "Pritpal's Favourite" which will be applied
      to any source file opened. You can override it by applying 
      new theme to it. Right click on <Editors Tree><_any_source_file_>
      and select "Apply Theme" and finally select from a list of 
      themes presented in a list box by double clicking onto one
      of choice. Next time you open HBIDE thus souce will be 
      applied the last theme selected.

      You can re-define various labels on the Themes Dialog including
      drop-down list items of different parts of the sources.
      Just examine hbide.hbt and change the values of dialog elements.

      Differences from xMate implementation:
         1. Theme can be applied to indivisual source separately.
         2. Theme elements can have <Italic>, <Bold> and <Underline>
            attributes.
         3. Themes can be copied and re-defined for n numbers.

      TODO: To apply themes per project.
            To implement some missing parts of source, such as, 
               background color of selections, etc.

      You are encouraged to test this implementation. I will be 
      more than happy to implement descent thoughts you can imagine.

Subject: [Harbour] help with a fatal runtime error
Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP13C470E1410792F9EC913FEF750@phx.gbl>

I've been expanding the test case program for contrib\hbbtree and I've 
encountered a nasty runtime error.

This is the runtime error message - no other message / callstack / trace 
back is shown:
    This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an 
unusual way.
    Please contact the application's support team for more information.

I google'd for it, found a Microsoft knowledge base article (about a 
problem with msvcrt.dll) and I installed the hotfix, but this did not 
resolve the problem; given that the KB article is about a MSVC 
environment I knew it was a long shot.

A self contained test program basically creates a new btree, inserts a 
single record and closes the btree.

If the btree is file-based there is no runtime error but that is because 
it is using an internal long variable not an HB_ITEM.

If the btree is memory-based, the runtime error occurs under one 
circumstance:
    - the data value inserted is a number, and
    - there is _no_ print statement between the insert and the close; to 
clarify:
            create
            insert
            close

If the data value is a string the runtime error does not occur, or if 
there _is_ a print statement; to clarify:
            create
            insert
            print
            close

By liberally filling my code with a simple logging method I've 
discovered that the runtime error is from the release of the item.

The item history is (from the various parts of the code that create, 
store, and delete item):
    // parameter #3 must be a long for file-based and any for memory-based
    hb_retl( hb_BTreeInsert( pBTree, hb_parc( 2 ), hb_paramError( 3 ) ) );

    // the above parameter is pData; here is being assigned to the btree 
item
    pBTree->pThisKeyData->xData.pData = hb_itemNew( pData );

    // when the btree is being closed, all items are released; this is 
the source of the failure
    hb_itemRelease( thisptr->xData.ppData[ n ] );

Because the problem goes away with the inclusion of a print statement or 
the use of a string data I'd suspect that garbage collection has 
occurred but I do not know how that affects this.

I thought my internal link list was faulty but my research says 
otherwise; I thought I was trying to release an item twice but my 
research says otherwise.

I hope someone can point me to a possible cause.

April

testwmtx.prg is an example of why not work wapi_GetLastError() .-

--- testwmtx.prg
STATIC s_hMutex

PROCEDURE Main()
    LOCAL cAppName

    // It may be a random program name :)
    hb_FNameSplit( hb_ProgName(), NIL, @cAppName )

    s_hMutex := wapi_CreateMutex( NIL, NIL, cAppName )
    IF ! Empty( s_hMutex ) .AND. wapi_GetLastError() == 0
       ? cAppName, "=> Hello World! OK."
    ELSE
       ? cAppName, "=> Application is running. Error", wapi_GetLastError()
    ENDIF

    WAIT

    RETURN
---

In the second instance of the application fails because wapi_GetLastError() return 0.
Compiling in MT mode, not define HB_USE_TLS and in Windows of course.

_*WHAY*_
wapi_CreateMutex() call CreateMutex() Windows API function.
CreateMutex() set the last error code to 183 ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS (Is Ok the mutex already exit in the second instance).
But wapi_CreateMutex() return with hb_ret* and this functions call hb_xgrab().
hb_xgrab() and MT mode call hb_mspace() and this call hb_stackAllocator().
hb_stackAllocator() call hb_stack_ready().
hb_stack_ready() call hb_tls_get() and hb_tls_get() is defined with TlsGetValue().

Windows API function TlsGetValue() in Header Winbase.h
How to work with TlsGetValue() .-

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686812%28VS.85%29.aspx

"
The TlsGetValue function calls SetLastError to clear a thread's last error when it succeeds.
"

TlsGetValue() set the last error code to 0 that is returned by wapi_GetLastError().
Not Ok, the Application is running.

IMHO this is irrelevant, I don't like to limit Harbour internal to NOT WORK with Windows APIs.
So I tried to update the repository with an implementation that supports in wapi_* for Windows API Last Error codes and plans to 
update (pre-alloc the memory) without success.

Please, grant access to ID jarabal in sourceforge.net to update the repository.
Thanks. :)

Message-ID: <4B403240.6040307@mail.udg.mx>

I am trying Harbour 2.0.0 (13372) with Qt 4.5.1 on OS/2, beta 5

It use os2gcc 3.3.5 in OMF type libraries

Setting:
  set HB_WITH_QT=E:\Qt451B5\include

First try:
  Skip contrib\hbqt in OS/2 as not supported

Second try: Enable contrib\hbqt in OS/2
  Changing in contrib\hbqt\detect.mk
   #DAVID: _DET_FLT_PLAT := !dos !os2
   _DET_FLT_PLAT := !dos
  It request HB_QT_MOC_BIN

Third try: Enable HB_QT_MOC_BIN
  set HB_QT_MOC_BIN=e:\qt451b5\bin
  It build some files and fail with hbqt_hbdbfmodel.cpp

It seems hb_itemGetL() is typecasted as 'BOOL' instead of 'bool'.
Viktor, can you check ?

There is no cast here:
         vv = hb_itemGetL( ret );

I'm unsure of the fix.

Demoqt runs fine. We need to add one more line
just before Qt_Events_connect() as

oWnd:installEventFilter( s_events )

But I am unable to receive events for hbxbp.
Slots seems to be working ok but events are not 
being populated. I am digging deep anyhow.

For this reason hbide is also stalled.

After building clean I get these errors while linking demoqt:

Generating C source output to 'demoxbp.c'... Done.
C:/harbour_dev/harbour/mingw/lib/libhbqt.a(hbqt_hbslots2.o):hbqt_hbslots2.cpp:(.text+0x0):
multiple definition of `HBSlots::HBSlots(QObject*
)'
C:/harbour_dev/harbour/mingw/lib/libhbqt.a(hbqt_hbslots.o):hbqt_hbslots.cpp:(.text+0x30):
first defined here

The same errors for hbqt_events.

Looking at code I can see that both have same classes defined.
We need to change it in *2 flavour. I do not know why these errors
were not repoted before build clean.

Pritpal Bedi

I will start over later today.

I want just to say that I did not use HB_*_INSTALL overrides when
building rpm...

It is true that I used HB_*_INSTAL in a previous "make; make install"
style compilation that I used to check which files were compiled but
it was in another terminal session....

The RPMs created are:
harbour-2.0.1-devsus112.i586.rpm
harbour-allegro-2.0.1-devsus112.i586.rpm
harbour-cairo-2.0.1-devsus112.i586.rpm
harbour-contrib-2.0.1-devsus112.i586.rpm
harbour-curl-2.0.1-devsus112.i586.rpm
harbour-firebird-2.0.1-devsus112.i586.rpm
harbour-gd-2.0.1-devsus112.i586.rpm
harbour-lib-2.0.1-devsus112.i586.rpm
harbour-mysql-2.0.1-devsus112.i586.rpm
harbour-odbc-2.0.1-devsus112.i586.rpm
harbour-pgsql-2.0.1-devsus112.i586.rpm
harbour-qt-2.0.1-devsus112.i586.rpm
harbour-static-2.0.1-devsus112.i586.rpm


harbour-lib contains the .so libraries
harbour-static contains the .a libraries

It seems that some .a libraries (like hbcplr.a) are needed also for
linking the .so libraries.... I don't know if this is an Harbour
requirement or hbmk2 requirement....

True. I'll try to merge them to fix this.

To me this practice looks rather strange.
Unless there is good reason to split Harbour 
core into main/lib/static packages, IMO they 
should be packaged together. I don't why it 
was implemented this way, and I hope someone 
will clarify.

hbmk2 has no extra requirements over Harbour. 
Its only job is to serve Harbour requirements 
as is. You're right that hbcplr.a may be required 
even when .so is used. This is normal, as the 
compiler (hbcplr) is licensed differently, and not 
part of .so.

This means that to build certain tools (like 
hbrun, hbmk2 itself), both static and dynamic 
libs should be installed.

Brgds,
Viktor

HB_QT_MOC_BIN should be set to the moc binary, 
not the path to the binary.

So it should correctly be:
   set HB_QT_MOC_BIN=e:\qt451b5\bin\moc

you should be checking the library packages instead.

-static means a completely different thing.

-devel packages include files that permit to extend core functionalities...
python-devel: Include Files and Libraries Mandatory for Building Python Modules

I don't agree to have a harbour-devel.. .gcc doesn't have a -devel...
it has a "compiler package" taht includes almost everything...

>From what I understand, harbour-lib MUST be installed on all systems

"core" and "static" are instead for programmers-only... I'd merge
these two because "static" is required anyway if you compile a shared
library !

I agree to merge.

hbmk2 indeed refers to static hbcplr even when not strictly 
required to build the app, it's simply present in lib list.
This is required to present similar behavior in both static 
and dynamic hbmk2 build modes.

The new window. PPO is very cool. Just I do not discovery how to use
the Find / Replace, Goto Line and how view the current cursor position
in this new window and this I felt sorely missed, especially when I'm
comparing the file. PPO with its original.

Yes, I discovered it too. 
Will review this again to get the best of both worlds.
I think now this is the time to rework oEditor in a unified way.

francesco,

honestly this is not intended as an offence, far be from it, but there 
are established standards and policies for packaging, which you are 
not to reinvent, override or outsmart, but to follow.

opensuse has some nice documentation on packaging at 
http://en.opensuse.org/Packaging, especially for the currently 
relevant topic of libraries at 
http://en.opensuse.org/Packaging/Shared_Library_Packaging_Policy

note it says "packaging policy", not "packaging suggestions".

proper packaging is much more complicated and tricky business than 
most of you can even begin to imagine, and it most certainly isn't 
just "lets shovel a metric shitload of files into an rpm (or deb, or 
anything else, for that matter) container and call it a day".

as things stand now, as far as i can tell (this is a long shot, and a 
premature statement from my side, but hey) the upstream build system 
and upstream procedures aren't even able to support proper packaging.

again, do not take this the wrong way, but it really is a much more 
complicated matter than most of you seem to think.

I have a pending commit, which merges core + lib + static 
rpms into one. Is this okay?

We can rename it to anything, although I have to wonder about 
these policies... This policy is OpenSUSE specific. Now if each 
distro has its own policy (and why not, I bet they have), we 
will have some fun waste of time trying to satisfy all of them.

I'm naiv, but I'd think there must exist some RPM / DEB level 
policies which are idealistically in sync with downstream 
distro policies. If there are such policies, first we should 
try to stick to them.

So to sum it up, I propose these priorities when it comes to 
cleanup up our RPM / DEB support:

1. general *nix policies (SUS)
2. general Linux policies (LSB)
3. RPM / DEB packaging level policies
4. distro specific policies

Some contradictions are expected, f.e. LSB doesn't support 
DEB, anyway it's no question we must support it.

What is exactly missing?

Watching the chaos and total _enduser_ unfriendliness 
in the Linux world, I'm a little bit worried now about the 
price to pay to become part of this system. For a start, 
Linux was unable to reach a common packaging method in 
15 years. (No wonder it doesn't catch up on the desktop)
Seems we will be forced to use some tools which will try 
to pull us to become Linux specific, instead of being 
portable/multiplatform. We should try to avoid this.

Worst case we can maintain patches which implement these 
whatever requirements of each distribution we may want to 
support.

Brgds,
Viktor

Follow are my hbide little observation

   - Project tree  have 5 level IMO better merge with something like
   "Project lib" ..a few number of  level to make a minor number of click. and
   better understanding
   - Have collapsed project tree as default (at least first time)  so user
   can easy  find his source
   - File new Project is still complex. Mai be useful create an empty prg
   with "func main and return" Maj be added a option menu create empty project
   - Build and run (f9) must save project like xmate or warning for project
   not saved (instead compile an old version)
   - Xmate have with Ctrl-T the capability to go to function if i click  in
   myfunc() it goto func myfunc in entire project
   - Missing Find in file,Column Mode and also Match pair seem me not work
   - If find in file will return to a grid of object found may me used this
   grid also for show list of  error
   - close a windows with a menu on Right click on tabs (like ctrl-w)
   - Upper,Lower,Invert case icon lost info if made with more that one row
   selected
   - Capability of choice the font for printing
   - Capability add /manage rc
   - File and project menu seem me a little confusing
   - Project embedding explained by  Maurizio seem not implemented
   - In visual theme give possible use ribbon instead menu
   - Option Keyboard mapping of xmate allow define a own script
   i have used for example in script for having an help on line using
   xharbour language reference guide
   I post only for better understanding this bad code that use windows api
   |cTopic|
   IF( Empty( cTopic := ::GetText() ), cTopic := ::GetWord(.F.) ),
   HtmlHelpTopic( ::hWnd, "C:\xHB\Doc\xHarbour Language Reference
   Guide.chm", cTopic )
   Can we use harbour script?
   - Import project file from xmate,makefile of contrib project ,hbp

sorry for repetition and things bad explained,
Still thanks for this effort to Pritpal Bedi & Vailton Renato

HBXBP is also running fine with new protocol.
Just to keep for reference let up retain old proto 
for some time, eventually we will delete them.

Hi Tamas,
I'm not offended since I'm not the original author of the .spec
files... I just wanted to help build the RPMs on Suse (both openSuse
and SLE[D|S]) since I have several running systems at work and at home
that I can use to do such builds.

I was trying to understand how these builds worked and found some
inconsistencies... and I reported them...

> opensuse has some nice documentation on packaging at
> http://en.opensuse.org/Packaging, especially for the currently

> http://en.opensuse.org/Packaging/Shared_Library_Packaging_Policy

I will read them later... but I miss some infos on Harbour internals,
libraries and dependencies.... I can't help too much...

definitely not.

i think that the proper splitting is something very close to this (as 
i'm primarily familiar with deb, that's what i base the following 
upon, but the general principle applies with most every distro, and to 
some extent ports, pkgsrc, and whatever other packaging method there 
is):

harbour-utils - hbrun, maybe hbtest
libharbour$shlib_version - libharbour{mt,}.so.x.y.z
libharbour-dev - *.h, *.api, libharbour{mt,}.so (symlink to &.x.y.z)
harbour - harbour, hbmk2, *.ch, other stuff that are directly used 
  when compiling prg to native code
harbour-doc - stuff in doc/
libharbour-foo - a "foo" component with the foo.so.x.y.z
libharbour-foo-dev - headers for this foo.so.x.y.z, and foo.so (link 
  to foo.so.x.y.z)

of course with carefully crafted dependencies between these, where 
internal dependencies between tools and stuff may further change the 
scene.

as you can see, there is a lot of the above that is not there in the 
build system.

the first problem is a consistent shared library versioning policy. 
currently the so version is stuck to the harbour version number, which 
is suboptimal. it has had the same version number for quite some time, 
with api and maybe abi changes too, this is bad karma. there needs to 
be a procedure stating "if you change abi in an incompatible way, bump 
major; if you change abi in a compatible way, bump minor; if unsure, 
bump", or something along these lines.

this is a strict prerequisite for any libharbour package, which in 
turn is a strict prerequisite for (other, 3rd party) stuff written in 
harbour entering any distro (which i suppose is an implicit goal, 
otherwise there's no point in harbour itself entering any distro).

this only covers libharbour, and does not even begin to scratch the 
stuff that is currently only shipped in static archives. it seems to 
be customary not to make shared versions of these; i haven't yet 
figured out whether this is good or bad (i can reason either case, 
though :).

yes, this detaches libharbour version from the actual harbour version, 
but it also makes it possible (with some extra tweaks i s'pose) to 
have several libharbour versions installed, which is good for example 
if there is a "harbour-2.0" package with the release version, and a 
"harbour-be" (for bleeding edge) version updated regularly, thus 
making it possible for a developer (harbour user, who develops in 
harbour, but who does not develop harbour) to have a stable 
development environment as well as be able to test new features, 
follow new features (maybe in a separate branch in her application), 
and also report bugs with the development version of harbour.

libharbour also needs some baseline functionality. what this means is 
that no matter where, on what system, in what environment, etc etc, is 
a libharbour.so.x.y.z is generated, any other libharbour.so with the 
same x.y.z version generated on any other system in any other 
environment need to have at least a well-defined common ground (call 
it "core functionality"), ideally be the same. what this actually 
means is up for definition (eg. what rdds, what gts, etc etc).

optional (everything the above does not cover) is to be supplied in 
separate {libraries, archives, ...} maybe by libharbour dlopening them 
on demand, or whatever.

consider this: "i have application `foobar', it uses 
libharbour-4.3.11, and it crashes when i look to the left. the 
backtrace says `system has been recalled'". currently basically 
there's no way to tell what actually *is* in libharbour-4.3.11, making 
debugging in email (which *will* happen, when we're there) nigh 
impossible. mix and match this with the currently non-existing 
consistent shlib versions, and it quickly translates to "hm, 
libharbour-4.3.11. we have absolutely no idea what it might be."

then there's the question of packaging the contrib stuff, possibly 
creating packages that support cross-compiling (the picture starts to 
get blurry now -- see, you don't, for example, package gtwvw for a 
native package, but you do for a cross-compile environment).

then there's the question of (again) packaging the contrib stuff - do 
we want a separate package for each (i can reason pro and con against 
either), or do we want to group them by some attributes (i can reason 
pro and con against either) (though my preference is this latter), ...

at this point i literally got tired of citing the issues, as in i 
really need a coffee, but i'm pretty much certain that by now everyone 
sees that it is _rather a complicated issue_.

maybe this is why distros (debian at least) is not really fond of 
upstream doing the packaging :) on the other hand, some debian 
packages tend to be f*ed up beyond all recognition, so downstream 
can't entirely be let on her own either ;)

sus doesn't come to play here (it doesn't really have anything to do 
with packages; if it does, noone uses it anyway, including the branded 
unixes :).

lsb is only a marginal concern; the main point is adhering to fhs, 
which the packaging level policies require anyway.

bullet point #4 will mostly be taken care of by the package building 
procedure itself (eg. do man pages need to be compressed, where to put 
readme.txt, should LICNSE be included, ...).

once the above longer part is ironed out, these four points will 
mostly iron themselves out.

again, this is only of a concern for binary-only packages, or with a 
single unified package for every and all lsb-compliant distro. neither 
is what we are after right now.

it's a lot. but, on one hand, that's what packagers are for. on the 
other hand, there hasn't been an overwhelming storm of volunteers 
(from outside these circles) to create packages for any distro, so i 
guess we are on our own.

chaos is part of the culture. it's revolution, not evolution. this is 
a *statement*, and i'm deliberately not sharing my *opinion* on this 
matter ;)

in principle, it's not a bit different from building a windows 
installer. it's just as $platform-specific, but it's not only one 
platform ("distro"), but many, with a radically different life-, 
evolution-, development- and usage-cycle from that of windows (or os2, 
or even commercial unixen, or even from each other (just compare the 7 
or so years life cycle of rhel with the 6mo fedora releases).

most of the needed things (maybe all of them, save the so version 
thing) doesn't as much need patches as it needs an executive decision: 
"we do it this way". the rest can then be adjusted accordingly. 
obviously, it's best if "our way" is sufficiently close to the 
packaging needs and common sense in order for the adjustments to be 
bearable, but i believe harbour (as in `upstream') can also benefit 
some from the `downstream way', as can downstream benefit from 
upstream.

reiterating again: this is scratching the surface, stating the core 
problems (maybe exaggerating at times, but that is only for 
illustration purposes :), and calling for a discussion. i'm especially 
expecting przemek to chime in, since he seems to be the resident 
rpm-expert as well ;)

I think you are using this incorrectly.

You must call getlasterror before calling anything else that might set or

oh, i see you did that while i was away typing.

anyway, there's no point in reverting that; currently (by virtue of 
rpm/deb being used as a convenience container only), as long as the

I just compiled my version of Harbour 2.0 for UBuntu 9.1

The package works ok , but I see that is diferent the
install path from this package , that from compilation
using SVN and make make install.

This is in linux enviroment


It is ok ?

What is the point of having 'harbour' package, when 
nothing useful can be done with it? In any case, hbmk2 
needs to be moved to utils since it requires libs to 
work.

Then what is the point of having hbrun without dynamic 
libs, when hbrun is built as shared binary in certain 
situations, so it cannot work without Harbour dynamic 
lib also.

I think the ultimate difference between Harbour and 
regular 'lib' packages, is that in Harbour there is 
not much point in having a "dev" packages, as development 
consists of building final apps in 99.99% of cases, 
and not building something else with the help of Harbour 
headers.

harbour compiler executable can do very little thing 
by itself, as far as real-life usage goes.

Here comes to mind, that maybe we should also list 
C compiler tools as dependency, because without C 
compiler, Harbour is again unusable.

We've been in development stage. Version in increased 
by each major release, and we promise to keep compatibility 
between minor releases only. Emphasis on _release_. Current 
SVN, beta, or rc isn't a release.

Yes, shared lib creation for contribs is not implemented 
(yet?).

I'd personally define "get Harbour lib version" as the only 
core functionality which we promise to be compatible across 
all version. I don't see a point in limiting ourselves, as it 
would just effectively halt development and force us to 
concentrate on nothing else, but compatibility.

As for the expected _set of content_, I agree we should have 
a standard defined, and it's defined well already.
It's roughly everything inside /src except compiler. We call 
this "Harbour core". [ The only place this can be violated 
is an extra undocumented build option to mash together core 
dynamic lib with contribs libs, something I've been arguing 
against recently. ]

Above this are contribs, which are independent of each 
other and independent of core, utilizing official Harbour 
APIs only, plus they may have extra external dependencies.

We don't have dynamic versions of these libs.

I'd personally favor a system where standalone (with no
external dependencies) contribs would be packaged inside 
one 'contribs' package, while the rest of them (with 
external dependencies) are packages separately one by one 
to avoid pulling in all the dependencies at once. This 
latter group is often called 'wrappers', 'bindings', but 
it can be more in a few cases, like rddsql.

But, technically there is nothing against packaging 
every contrib separately and this resonates better with 
the notion to look at every contrib as a fully independent 
entity, with to possibility to attach and detach them 
from Harbour SVN.

Probably the cleanest would be this second option.

I guess we could have 'virtual' packages also, which 
would have no other purpose than 'pulling' in all 
contribs, or just contrib without external dependencies, 
or 'popular' libs.

harbour-core
harbour-contribs ("virtual" package)
   harbour-hbct
   harbour-hbtpathy
   harbour-hbmisc
   ...
harbour-bindings ("virtual" package)
   harbour-hbfbird
   harbour-hbodbc
   ...

I meant this not just for packaging, but as a general priority 
when making decision.

FHS, of course, I meant the rest of global standard

Hopefully ;) But as long as we have "OpenSUSE" packaging 
docs around, I don't see a strong guarantee to it.

What if OpenSUSE "requires" to use "-devel" and Red Hat 
doesn't. Until yesterday I expected these policies are 
laid on the package type level.

We have to do it, that's for sure, unless Google

Well, it's a long topic, and if chaos could create 
Linux, it could kill it as well. For now we can only 
decide to support or not support some or all of the 
"standards" and watch things to happen. It stays 
to be a serious problem though which limits adoption 
on Linux. (see long and heated discussion on this 
list form last year, when I complained why I would 
not buy a Linux desktop for my parents or gf.)

If we can keep good separation of distro creation and 
our binary build process, it's good. My fear is that we 
must end up using autoconf/configure/m4 and all that crap 
just to create compliant distros, and become too much Linux 
specific in the process. I meant we should avoid that.
If we can do it, good.

I think we should first try to clean our dir layout.

It will be painful, but beneficiary and it's planned already.

Did you by any chance manually override HB_*_INSTALL variables?

If not, can you tell what the differences are?

No I don' t

in SVN make   install path is /usr/local

and in Ubuntu .deb package  seems to be /usr

When I try ti open the package using Gnome tool Gdebi before install I can
see the files
and here the path is /usr/lib  /usr/include   etc etc

In some moment   I ask  about /usr/local path install , because the standard
in Ubuntu was /usr

but I don't know which is better

I'd guess that /usr/local is the right one.
I hope to see some more educated answers :)

For me it's important that both works correctly.

Howto add Libs to a project ?

or HBIDE autodetect and add it automatically ?

I think that both works ok but may be its better that the path
would be the same in both SVN and .DEB package

Who changes this in harbour project ?

Bruno

PD : thanks for your words I hope too

Hi!

It uses the hbmk2 to build and therefore most common LIBs are already
incorporated at the time of linking.

Anyone can change it, but before we do so, 
it would be good to see why it is setup

/usr should be used only by packages since they know how to clean and
how to manage conflicts.

make install MUST go elsewhere like /usr/local or /opt/<name>

Please let's leave to Linux REAL developers rpm and deb packaging issues.

It's controlled in harbour.spec. Looking at it closely, 
we're simply using default values of RPM creator tool.

Please don't take it personally, what I meant was simply that, as said
in another thread, packaging is a complex issue and here we have
developers like Przemyslaw that really know the best way to do it.

These are vacation days in many countries, let's wait a bit.

Many thanks, I'll do it ASAP.

Reviewing the changes, is there any particular reasons 
for these ones:

naturally there are dependencies between them, also external deps as 
needed.

i might be misunderstanding something, but this seems to be untrue. i 
have a hbrun binary that (to a certain extent) chugs along nicely, 
without any trace of a dynamic libharbour (or anything else harbour) 
being around anywhere.

hbrun's script interpreter mode is the prime example of the contrary. 
also imagine przemek coming up with (arbitrary example) an ads-like 
"dbf server", which relies on and only relies on libhb (file 
management, network management, dbf drivers, full stop). should the 
compiler and headers, and contrib/rddads be installed in this case? 
hardly.

yes, of course. i deliberately didn't go into such details for fear of

ok, i accept that. i still think that bumping as changes go would be 
better, but i accept that.

i feel they also should be, but this also raises libver questions. do 
they live a separate life, or do we go with one and only one version 
for the whole shebang?

certainly. in a static world, none of this thread applies at all. in 
that case, any harbour package is only used by a developer 
(application developer writing prg code, producing executables that 
only (dyn)link against stuff outside harbour), thus making the whole 
"proper package" idea moot at best, as any package becomes "just" a 
convenience container, for which the current setup is ok. won't ever 
enter any distro, but if no end-user is ever to use it, then it 
doesn't matter either.

no, no. i'm not talking "versions", i'm talking "instances". both you 
and i have r13450 sources. you build on your system, i build on mine.
can you be sure we have a libharbour.so with the exact same 
functionality? no, you can't.

btw, is this api or abi compatibility that is promised?

i fail to see why, but let's not get lost in this detail. i'll just 
accept your point.

this flat out can not be true ;)

if you have slang-dev installed and i don't, you get a libharbour with 
gtslang, i get one without. same sources, system-dependent result.

take glibc as an example. the getpwnam function. this is quite very 
core of a functionality to glibc, yet you will only find stubs in 
glibc.so - because the backing store for storing user accounts can be 
files, berkeley db, ldap, nis, whatever. consequently, the actual 
implementation lies in libnss_files.so (for a file backing store), 
libnss_nis.so (for nis), etc. the actual implementation is loaded on 
demand by glibc (which also severely affects static linking glibc 
(read, you can't), but hb needs not follow that particular segment of 
the path ;)

analogously, it could be so that gtnul is always built into 
libharbour.so proper, and a number of gt*.sos are built as well. if 
you request gtsln, the requisite gtsln.so is dl'ed by libharbour, and 
all is well. if for any reason it can't be linked in, you get a 
runtime error.

dunno how that affects hbmk and linking, tho.

a couple of cycles more at application startup, yes, but we are not on 
z80 cp/m anymore ;). the upside is that you get consistent libharbour 
with controllable dependencies (why exactly should i install this 1.5 
meg worth of libslang onto a pos machine with 4 megs of flash 
otherwise using curses for it's character cell display? why should i 
install 60 megs worth of x junk onto this server that only runs 
przemek's latest "dbf server"? linux people tend to think this way ;), 
and, at times, some of these points actually make sense).

this hierarchy can nicely be reflected in the packages.

i'm growing to think we should, for reasons outlined above.

which one do you want me to argue for? :)

regardless, it is true that the safest is probably the second.

yes, that is a good idea.

this could be a fine starting point, but (surprise! :) it is not 
without side effects.

say there's harbour-bindings version 0, depending on fbird, odbc, pg.
somewhere along the line odbc gets dropped from svn. now, at next 
release, harbour-bindings version 1 will depend on fbird and pg, so 
fbird and pg will not get upgraded (as they are blocked by the fact 
that the package manager won't want to remove odbc). if you muscle in, 
and upgrade bindings anyway, you'll pretty silently lose odbc.

this is perfectly normal this way, i'm just spelling this out for all 
aspects to be known. *i* know this and read upgrades carefully (still 
can't tell you how many times have i been bitten in the.. bottom), but 
i think most of the target audience doesn't have 15 years of systems 
experience behind their belts. and just like that, we have two groups 
of people with only marginally overlapping needs, both needs to be 
catered for ;)

i think these are pretty orthogonal. the established procedure of 
using (in the code) only features available in some widely recognised 
standard works out real nice. anything else there's no universal 
agreement for. i'd be happy to arrange a meeting, gear up my office 
with exotic stuff, and show you?how unix, unix and unix look, swim and 
quack completely differently, over a sizeable cup of coffe ;)

some redhat people will have to chime in, i'm afraid that's about as 
far as my rpm skills go. maybe istvan wants to get on board? :)

this may very well be the case. or it may not. i honestly have no of 
that level of difference between suse, rh, pld, and whatnot using rpm.

me, my last encounter with windows as my desktop was freshman year at 
college, playing tie fighter. i have never for one split second 
considered giving parents anything but windows. makes them happy, 
consequently makes me happy ;)

again, orthogonal. what is built by the current process needs to be  
built for the packages as well. what needs to be decided is the 
grouping of these components based on various criteria:

- customs and practices
- policies
- subsystem interdependencies
- usw usw.

the autohell (or any of the alternatives) aid in porting the code, 
which is currently done by strategically placed ifdefs in a couple of 
places. currently, i don't think any such thing is desperately needed. 
przemek hints some level of auto* usage every now and then, and i'm 
sure he'll come up with just the right level of integration, whatever 
that might be.

what does that mean? is it time for feature requests? :) i'm thinking, 
maybe this should be the spot where building cross-compiler packages 
could get some support? not that i'd have any more specifics at this 
moment. maybe a quick look at some existing crosscompiler package 
could give an idea or two.

It depends on the setup. For cases where Harbour 
is built to be installed in "system locations", 
the binaries are built against the shared lib.

That's true, although hbrun is _not_ part of the 
default core package we're talking about. hbrun 
however, requires shared lib.

Well, standalone apps built using Harbour and part 
of Harbour package can be like that (like hbrun), 
but I think this projects primary goal is to build 
a compiler, and even hbrun may need .ch header and 
even such dbf server is most likely to have a client 
side, which will in turn need the compiler.

What you describe fits the 'harbour-tool' category, 
which is fine.

So to reiterate, maybe a "harbour-dynlibs" package, 
and a "harbour-staticlibs" package are justified, but 
only as long as these are always pulled by "harbour-core" 
package. "harbour-tools" package would only pull 
"harbour-dynlibs".

Since they are meant as separate entities, we 
should have the option to untie they versioning 
from core anytime. Until they live inside the 
same repository, we should sync their version to 
core.

The only thing we can guarantee is that 2.0.0 (release) will 
be compatible with 2.0.2 (release), but we don't guarantee 
that 3.0.0 will be compatible with any of them.

Revision-level compatibility isn't achievable, and it would 
be insane to pursue such goal. It's simply unmanageable.

Ideally both.

That would mean every SVN revision is a final release. 
Who would guarantee this promise? Or, who would try to 
document all the changes in between each revision which 
happens to break some compatibility details?

I think here on the dev lists users are too much given 
the impression that each SVN revision is a release, 
because these revisions are most of the time stable. 
But: they are not.

I you ask me, I wanted to pull out gtcrs and gtsln from 
inside the core for somewhat similar reasons, but it got 
blocked by few users.

I don't know, but we should try to gather all such 
possible issue and come up with answers. There is no 
other way. One thing is intent and theory and one 
other is current reality.

Fine with me. Although we need to keep a certain 
amount of features to stay C5.2 compatible a provide 
a common framework for Harbour apps. So such tripping 
needs should stop at one point.

No doubt this can be argued, I told my current POV,

I understand. Well, there _should_ be some meaningful 
ways to deal with these problems, I don't think Harbour 
is such a unique type of software that we'd need to reinvent 
everything. For good examples, we can peek into python 
and ruby solutions. Problem set is quite similar.

But the truth is that the world mostly consists 
of "moms and dads and sisters". If Linux ever 
wants to target them, it'll have to adapt, 
packaging hell isn't a good marketing tool ;)

BTW my mom uses OS X :) Everyone else uses Windows, 
and luckily, it's not me having to kill off the 
trojans from time to time. Which makes me happy also.

Yes, we seem to be fine. I see some room for improvements

Cross-compiling can be put into the mix, I can't remember 
ATM how deeply we went into with the last dir layour proposal 
sent to this list by Przemek. Anyhow it's something we need 
to plan for, it's an important topic. Even on a personal 
level: I'd like to eventually drop my Windows VM for good.

I am only a Harbour developer List Reader and a Linux User with some
experience

I use linux from 1997

and you know that I can`t modify the way that the package was created
I not  have commit permission only read , and my comment`s are to leave
this diference clear .

Why If Harbour have a lot of REAL developers , they Release a new version
without
having the people designed to prepare the binaries packages ?

Many programmers not know howto compile harbour in linux , I help a lot of
user's
in other Harbour Lists to do that.

This is the reason that I take the job when massimo ask in the list if
anybody could make the

linux packages .

I know my limitations , but harbour need beta testers too , I am a beta
tester.

I think you need to take care what you write in the list

Best Regard' s

Sorry to jump-in.

Thank you for all your contributions.
But please look at Lorenzo's message, he is not offending 
in any manner and is not a personal message at all.
He is talking on technical issue, and we, as Harbour developers
are expected to behave in a professional manner.

I see that you are pulling the issue to unnecessary length.

Hope that you understand my intensions and continue to 
contribute as you being.

Thanks Pritpal , I know that the subject of this thread is exausted
but I see this problems , in the list a lot if  time' s when people try to
help

and you know that not exist a real list for final user's , I am a final user
trying to help others

My apologies about that

Every developer consumes its own free time and life to 
do anything on Harbour, so such question simply cannot 
be asked. Only if it were a payware product, such complaint 
could be justified. But Harbour is free.

So our direction here is to make the build process as 
much easy as possible and documented, so that it doesn't 
require a highly qualified volunteer to do it.

I believe a user who can't currently build Harbour on 
Linux, will have huge problems with other basic tasks also. 
It's so simple. It's not obligatory to use Linux or to 
use Harbour, and this list isn't meant as a teach course 
how to use Linux.

> This is the reason that I take the job when massimo ask in the list if anybody could make the 

I appreciate all your efforts, and this is exactly what 
we need, so pls keep up your input.

The only thing to keep in mind is that sometimes it's 
good to have some discussions before committing a 
change to SVN, and not everyone is always and readily 
available, so it's good practice to give some time to 
wait for responses.

That's what Lorenzo was asking, pls don't take it 
as an offense.

Brgds,
Viktor

We have both a Harbour users' forum and a Harbour users' 
mailing list, and they were created exactly for these kinds 
of "HOWTO" discussions.

Our current topic about proper install dir doesn't belong there, 
but general build questions do.

Brgds,
Viktor

I understand all of your words , and my intention was that others understand

the same thing

Because if this I tell to Lorenzo to take care about the words used.

It think this issue terminated.

Thanks

One more reason to redirect traffic there, otherwise 
it's a catch 22, nobody goes there (even with relevant 
question), because there is nobody there :)

Community experts pls jump on this how to resolve that.

in my opinion is due to different need of user and developer
but Harbour have a user that are also developer
we need a unique subscription for either service

Each user choice his kind of subscription

 kind a
    subscribe read developer list (for
    read and write user list

kind b
  subscribe in read and write either developer and user list


Anybody know if/how is possible?


Viktor
I want try see harbour user (not developer as requested few day ago)
in google group
can you add harbour-project+garchive-94862@googlegroups.com to
harbour-users list?

I don't understand that, anybody can 
subscribe to these in any combinations.

No. Unless I can remove the rest. Did you read my e-mail?
Why do you need a 5th replication service?

make it mandatory subscription to a user list to access developer list
so we have all user that read either mailing
but a more limited number of user that can post on developer mailing list

Harbour have few documentation so must grow only with good assistance

Okay, I get it.

Dunno if that's doable, but I guess it would create 
a sort of confusion, because some e-mails would be 
repliable, some not.

Anyway, dev list can now be read in a multitude of 
read-only web-interfaces, so it's already doable, 
if someone bothers.

I believe we need to find a non-technical resolution 
to the problem.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi

I'm user of linux from 95
maybe I'm wrong but right place to install from packaging system deb or 
rpm are /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /usr/include etc.  This systems are able to 
install and uninstall packages and there are not mess up

locally compiled  and installed software always are placed in 
/usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/include
and that are clean situation and is easy to find what is installed locally

standard unix path settings are:

    
PATH=/home/siki/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin

that means that locally compiled software are used and are very easy to 
change which versions  are used

no other magic

best regards
Davor

so it is controlled by some heuristics mechanism, i couldn't quickly 
find where this is. i suppose it has to do with known sysloc paths. 
building the deb n stuff it looks like:

! HB_BIN_INSTALL: /usr/bin
! HB_LIB_INSTALL: /usr/lib/harbour
! HB_INC_INSTALL: /usr/include/harbour
! HB_DOC_INSTALL: /usr/share/doc/harbour
! HB_INSTALL_PREFIX automatically set to: /usr/local

this might be it. install locations are explicitly set, but setting 
install_prefix doesn't take these into account, and is also set to a 
non-system loc, which in turn somehow controls dyn builds.

it is generally not acceptable to ship packages like this. especially 
if there is a shared lib, then it shall be used by applications.

this to me feels like breaking the principle of least surprise. what 
is in "harbour-dynlibs" would be called "libharbour-dev" by convention 
(watch me cheat, it would be called harbour-devel in rpm-land :), but 
the principle of separation still is the same); similarly, 
harbour-statislibs would be harbour-dev; although i agree that the 
fact that there is a runtime and also a compiler is provided by hb 
makes this a little special.

maybe so that libharbour has the shared objects, libharbour-dev has 
the static archives and the headers. are ch needed when only using an 
app linked against libharbour? if yes, and for example hbrun needs 
that, tools can be made to depend on -dev.

"harbour" would then have the compiler, pp and the rest of the gang.

libhb is the base of all stuff. hbrun pulls libhb-dev, harbour pulls 
in hbrun (and lets hbrun implicitly pull libhb-dev).

what existing package might be similar to this that could be studied 
for some inspiration? i can't really think of any now.

it just dawned on me that there also is hbide, which for the moment 
lives in contrib yes, but is shortly (for an arbitrary definition of 
"short") is expected to enter core, so i think we also should take a 
harbour-ide package into consideration right at the beginning.

i'd rather prefer it not be made part of dev.

they should stay core functionality-wise, but by using a loading 
mechanism of a kind, they should be separately packageable. gtwxc is 
probably a better example: core, functionality-wise? definitely. but 
it also has a huge dependency-list many might not be willing to pull.

certainly. but i'm still not talking *stripping* functionality, i'm 
talking *separating alternatives*.

here's a question leading to philosophical depths. with regard to gt 
drivers, how would you define "c52 compatibility"? i'm quite sure the 
answer is quite close to "it needs to be able to output stuff". but 
does it matter where to? by the very virtue of being multi-platform, 
the *only* possible common denominator is gtnul (no, not even pca or 
friends - what if there's no "terminal-ish" output of any kind? ok, 
cgi might still fit. damn. :)). behold, back at square one ;)

but then, i'm not against having say, pca and cgi in libhb. they don't 
need extra dependencies, and this whole thing is about controlling 
dependencies.

 > I can just encourage others to join up.

to me this thread has already grew tentacles into many directions that 
i can't really follow it anymore ;) maybe it'd be time to kill it, 
wait for przemek to read through it, and start new threads on specific 
subtopics.

Be sure you have the qt dev library installed open a terminal from
Applications?Accessories?Terminal and copy and paste the row below:

sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get -f install; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade;

The system will ask you a password, give your user password, you will
not see any back-chars to the screen while you type your password then
press enter.

And then copy from here and paste into terminal the row below:

sudo apt-get install libqt3-mt-dev libqt4-dev libqt4-opengl-dev
libqwt5-qt4-dev libsoqt-dev-common libsoqt4-dev pyqt4-dev-tools
python-qt4-dev qt3-dev-tools qt4-dev-tools

Then retry to compile the demoqt.prg copy and paste the row below one
row a time then press enter:

cd $HOME/src/harbour_svn/contrib/hbqt/tests
hbmk2 demoqt.prg
./demoqt

Hope this helps

I am in very heavy changes and this commit has 
just increased my time a lot. Can you please revert them.
I will apply them, probably hb_fileExist(), later. Other one 
I have already fixed .

Please defer any commits to hbIDE, other libs are ok.

Ignore my previous message.
I have recovered from my backup and have applied 
the missing links. You may need to review hb_fileexits() changes.

Separate RPM with Harbour shared library is necessary for user
who want to install dynamically linked Harbour applications.
Now they have to install whole Harbour compiler though they will
never try to compile anything. This part has to be fixed.
As long as we do not create shared version of some harbour contrib
libraries which needs 3-rd party libs like UnixODBC, postgres, mysql,
ADS, ... then we can merge all other packages with static libs into
single package because static libraries do not create explicit
dependencies. Anyhow if we plan to distribute also shared version
of above libraries in the future then they have to be in separated
packages to not force installing bound 3-rd party software. Otherwise
installing Harbour from RPM we will force installing RPMs with shared
libraries for all 3-rt party components.
We have also separate RPM with Harbour compiler and tools. Before
hbmk2 when only hb* scripts were used it was usable because it was
possible to not install harbour static libraries if someone wanted
to create only dynamic ones. I still think that hbmk2 should be
fixed to work without hbcplr and hbdebug anyhow it's not such important
as separate RPM with Harbour shared library so this can be ignored.

best regards,
Przemek

Good point.

I think the above is wrong because it tries to override 
make system, while it simply should set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX 
to /usr and let it set the rest automatically. In case 
there is a problem with these settings it should be 
fixed in global.mk.

Or HB_DYN_INSTALL should be also set. Should be checked 
why HB_INSTALL_PREFIX is used behind the scenes directly.

Please note that I used these "names" just like as 
an indication of their content, not as final names, final 
names should be whatever they be, and I'm not interested 
in the details too much to be honest, there are much 
better candidates to decide on that :) (to me it's total 
mess: see. harbour-dev vs harbour-devel to start with :/)

I had python and ruby in mind, but I can't guarantee 
they are similar "enough", for sure their 'contrib'

I think such things should be always packaged separately, 
they may have pretty large requirements, and there is no 
point in forcing anyone to install qt libs just to use 
Harbour. Same goes for anything else executable which 
currently resides in contrib or examples, like hbnetiosrv.

As a general rule of thumb I wouldn't add fat to core 
unless absolutely necessary, but rather grow a vivid 
circle of addons as separate packages.

Also notice that current GNU make system doesn't support 
building of executable in the contrib area. Maybe it 
would work, but I certainly haven't tried it, and I bet 
it would need some polishing here and there.

I have also the notion to move out all contribs from 
GNU Make territory and make them build with hbmk2. 
This would nicely solve the dynlib creation problem, 
plus few other ones (more lose integration with core, 
easily detachable, good test bed for hbmk2, etc). 
This system is already implemented for the /examples 
tree.

Sorry, but I don't see it as core 'functionality-wise'. For core 
it's enough to provide one working GT _per platform_, to have basic 
functionality and C5.x compatibility, the rest is extra. The whole 
point of GTs is that they are replaceable and extendable by anyone.
It's not satanic to provide GTs from outside core, even if they 
are maintained/developed by us. See GTALLEG, GTWVG, GTQTC, they 
are examples for that.

AFAIU the only reason they are still in core, is that some 
users (most notably Lorenzo and Przemek) are needing these 
to be part of core harbour dynlib. They also need other extra 
libs as part of "core" harbour dynlib. This IMO defeats 
the point of harbour dynlib, since it contains arbitrary 
elements, and it's used a flexible container for whatever 
some users may require for their final app. Such thing 
is okay if done locally (and probably using some distinctive 
name for such customized harbour dynlib), but for sure not 
acceptable for mainstream Harbour.

Maybe since now there is the already mentioned undocumented 
way to create customized Harbour dynlibs, this specific 
issue is no more.

The remaining showstopper is missing dynamic build support for 
such non-core libs. If that's solved, we may easily detach 
gtsln, gtcrs and gtxwc from core, and handle them as regular 
(but first class) contrib citizens.

Dynamic loading of replaceable components is a very good idea, 
both for GTs and RDDs. (although IMO not a requirement for 
anything we discuss here)

To me it looks the same thing. If there are alternatives we 
will have alternative "frameworks", which to me doesn't look 
like a very good idea when talking about a language. For sure, 
GTs and RDDs are replaceable, so strictly we only need to 
provide the basics (what was available in C5.x).

If it supports a "full screen" type of output, it's IMO okay.

STD, CGI and PCA are not enough for C5.x compatibility.

Yes, they should be std components.

Okay.

To me so far there are these important issues to solve:
- Building dynamic lib variant of contribs (and versioning them)
- Building executables in contribs
- Moving elements from core to contrib, which have 
  external dependencies (gtsln, gtcrs, gtxwc).
- Switching to hbmk2 as build tool for contrib area.
- Draw the dependency tree for whole Harbour SVN

Brgds,
Viktor

Sorry but I don't understand. These are just some simple 
lines, and the whole point of SVN is to allow common 
work. If you have heavy local changes, inform us _before_ 
you start.

Fine, thanks. hb_FileExists() is a direct replacement 
of File(), if its parameter is expected to be a file 
(not a dir) and if it doesn't have wildcards.

This means in 99% of real-life cases, you can simply 
use hb_FileExists() where you would use File().

Okay.

I've attached original harbour.spec with some minor 
local fixes.

hbmk2 could easily be "fixed" simply by not adding 
these libs at all in neither static or dynamic builds.

This will however make hbmk2 usage somewhat more 
complicated for users. For sure hbdebug is something 
I'd let hbmk2 to handle automatically, otherwise 
I envision many support questions.

Viktor

    A lot of changes are in effect including the patch 
    sent by Vailton. The code is in the middle of restructing
    phase and may take several days to finish. Till the I request
    you all to bear with me and may expect some bumps too.
    Please do not update this code until I finish preliminaries.

    To sumup this commit includes:
    ! Thourough reclassification of classes and separation of
      code fragments in a way that not two developers collide
      with each other. One may takeup one segment and the other another.

    + Used hbide_* namespace and have changed almost every function.

    + Implemented, though not in a way I wanted, building a project
      via Qt's process classes. You will see a refreshing difference.

    + A major breakthrough in XbpQtUiLoader() class implementation.
      Now you can access the child widgets of a .ui component per
      this syntax:
          oUI:qObj[ "checkMatchCase" ]:setChecked( .t. )
                    =>
          oUI:q_checkMatchCase:seChecked( .t. )
              ^^
      just prefix object name with "q_" ( Q + Underscore ).
      This greatly simmplifies coding and allows to exploit child
      widgets as real-time objects.

Lorenzo, 0x80 is not correct position for euro sign in any ISO CPs.
None of ISO CPs contains characters in range 0x80 - 0x9F. These are
control codes in many hardware devices so such range is excluded.
As usual MS defined unportable CPs using characters in reserved range
so for the rest of world it's a bug. I.e. some terminals may not show
such characters but use them as control codes.
Because this range of characters is not used then in some programs
it's hacked to accept some other characters character. Recently they
begin to convert CHR(0x80) to unicode 0x20AC character as workaround
for buggy programs which use ISO-8850-1 CP with euro sign. ISO-8859-1
does not contain euro sign so any program or text like HTML page which
sets ISO-8859-1 and then try to use euro sign without explicit unicode
value encoding is wrong and has to be fixed. In some software audits
such basic things are checked at the beginning so it's important to
keep correct encoding if you want to expect positive results.

AFAIR in the past you asked me to add such hack for euro sign into
GTXWC so now we have in gtxwc.c this code:

      if ( outISO == 0x20ac )
      {
         buf[0] = (BYTE) 0x80;
         n = 1;
      }

and as usual dirty hack sooner or later creates new problems.
Above code should be removed and we should implement clean solution
probably using real input context. It needs some additional
modifications but it's necessary also for extended keyboard layouts
in some countries. I do not have time for it now so as temporary
solution I'll replace above code with other hack which will not use
hardcoded euro position and maybe I'll return to this problem in the
future in some spare time and change keyboard code in GTXWC to use
input context.

ITISB (ISO-8859-1B) is nothing more then non portable local Harbour CP
anyhow it has euro sign in exactly the same position as in ITWIN
(CP-1250) so above does not change anything for using euro sign.
Of course I'm talking about default Harbour CPs. If you have different
results then it means to you used modified ITISB or you made some mistake
in your tests. It doesn't matter what CP you will use. The only one
important thing is using correct values for different encoding so other
programs can correctly decode the data.

I think that you should look at ChangeLog or CVS/SVN history for both
projects. This code disappeard in Harbour SVN when _YOU_ committed
_MY_ new version of GTWIN and was never fixed untill recent Jacek
reports.
After few years you fixed the problem in xHarbour only but it was the
time when I was stopping to work on xHarbour moving to Harbour so I
didn't try to check each commit in xHarbour CVS line by line.
Probably I haven't even seen that you committed it or I simply ignored
such enigmatic ChangeLog message:
    * correct potential stack overflow in gt_setmode
because it was for old GT system which in Harbour I replaced by
the new one.
Said that your fix were never applied in Harbour though you knew
the problem long ago. I'll be very happy if you can send even single
line note about any new problems you find in GT code also to Harbour
devel list so we can verify it and fix.

Below is a message with reference to above ChangeLog entries.
Look at dates.

Przemek

I do not think so. The above code use old static multi GT API which
I implemented only in xHarbour and it was never part of Harbour where
I created dynamic multi GT API committed at:
   2006-02-04 17:05 UTC+0100 Przemyslaw Czerpak (druzus/at/priv.onet.pl)
which now it used by both projects.

In Harbour the problem exists from 2002 and it was introduced when
Paul committed my initial alternative GTWIN implementation at:
   2002-10-19 16:50 UTC-0500 Paul Tucker <ptucker@sympatico.ca>

It means that you had to take above code from xHarbour.
I've just check that above fix were committed to xHarbour CVS by Paul at:
   2006-07-01 18:35 UTC-0500 Paul Tucker <ptucker@sympatico.ca>

Many thanks for your time.
I've removed all my changes and I'm working with a clean 2.0.0 but
what I've found is that pseudo standards are often supported better
than officials ones.

This is what comes from MySql's
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/charset-we-sets.html
>>>>
latin1 is the default character set. MySQL's latin1 is the same as the
Windows cp1252 character set. This means it is the same as the
official ISO 8859-1 or IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
latin1, except that IANA latin1 treats the code points between 0x80
and 0x9f as "undefined," whereas cp1252, and therefore MySQL's latin1,
assign characters for those positions. For example, 0x80 is the Euro
sign. For the "undefined" entries in cp1252, MySQL translates 0x81 to
Unicode 0x0081, 0x8d  to 0x008d, 0x8f  to 0x008f, 0x90  to 0x0090, and
0x9d to 0x009d.
<<<<<

the same is for openoffice, pdfs, rtfs, HP PCL the only "consistent
way" I found to get to get the euro sign is when it's at 0x80.
The only problem I found so far is that postgresql refuses to import
chr(141) when client is set to WIN1252 and memoedit uses chr(141) for
soft crs so I found several of them in my dbfs.

The other issue is that I need to share DBFs between gttrm/gtxwc/gtwvt
and C53/FW16 apps and "ANSI" seems to be the only common charset I
found so far. ITISB was perfect but now I need to support more
european languages so I can't use it anymore.

BTW I've tried to remove the hack:

     if ( outISO == 0x20ac )
     {
        buf[0] = (BYTE) 0x80;
        n = 1;
     }

but I can't type the Euro sign without it.

The language support is becoming a big issue. What happen if a
customer want to start to work with Poland or Hungary?

best regards,
Lorenzo

  * harbour/src/rtl/gtxwc/gtxwc.c
    ! cleaned a little bit hack with euro sign support
    + added optional support for input respecting locale settings
      To enable it it's necessary to recompile GTXWC with HB_XWC_USE_LOCALE
      macro. It can be done globally using
         export UH_USER_CFLAGS=-DHB_XWC_USE_LOCALE
      and recompiling Harbour core code.
      When enabled GTXWC initialize locale at startup (LC_CTYPE only) what
      enable national keyboard layout support in default input context
      (XLookupString()). Current Harbour core code does not use any
      <ctype.h> functions so enabling locale should not effect user
      national settings in HVM.

Prezmek,

The message you quote says that was from 2008, and it seems reasonable to 
me.  The code quoted _was_ from xHarbour.  That change (and perhaps a couple 
of others) just never made it to Harbour at all.  There was an update from 
you that I recall having to re-edit some changes back in xHarbour.

I added this March 18, 2005.  The Dispbegin/DispEnd has been in since the 
very first entry in CVS for gtwin.c (2001), but you left it out of your code 
for some reason.  In any case, the gt code was replaced by Phil Krylov on 
March 16 2008 (3 years to the day!) - Not by me.

Isn't 2005-ish around the time you switched to Harbour?

As for 'Enigmatic Changelog entry' - I don't know what you mean by that.  If 
the changelog says that a stack overflow was fixed, why ignore it?  It was 
meant to describe a fix I made to the original verion of the code in 
question.

So you made it a year before. I really had to missed it. Sorry but
it's probably one of few thousands other users commits in  xHarbour
CVS I was not checking line by line.
Working on new GT code in Harbour I didn't took GTWIN from xHarbour
but worked on them using Harbour code.
In general I try to not use any code from xHarbour as is. Number
of bugs in  xHarbour code is too big to follow all of them.
Fortunately it's not a problem now. There is nothing in xHarbour what
does not exist in Harbour or does not have much better and faster
replacement so there is nothing to take. Number of modifications in
xHarbour CVS is minimal so there is a big chance that we do not drop
sth important. Anyhow explicit info should always help.

This entry is very clear. I was talking about the one I wrongly referred.

Try GTXWC from current SVN:
   2010-01-04 13:10 UTC+0100 Przemyslaw Czerpak (druzus/at/priv.onet.pl)

It should work with CPs having euro sign on different position, i.e.
with modified ITISO using ISO-8859-15 or ISO-8859-16.

You can also compile it with HB_USER_CFLAGS=-DHB_XWC_USE_LOCALE.
In such case it enables locale what should help when some local
keyboard layout are used.

Can you make it like in hb* scripts which check if each harbour
static library enabled by default exist before adding it to linked
library list?
It's enough to enable such logic in hbmk2 for hbcplr and hbdebug.
Such modification does not change anything for hbmk2 users.

If this is the only reason then we should revert this modification.
For such functionality we have //info switch which can be used to
verify if FM statistic module is enabled and how much memory was
allocated and released. Just simply run any applications with this
switch, i.e.:
   myapp.exe //info

Can you pls do it? I'm unsure what should be the "revert"

initial one.

    ! Reapplied my File() -> hb_FileExists() pacth.

      Please note that it's not my favourite pass-time to 
      find out which of my changes were overwritten and such 
      practice pretty much defeats the purpose of version 
      tracking systems like SVN altogther. It's committers
      job to properly resolve conflicts, unless there is
      as advance request for commit-stop.
      Since it's also not very efficient for me to refix all
      future File() usages to hb_FileExists(), it would
      be much more beneficiary for the whole project if coding 
      practices like that would be adopted by other developers
      and taken care of in future updates. Thanks in advance.

Hi Pritpal, Vailton,

I'd like to propose to give Vailton SVN R/W access, 
as current way of working is pretty much inefficient.

This way Vailton could directly update the repository 
instead of sending static patches from possible outdated 
sources.

It will be much easier for everyone.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi all;

I have a function 'AT()' can not be compiler,
I use 'nPos := At( ';', cPrinters, nStart )',

If I have not joined a custom function, I will be unable to successfully compile the code.

    #xtranslate At(<a>,<b>)     => hb_At(<a>,<b>)

Who can I ask this grammar by adding "hbcompat.ch" do?

I was talking about these lines added by Istvan:

   else
   {
      hb_conOutErr( hb_conNewLine(), 0 );
      hb_snprintf( buffer, sizeof( buffer ), HB_I_("Memory allocated but not released: none") );
      hb_conOutErr( buffer, 0 );
   }

When //info runtime switch is used (explicitly as application parameter
or using HARBOUR envvar) then memory statistic is always present so it's
not necessary to show such dummy message.
Before I'll remove it I'll wait for Istvan opinion.

hbcompat.ch is a file which try to hide some differences between Harbour
and xHarbour using PP rules.
If possible I strongly suggest to to migrate to clean Harbour code and not
use it.
The AT() function in Harbour is fully compatible with Clipper/xBase/ADS/...
AT() function. We do not used to modify any existing xBase functions to
not create portability problems when standard functions with extended
parameters are used in expressions which are shared between different
dbase compatible RTLs or when some code has to be compiled by different
compilers. This is very important because using standard dBase functions
with unportable extended parameters may exploit serious problems in really
unexpected places, i.e. when indexes are used by programs compiled by other
compilers or by some remote RDDs like ADS. Harbour is strictly compatible
with Clipper/dBase so if it's documented that some other language (except
xHarbour :() supports the some dbase functions then they should work in
the same way and you do not have to check all parameters and worry that
index will be corrupted because foreign code wrongly understand local
extensions to standard functions.

It's not after my patch, they are some missing 
modifications from this patch:

I hope Pritpal can fix these remaining old APIs to new ones.

Many thanks, it works.

I've changed ITISO to use:
...
#define HB_CP_INFO      "Italian ISO-8859-15"
#define HB_CP_UNITB     HB_UNITB_8859_15
...
and I can type the euro symbol the same if I change to ITWIN.

I'm sorry, I completely forgot the gtxwc hack.
Clearly it worked only with codepages with euro in 0x80.

I'll do some tests.

Hi Przemek,

First of all Happy New Year!

The intention behind of this message, is to inform the developer that everything goes well: the FM statistic module collects the necessary info and the analysis at the end of the program execution detects that there is no memory leak. In the previous solution the analyzer remained mute in this situation (no memory leak detected) and the developer tried to hunt for a possible bug, this was my experience too, maybe it was my fault. So my impression is that this info can be useful for the developers, that the all allocated blocks are released correctly.

To be exact, this is the final solution implemented here by Viktor with the same intention behind as I understood correctly.

Best regards,
Istv?n

I was talking about these lines added by Istvan:

   else
   {
      hb_conOutErr( hb_conNewLine(), 0 );
      hb_snprintf( buffer, sizeof( buffer ), HB_I_("Memory allocated but not released: none") );
      hb_conOutErr( buffer, 0 );
   }

When //info runtime switch is used (explicitly as application parameter
or using HARBOUR envvar) then memory statistic is always present so it's
not necessary to show such dummy message.
Before I'll remove it I'll wait for Istvan opinion.

best regards,
Przemek

Yep. I agree.

A note for Vailton:
   1. Format the code per Harbour standards. Sometimes I find it very
difficult.
   2. IF | FOR | ... control structures must be closed with matching ENDIF |
NEXT, etc...
          < End > for every constrol structure does not allow you to
visualize boundaries.
   3. If possible, please discuss for a feature in advance to avoid my
overall diagram about hbIDE.

Vailton, you are a good programmer nevertheless.

Please grant him SVN access.

Pritpal Bedi

Okay, IMO even this version is redundant, pls decide about it.

Yes, plain "END" is impossible to fix with automated tools, 
so it becomes a time consuming manual task. Even HBIDE itself 
cannot properly syntax highlight it.

All what you need is running your progrm with //info parameter.
Just try.
IMHO it's much better solution then adding the message:
   "Memory allocated but not released: none"
which is always shown when application is closed.

Hi Pritpal!

Ok! I read the file c:\harbor\doc\codestyl.txt and I have strived to
contribute code in these rules. Please let me know if something is not
right so I can correct me, because the intention was only help and not
 generate more work for anyone.

I agree and much with it. I'll be careful from now on to this.

After you finish these upgrades, I re-read the code and let's talk a
little more about what features we can implement the tool, ok?

This doc is very outdated, pls check some .prg file, like 
/src/rtl/tget.prg, tbrowse.prg or /utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg 
for current standard. (most our .prgs comply but still not all)

For both of you, pls use iif() instead of if() for inline ifs.
Avoid 'RETURN ( var )' for 'RETURN var', parenthesis is redundant.
.T./.F./.OR./etc are uppercase. Some quite notes to start with.

Brgds,
Viktor

Ups. I've just seen that it was not always shown but only
when //INFO were used so it's fine for me. I only suggest
to replace:
   hb_snprintf( buffer, sizeof( buffer ),
                HB_I_("Memory allocated but not released: none") );
   hb_conOutErr( buffer, 0 );
with simple:
   hb_conOutErr( HB_I_("Memory allocated but not released: none"), 0 );

This is fine.

There is a bigger problem though behind this whole topic.

We're lured into the impression that HBQT doesn't leak memory.
I say this because HBQT in dynamic mode doesn't seem to be 
using our memory allocation functions at all, so nothing is 
tracked, which means we're getting a constant zero leak 
whatever is happening inside HBQT.

Do you have any suggestions to how to force C++ to use our 
own memory allocation function, or where to look for a solution?

Brgds,
Viktor

OK. Is more cleaner.

An another issue is I think is in hbtrace.c with the following line:

         MultiByteToWideChar( CP_ACP, 0, hb_strncpy( message, buf.psz, sizeof( message ) - 1 ), -1,
                              buf.lp, HB_SIZEOFARRAY( buf.lp ) );

The strncpy( message, buf.psz, sizeof( message ) - 1 ) can lead into a recursive HB_TRACE call, as it happened in one of my test case.

Best regards,
Istv?n

Right. I'll fix it in a while.
Thank you very much for information.

       build with hbgd and hbct libs. This is much better 
       method, since hbmk2 will locate them automatically

In Linux you can use valgrind to check memory leaks.
Just simply run:
   valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes -v ./demoqt 2> demoqt.log
and check the memory allocated and not released. If you compile Harbour
with -g GCC option (HB_USER_CFLAGS=-g) and not strip final binaries
then you will also have exact line number information. It's much more
precise information then in our own memory statistic module.
I think that you can also find some tools to test allocated and
not freed resources for MS-Windows (i.e. Pritpal was using sth like
that when he reported that HVM do not destroy internal mutexes on
exit) though probably the reports will not be very precise.

In fm.c we have code to overload C++ new operators but it's enabled
only when core code is compiled in C++ mode. If you want to enable
it in all HBQT builds then these code should be moved to one of it's
.cpp files which is always linked. It's not very elegant but it should
work.

Alternatively we can try to use dlmalloc as full replacement for
standard malloc()/calloc()/realloc()/free() functions and report
info all memory blocks not freed after HVM exit. This is the most
often used method in different devel tools catching memory leaks.
To minimize number of modifications and keep our own FM logs we
can also use dlmalloc with USE_DL_PREFIX and create our own wrappers
to above functions, i.e.:
   void * malloc( size_t size )
   {
      return hb_xalloc( size );
   }
   void * calloc( size_t size )
   {
      void * ptr = hb_xalloc( size );
      if( ptr )
         memset( ptr, 0, size );
      return ptr;
   }
   [...]

Message-ID: <9257026e1001041001t2cb7e86ek397311d32e5f0ed8@mail.gmail.com>

Under Win XP if I copy a text from a web page with german chars and
the euro symbol and I paste it into the memoedit of test/tstmemo.prg
that runs on linux instance connected with putty I don't get the
correct text while if I paste it to the bash prompt I get all the
chars. Note that if I type the same text is works.

I've done many tests with putty configuration and tstmemo SETTERMCP
but without success.

Am I missing sth?

The only "problem" with valgrind is that it doesn't work 
on Windows, and most QT developers use Windows. Otherwise 
it's indeed the best tool.

Damn. You're right, and I have even been there several times.

I'm thinking of two solutions.
1) Add these override methods to HBQT. I fear that it will 
   collide if we will have any other C++ libs in the pack.
2) Add an extra Harbour core lib named hbcpp (f.e.) and 
   build that in forced C++ mode for all targets.
   This poses a problem when given target doesn't 
   support C++ mode.

I can't oversee this solution, but for me it's good.

Next question: What to do now?

Viktor

You can. Right-click on <Project Name> node of 
<Projects Tree> and select some build option. Through menus,
though, it is not available. I do not know what went wrong.

Hopefully I will fix these issues today.

Subject: [Harbour] difference between Clipper and Harbour
Message-ID: <BLU127-W22419A4297C67F3624B93ED5740@phx.gbl>


Hi all,
I'm new to Harbour compiler. Great piece of code !
Today I tried to compile an old Clipper 5.2e program that still works.
I found a difference between the two compilers. I have made a code example. 


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Use of SET FUNC instead of SET FUNCTION
//
//This gives easy keyboard control.
//Example
//...{get code}...
//nKey := Val( KeyProcess )
//Do Case
//Case nKey == K_F2
//..Do Something
//Case nKey == K_F3
//..Do Something else
//Case nKey == K...
//...
//EndCase
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Function Main()
Local cTest := "Test "
Local cK := "2"
Local cV := "Chr( 23 ) + '-1;'"
Local nKey
           @ 0, 0 clear
           Set Func &cK to &cV
           @ 4, 0 to 4, 80
           @ 7, 0 to 7, 80
           @ 3, 2 get cTest       pict "@!"
           Read
           nKey := Val( KeyProcess( ))
           @08,0
           ?? "Main(): LastKey() -> "
           ?? lastkey()
            ? "Main(): nKey      -> "
           ?? nkey

           @20, 0
Function KeyProcess( )
Local xKey := LastKey( )
           accept ' ' to xKey
           @05,0
           ?? "Tasti(): LastKey() -> "
           ?? lastkey()
            ? "Tasti(): xKey      -> "
           ?? xkey

Return( xKey )
 
 
The accept command in Clipper works well and there is no wait, while Harbour needs an ENTER keypress to have same behaviour.
 
Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Harbour] ct functions
Message-ID: <BLU127-W1628CFCBA565F0C26EBBBFD5740@phx.gbl>


Hi all,

some ct fuctions aren't recognized by Harbour. 

 

These are

         FontReset( )               

         FontLoad(  )  
         FontSelect( )            


I added in .hbp file the -lhbct option, but without success.

Are they not yet implemented or there are new/other functions to use instead of ?

 

Best regards,

Marco

I have made a new questions about this here on Launchpad
https://answers.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/harbour/ because
this is related to Ubuntu and Harbour and we need to move questions
like this to some users (not directly development related ) more
specific group.

Please join launchpad harbour-users to reply
https://edge.launchpad.net/~harbour-users

Hope this helps

I'd like to ask you here also to keep all Harbour 
dev related discussions on this forum.

We don't have the capacity to follow several parallel

Such functionality like font reloading is available in practice only
in DOS. In all other sysystems it's impossible to load and activate
fonts using binary font definition so noone implemented above functions
It's possible that they will be added in the future for Harbour DOS builds
but you should not expect that they will work in Harbour compiled for
other platforms. They will always return -2 'Impossible in current video
mode'. Sorry but this part is out of our control and we cannot easy
emulate hardware (video adapter) behavior in modern systems where direct
access to hardware devices is blocked by OS for native application.
If such functionality is a must for you then it can be implemented in
DOS Harbour versions (just like SETFONT() is implemented in DJGPP builds)
and you can create DOS application and run it in full screen DOS mode
using windows if your windows still supports it or using DOSBOX or
similar emulator.
Other solution is converting your raw font definition to system native
font format and loading them using some system settings, i.e. by
chosing font for console window in MS-Windows for GTWIN or using
hb_gtInfo() with HB_GTI_* actions in grapic GTs like GTWVT or GTXWC.

A week has already pased :-)


HBIDE is intended to develop only graphic Aplicattion ?


In this case it's all ok


But If console aplicattions are posible target for the  IDE

Exist the posibility when launch a console aplicattion to open a TERMINAL
and then launch it

because console aplicattions not start , unless you start HBIDE manually
from a console,

in this case console aplicattions remains under the HBIDE , in the same
Terminal

This is in linux , i don't know what happen's in windows

Please always execute
   win-make clean
before you build new binaries. If it does not help then please check
if you are using _clean_ SVN code.
   svn stat
executed in root Harbour SVN directory should give empty result.

In BCC there is CodeGuard tool which you can also try to use
but I've never used it so I cannot help. Chen is our CG expert.

Linker should detect it and report symbol collision if the same
operators are overloaded more then once by different code and
dependencies forces linking both versions so even if such problem
appears then it should be easy detected at link time.

and because it's a lib then you will have to introduce mechanism
to force linking its module(s) with final application. Much more
flexible is compiled object file (.o|.obj) which can be linked
or not with final binaries. Anyhow it also needs some additional
modifications in other tools to create final elegant solution and
I do not know if it's worth of your time. Probably the simplest
modification to reach such effect locally without touching the
harbour build process is adding an option to hbmk2 to compile and
link with final application hbfm.cpp file. This file can be created
dynamically by hbmk2 or it can be added to our ./include directory.
The second version is easier for updating.

I'll check if I can implement it. Anyhow it may not work with compilers
which do not like overloading standard malloc()/free()/... functions so
not everywhere it will work.

> Next question: What to do now?

Full overloading of standard MM functions is one of options and I'll try
to add it but it's not be solution for all compilers so we should also
think about adding sth to only overload C++ new/delete operators.
See my answers for proposed by you 2 solutions and chose sth what you
think is the best and easiest to implement.

I have tried already the win-make clean but I still got the same

But, I have read Clipper 5.3 Guide and show:

AT(<cSearch>, <cTarget>) --> nPosition

The original function of only two parameters.
Why do we have to custom order it?

Exactly like in Harbour. It also has only two parameters.

Yes, I've read some text about this, it'd be too much

Though QT doesn't support BCC, so it won't help us 
where it would be the most important ATM.

Good idea. I tend to favor the dynamic creation to not 
pollute our tree with such lose files, but I'll think 
about it some more.

Okay, I'll try to make something with hbfm.cpp. Here the problem 
I see is to decide when to add it and when not, probably there should 
be a new option to control that.

Hi,

I supposed I was being a little confusing. I apologize.

I missed a step:

in the get field you need to press F2 Key 

In Clipper the result is 

tasti():lastkey()-> 13

tasti():xkey-> -1

------

main():lastkey()->13

main():nkey-> -1

 

as expected.

 

While in Hb

 

tasti():lastkey()-> 13

tasti():xkey-> -1;                <---- ; but it's not relevant now

------

main():lastkey()->13

main():nkey-> -1

 

nb: tasti() has to be read like processkey() function (tasti() is the original fuction)

 

The more significant difference is that after the F2 keypress, in HB I need to press ENTER to go on (is the ACCEPT command that needs that), while Clipper doesn't need it.

Hope to being more clear.

 

Best regards,

Marco

Hi, 

thank you for your exaustive answer.

No, it's not a must at all. I was trying to convert a sample application with Harbour. I choosed an application among the others without a fixed scope (that was the first that came in my mind...). These ct functions worked well in that application but it's easy to disable them: it's only cosmetic.

Your answer opens a wide range of other questions (at least for me), but I think not to bore all of you in long a waste-time threads, as I see you are full time engaged in coding and replying (very little time for family I suppose...). Maybe in the future ...

 

Best regards,

Marco

how use metadata?
Anybody have used similar things?


Folow is info regarding metadata
HBIDE will employ the concept of meta-data which will be used to parse the
paths or other info supplied to the interface.
Usually meta-key is enclosed in curly braces, but due to the fact that HBMK2
already exploits it, HBIDE will recognize meta-key in angled brackets.
Please enter meta-keys and their values like :
     MySourcePath = c:/dev_sources/vouch
in the QTextEdit below. Then whereever you will supply any key anywhere in
the input fields of HBIDE interface, just enclose it in angled brackets like
:
      <MySourcePath>/vouch.prg.
Note that keys are case sensitive. So MySourcePath <> MYSOURCEPath.

HBIDE internally employs few keys which are shown below and are always
include in the project. These accompany the value as its relevance and not
as literal.

Enjoy

  * contrib/hbxbp/xbpmenubar.prg
  * contrib/hbxbp/xbptoolbar.prg
    + Implemented to accept QAction() as menu constructor.
      Before only cCaption or XbpMenu() were accepted.

  * contrib/hbide/hbide.ch
  * contrib/hbide/hbide.prg
  * contrib/hbide/ideactions.prg

  * contrib/hbide/idemisc.prg
  * contrib/hbide/ideobject.prg
  * contrib/hbide/ideprojmanager.prg
    ! Next round of reforms.

    + Implemented IdeActions() class which forms the basis 
      of IDE's menus and toolbars. Now we have greater control
      over the uniformity of different actions hooked into 
      different interface elements, i.e., menu option, toolbar
      option or popup option. The same visual experience is 
      presented in all the three flavours. 

      It also implies that we can switch on/off any action 
      only at one place. For example, if you issue this command:
         ::oAC:getAction( "Save" ):setEnabled( .f. )
      then the option will be grayed in any flavour of user 
      interaction, viz., menu, toolbar, or context menu.

      The code is much cleaner and paves the way to be reloaded
      with various means.

Basically replacement function (with different syntax) can be done with
   Hb_GtInfo( HB_GTI_FONTNAME , cFont   )
   Hb_GtInfo( HB_GTI_FONTWIDTH, nWidth  )
   Hb_GtInfo( HB_GTI_FONTSIZE , nHeight )

i can suggest see
c:\harbour\tests\wvtext.prg
c:\harbour\tests\wcecon.prg
c:\harbour\tests\gtxfnt.prg
c:\harbour\tests\gfx.prg
c:\harbour\tests\gtwin.prg

as more advanced option you can migrate your app to Hibrid Gui
you can try The Hibrid Gui for windows platform gtwvg
c:\harbour\contrib\gtwvg\tests\demowvg.prg  (hbmk2 demowvg.prg)
use the Hibrid Gui multiplatform based on qt gtwvt
c:\harbour\contrib\gtqtc\tests\demoqtc.prg (hbmk2 demoqtc)
for udestranding the power of qt you can see the upcoming visual ide for
harbour hbide
c:\harbour\contrib\hbide\hbide,prg  (hbmk2 hbide)
c:\harbour\contri\hbxbp\tests\demoxbp.prg  (hbmk2 demoxbp)

with most contrib project  you must remember that  if you made your sample
out of native directory
you must copy hbmk.hbm and revise or integrate in your project file hbp

Hi!

I believe this will be very helpful if you plan to implement support
for other languages in HBIDE. Since changing only the QAction
automatically reflected in all other parts of the code.

Great news!

Message-ID: <001f01ca8e01$fdd69350$f983b9f0$@Bisz@t-online.hu>

Hi,

 

After the latest commits, I successfully (crash-free) tested the Qt - hbqt,
demoqt, demoxbp and hbide. The scope of these test cases are just focusing
on the different platforms and development environments, without functional
tests.

The test was executed on Vista SP2 and Fedora 12 with the latest updates
executed.

The good news is that now the MinGW with GCC 4.4.1 Windows builds and MinGW
with GCC 4.4.2 linux cross builds are crash free, the delete operators are
executed smoothly.

 

The following combinations are tested.

1.      Qt 4.5.3 for MinGW
(http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-4.5.3-mingw.exe)

habour,  hbqt, demoqt, demoxbp and hbide built with

http://sunet.dl.sourceforge.net/project/tdm-gcc/TDM-MinGW%20Installer/1.908.
0/tdm-mingw-1.908.0-4.4.1-2.exe with SJLJ rewinding.

2.      Qt 4.6.0 for MinGW
(http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-4.6.0-mingw.exe)

habour,  hbqt, demoqt, demoxbp and hbide built with

http://sunet.dl.sourceforge.net/project/tdm-gcc/TDM-MinGW%20Installer/1.908.
0/tdm-mingw-1.908.0-4.4.1-2.exe with Dwarf-2 rewinding.

3.      Qt 4.6.0 for vs2008
(http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-4.6.0-vs2008.exe)

habour,  hbqt, demoqt, demoxbp and hbide built with VS2008

4.      Qt 4.5.3 Fedora 12 package

habour,  hbqt, demoqt, demoxbp and hbide built with Fedora12 GCC4.4.3

5.      Qt 4.5.3 for MinGW
(http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-4.5.3-mingw.exe)

6.      habour,  hbqt, demoqt, demoxbp and hbide cross-built with Fedora 12
MinGW with GCC 4.4.2

 

Pritpal, could you please change the release method setting at the beginning
of the hbide and demoxbp to:

 

   //HBQT_SET_RELEASE_METHOD( HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DESTRUTOR )          //
Exits cleanly

   HBQT_SET_RELEASE_METHOD( HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DELETE )
//  Exits cleanly

   //HBQT_SET_RELEASE_METHOD( HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DELETE_LATER )     //  Exits
cleanly

 

I am requesting in this way, to avoid undesired interferences with the same
prg-s updates. Thank you.

Note: The demoqt already works with this release method activated.

 

Best regards,

Istv?n

Yes, it's clear now. Just simply the example is too complicated.
It's not GET or ACCEPT problem but missing ";" => Chr( 13 ) translation
in __KEYBOARD() function.
Here is reduced example which illustrate the problem:

   proc main()
      __keyboard( ";" )
      ? inkey(0)
   return nil

I'll fix it in a while. Thank you for the information.

This looks good, thank you. I'll soon add C++ mem allocation 
overload to hbmk2, so we better can test leaks.

There still remain some TOFIX-es in code:

- Returning raw pointer of GC collected objects:
   This might cause problems later, because this means 
   that a reference is stored somewhere in caller code, 
   and this reference isn't registered, so memory can 
   get freed anytime, causing GPF. See: hbqt_gcpointer()
- Storing GC collected object reference in EVENTS.
   Same as the previous one. See: QT_EVENTS_CONNECT()
- Current solution to convert .prg level objects to 
   C pointer is solved with a hack. This isn't good, 
   as it unnecessarily slows down code and is error 
   prone. See: hbqt_ptr(), and parameter converter loop.
- Low level dealing with retrieval of pointers, still 
   doesn't throw RTE, but simply returns NULL, which 
   causes GPF later. See: hbqt_gcpointer()

It difficult to judge if any of these will currently cause 
problems in real life, but until they are present in code, 
we can't be sure about it, so they are time bombs, waiting 
to explode. [ NOTE: hbide still may GPFs, so HBQT isn't 
clean yet. ]

Higher level problem:

- demoxbp in -mt mode: The second dialog doesn't work properly.
  (already reported)

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Massimo, all,


----snip


with most contrib project  you must remember that  if you made your sample out of native directory
you must copy hbmk.hbm and revise or integrate in your project file hbp
----
I'm new in hbmk2 use and I don't understand its use deeply. Can you be more clear about .hbm .hbc files and their use (a little example could help)?
Regarding hybrid mode I have to learn how to use Hb in standarb way first, simply porting an entire app to it, and add step by step new features (mouse, graphic, printer managing for example). I'm sure that I will post many other questions in the future...
 
Best regards,
Marco

Hi all,

I need to know how to show some pseudo-graphical characters like chr(16) ? chr(17) ?, etc

In Harbour these characters are translated with a little square. I think that I'm missing some declaration (like gt or similar) but I havent' found any informations regarding that.

 Using hbmk2
hbmk2 is a Tool that allow compile sample and large project
basic use of this tools is
hbmk2 ac_test
hbmk2 ac_test.prg
After this command you have ac_test.exe created
You can also immediaply execute simple using
hbmk2 ac_test -run

Hbmk2 is indipendent from Platform and Compiler that you use

Please also try the recommended way with hbmk2, it does
a similar job to your manual Makefile, but it's portable, works

for all future test programs and just one line.

If hbmk2 doesn't work for you for some reason, post your -trace output

How compile several. PRG & lib?*hbmk2* test1 test2 testn -lmylib1 -lmylib2
-lmylibn
*hbmk2* test1.prg test2.prg testn.prg mylib1.lib mylib2.lib mylibn.lib

How create a lib?*hbmk2* myprg1.PRG myprg2.prg myrc.rc  -b -m  -*hblib*

 default os enable incremental build mode   , so only modified part of your
project will be recompiled
 -rebuild flag allow
How use a config library file (hbc)?
hbc contain the library used from the project
typically exist a template for each library for include all neccessary
references
se for eaxample
/harbour/contrib/hbxbp/hbxbp.hbc
Yoy can use use hbc adding to  hbmk2 command line
use inside a hpb adding a line with path where hbc reside

How used a Project file (hbp)?
you can simply use

  -quiet             suppress all screen messages

Notes:
  - <script> can be <@script> (.hbm format), <script.hbm>, <script.hbp>
(marks
    a new target) or <script.hbc>.
  - Multiple -l, -L and <script> parameters are accepted.
  - Regular Harbour compiler options are also accepted.
  - hbmk.cfg option file in hbmk2 directory is always processed if it
exists.
    On *nix platforms ~/.harbour, /etc/harbour, <base>/etc/harbour,
<base>/etc
    are checked (in that order) before the hbmk2 directory. The file format
is
    the same as .hbc.
  - hbmk.hbm make script in current directory is always processed if it
exists.
  - .hbc config files in current dir are automatically processed.
  - .hbc options (they should come in separate lines): libs=[<libname[s]>],
    hbcs=[<.hbc file[s]>], gt=[gtname], syslibs=[<libname[s]>],
    prgflags=[Harbour flags], cflags=[C compiler flags], resflags=[resource
    compiler flags], ldflags=[linker flags], libpaths=[paths],

    head=[off|partial|full|native], skip=[yes|no], echo=<text>
    Lines starting with '#' char are ignored
  - Platform filters are accepted in each .hbc line and with several
options.
    Filter format: {[!][<plat>|<comp>|<keyword>]}. Filters can be combined
    using '&', '|' operators and grouped by parantheses. Ex.: {win}, {gcc},
    {linux|darwin}, {win&!pocc}, {(win|linux)&!watcom}, {unix&mt&gui},
    -cflag={win}-DMYDEF, -stop{dos}, -stop{!allwin},
    {allpocc|allgcc|allmingw|unix}, {allmsvc}, {x86|x86_64|ia64|arm},
    {debug|nodebug|gui|std|mt|st|xhb}
  - Certain .hbc lines (libs=, hbcs=, prgflags=, cflags=, ldflags=,
libpaths=,
    inctrypaths=, instpaths=, echo=) and corresponding command line
parameters
    will accept macros: ${hb_root}, ${hb_dir}, ${hb_name}, ${hb_plat},
    ${hb_comp}, ${hb_build}, ${hb_cpu}, ${hb_bin}, ${hb_lib}, ${hb_dyn},
    ${hb_inc}, ${<envvar>}. libpaths= also accepts %{hb_name} which
translates
    to the name of the .hbc file under search.
  - Options accepting macros also support command substitution. Enclose
command
    inside ``, and, if the command contains space, also enclose in double
    quotes. F.e. "-cflag=`wx-config --cflags`", or
    ldflags={unix&gcc}"`wx-config --libs`".
  - Defaults and feature support vary by platform/compiler.
  - Options can also be specified in environment variable HBMK_OPTIONS

Supported <comp> values for each supported <plat> value:
  - linux  : gcc, clang, icc, watcom, sunpro, open64
  - darwin : gcc, clang, icc
  - win    : mingw, msvc, bcc, watcom, icc, pocc, cygwin, xcc,
  -          mingw64, msvc64, msvcia64, iccia64, pocc64
  - wce    : mingwarm, mingw, msvcarm, poccarm
  - os2    : gcc, gccomf, watcom
  - dos    : djgpp, watcom
  - bsd    : gcc
  - hpux   : gcc
  - beos   : gcc
  - sunos  : gcc, sunpro

in harbour have support of codepage
the clipper program is made with 850?? ? ? ? ?International MS-DOS ?(oem)

the harbour basic function for  queries and optionally changes the
current code page used for character strings
HB_SetCodePage( [<cCodePageID>] )


REQUEST HB_LANG_ES
REQUEST HB_CODEPAGE_ES850C

PROCEDURE MAIN ()
  HB_SETCODEPAGE('ES850C')

You must undestand what codepage support have  the font that you want use

Please share here your result, can be usefull for other user

What GT driver you are using?
Was Harbour compiled with UNICODE macro?
Can you compile harbour/src/tests/gtchars.prg and show the screen
with all characters?

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.pt_BR.po
  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.hu_HU.po
  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    + Added support for C++ input files. Now C++ files will be compiled
      in a separate pass where native C++ compiler is used, which
      means that C++ compilation mode is now enforced by using .cpp
      extension. This also means that it's now possible to build
      mixed mode projects with both C and C++ input files.
      Enable with option: -hbcppmm (cmdline) or hbcppmm=yes (in .hbc files)
         NOTE: Suggestions for better names are welcome.
      In general, this feature makes -cpp option unnecessary, its
      only purpose now is to override default mode.
    ; Please test.

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    - Deleted support for link-related macros in C compilation phase,
      these weren't used anymore inside current hbmk2, so it seems safe,
      but it's possible nevertheless that it will cause regressions in
      some exotic use cases.

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    ! Fixed parsing -warn option on the commandline and .hbm/.hbp files.
      [TOMERGE 2.0]

  * contrib/hbqt/generator/hbmk.hbm
    ! Deleted xhb lib. It's not required and was probably added for
      "outdebug" stuff.

  * contrib/hbqt/hbqt.hbc
  * contrib/hbqt/hbqts.hbc
  * contrib/gtqtc/gtqtcs.hbc
  * contrib/gtqtc/gtqtc.hbc
    + Added hbcppmm=yes option. This will force C++ memory allocation
      functions to be overridden by Harbour mm functions.

  * src/vm/fm.c
    - Deleted C++ memory allocation functions. This feature now
      lives inside hbmk2, and it now doesn't require whole Harbour
      to be built in C++ mode.

  * contrib/hbqt/*
    * Regenerated.

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    + Added disctinctive static text which is always linked in
      when C++ mm override is active. This makes it easy to
      verify if C++ mm override is activated in an executable.

  * ChangeLog
    ! Fixed messed text in latest hbmk2 changes.

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.pt_BR.po
  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.hu_HU.po
  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    + Added support for C++ input files. Now C++ files will be compiled
      in a separate pass where native C++ compiler is used, which
      means that C++ compilation mode is now enforced by using .cpp
      extension. This also means that it's now possible to build
      mixed mode projects with both C and C++ input files.
      In general, this feature makes -cpp option unnecessary, its
      only purpose now is to override default mode.
    + Added option to override standard C++ memory management functions
      with Harbour ones.
         Enable with option: -hbcppmm (cmdline) or hbcppmm=yes (in .hbc files)
      NOTE1: Suggestions for better names are welcome.
      NOTE2: hbide will now crash with mingw if this option is enabled.
             Any idea why?
    ; Please test.

Subject: [Harbour] HBIDE + FMSTAT
Message-ID: <341848B8-B98B-4D16-A80D-563F6A1B6941@syenar.hu>

Hi All,

I got this result with FMSTAT enabled in VM, and 
running HBIDE (starting and exiting with no file open), 
using MinGW 4.4.1-2 and QT 4.5.3.

Exits cleanly
   HBQT_SET_RELEASE_METHOD( HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DELETE )
//  Exits cleanly
   //HBQT_SET_RELEASE_METHOD( HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DELETE_LATER )     //  Exits

The remaining should be analyzed.

Best regards,

    + Will now verify if HB_QT_MOC_BIN is pointing to an existing filename.
      If not, an error message will be shown, trying to make it clear how 
      to set it up properly. Many users like to set the dir only, which 
      makes the build process fail.

  * contrib/hbide/hbide.prg
    + Switched to HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DELETE as suggested by Istvan Bisz.

  * contrib/hbqt/generator/hbqtgen.prg
    * Minor cosmetic.

      options, plus a few ones which are automatically pulled anyway
      via hbqt.hbc (which is in turn pulled by hbxbp.hbc).
      Please set HB_WITH_QT to make it find the QT libs. This is
      the universal method.

The block structure printout is different, are we running different tools?

I did my tests with MinGW, regular Harbour build, 
with hbvm rebuilt with HB_USER_CFLAGS=-DHB_FM_STATISTICS option.

Then did a regular hbide rebuild and run it, and I got the 
posted results in hb_out.log.

Yours looks like trace output.

Hi All,

- "HbIDE is about to be closed" is displayed when closing it with close buttong, 
  but this message is unuseful. Should ask Yes/No.
- Menu stays greyed after opening a dialog and closing it.
  (f.e. check with "Options | Theme selection")
- Theme selection doesn't work on my system. Can't change the default.
- When opening the app, there is a main window created, which 
  is visibly resized to its final size, and it looks not very 
  professional. (at least I haven't seen such effect in other apps)
  This effect is present with all HBQT based apps.
- I'd personally use much much less (or rather no) gradient 
  effects as backgrounds. It just slows down things (f.e. when 
  working remote, or VM) and it just distracting after the initial 
  impact.

Really just scratching the surface.

Brgds,
Viktor

I've tried to compile and run hbide.exe a few times, but it is not a 
useful tool for me (yet). The most important things I expect is 
comfortable source editor with column mark blocks, multi-file search and 
replace, block copy and move operations between opened source files. 
shortcuts for editing commands. All other things like themes, background 
gradients are totally not important for me, and I would like to switch 
it off in my setup.

I know hbide is at very alpha stage and I do not want to say, that 
themes are not important for a good product, but it is not that we need 
to begin using the application.

Mindaugas

The most important things I expect is comfortable source editor with column mark blocks, multi-file search and replace, block copy and move operations between opened source files. shortcuts for editing commands. All other things like themes, background gradients are totally not important for me, and I would like to switch it off in my setup.

You pretty much summed up my needs as well.

We can certainly discuss priorities (even HBQT is 
far from stable yet), but eventually some sort of 
"theming" or color setup is inevitable I guess.
I'd only be happier if the default would be more 
clean cut MSVS/Eclipse/NetBeans-like, and not overly 
colored. I think this would be give a more 
familiar and more professional look to it. Easy 
to change anytime though.

I'm mostly concerned about general stability, speed, 
and the features you mentioned.

Brgds,
Viktor

Complicated is for me to understand why you say "every Harbour threads" and repeat.

Only activating HB_TRACE() with any example of /test/mt and adding wapi_SetLastError() you can see that this is not true.
Just store only a single ID/lasterror pairs by thread and these pairs can be made easily accessible from another thread.
I think that C don't have the problems of spoken language such as English.
But sorry, I use my code resources made before and It's maybe the reason for not having seen another solution for Harbour.

This is new for me, goto is a C99 resource, I use with macros that generated label/goto: something like this .-

#define CHKPTR( x )  if( !(x) ) do{ goto __func__##Error; }while( 0 )
#define FUN_ERROR    goto __func__##End; __func__##Error:
#define FUN_END      __func__##End:

void Anyfunction( void )
{
    void *pPtr;

    CHKPTR( pPtr = malloc(16) );
    ...
    ...
    ...
    FUN_ERROR
    ...
    FUN_END
    if( pPtr ) free( pPtr );
}

For me it's more easier to read, understand and maintain.
It stayed in the adapting to Harbour but I suppose that it's a new coding style standard in Harbour.

Thanks to you and my sincere congratulations on your code, is better for Harbour of course.
I don't have objection to change or replace my code with a code better, if not I don't be released public but
_I am absolutely disagree because the changes are not made in the repository_.

I've done and not just in this thread. I don't like the answer, no direct answer for to be accurate, but indirect understand and 
it's obvious that my feelings are not the same as before. I sincerely hope to have contributed to solve the issue.

Sorry for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience.
Thank you.

Please note that the code you sent creates an array of thread IDs.
Each unique thread ID ever given by the system to thread needs separate
entry. It's not guarantied that OS tries to use as small pool of thread
IDs as possible. Usually not because such condition needs additional
operation and creates potential problems for programmers so this is
rather range of numbers cyclically reused when free.
It means that in long running programs creating a lot of (even very short
life) threads this array is systematically growing up until it reach the
size of thread IDs range used by OS.
Then for each StoreLastError() operation this code makes covered by
mutex linear scan of this array to locate calling thread entry.
Because the array is big (probably few thousands of entries for each thread
which existed before and called at least once StoreLastError()) then it's
strongly time consuming operation which usually cost much more then the
whole operation setting it. It will kill the performance. Additionally
it strongly reduce scalability because this expensive and quite frequently
used in all WIN API functions which needs to store LastError scan operation
is covered by mutex.
Current code committed by Viktor use TLS on HVM stack what resolve such
problems. Anyhow such code used even without HVM should be fixed and it
can be easy done. Just simply call:

   static DWORD s_dwTlsIndex = TLS_OUT_OF_INDEXES;

   [...]

   void StoreLastError( DWORD dwError )
   {
      if( s_dwTlsIndex == TLS_OUT_OF_INDEXES )
      {
         /* call it at least once before the 1-st thread is created to
            avoid race condition and potential resource leak */
         s_dwTlsIndex = TlsAlloc();
      }
      TlsSetValue( s_dwTlsIndex, ( LPVOID ) dwError );
   }

   DWORD RetrieveLastError( void )
   {
      return ( DWORD ) TlsGetValue( s_dwTlsIndex );
   }

Please remember that size of TLS data is limited. In bigger programs
I suggest to make s_dwTlsIndex global variable initialized at startup
and then store inside pointer to dynamically allocated structure. In
such case your code will use only one TLS item just like Harbour for
HVM stack.
If it's necessary to access such structure also by other threads then
they should be additionally linked in some public list. This is also
done by HVM which keeps list of all HVM stacks.

    + added .prg function:
         HB_INETCOMPRESS( <pSocket>, [<nCompressionLevel>], [<nStrategy>] )
      which enables ZLIB compression for given HB_INET*() socket.
      <pSocket> is a socket created by one of HB_INET*() functions
      <nCompressionLevel> is compression factor between 1 (fastest) and
                          9 (best) (see HB_ZLIB_COMPRESSION_*)
                          0 (none) disable compression on output data
                          but decompression is still working.
      <nStrategy> is used to tune compression algorithm,
                  see HB_ZLIB_STRATEGY_*
      The compression must be enabled on both connection sides, i.e.
      on the server side:
         conn := hb_inetAccept( sock )
         hb_inetCompress( conn )
      and on the client side:
         sock := hb_inetConnect( cServer, nPort )
         hb_inetCompress( sock )
      in the same moment but it's not necessary to enable it at the
      beginning of connection. It can be done later, i.e. when both
      sides agree to enable connection using some custom protocol.
      The compression has effect only on stream connections, i.e.
      TCP and it's ignored in datagram connections like UDP.
      This function can be executed more then once changing the compression
      parameters but it causes that all data in readahead decompression
      buffer is discarded. When called with HB_ZLIB_COMPRESSION_DISABLE
      as <nCompressionLevel> then support for stream compression is removed
      and sockets works again in raw mode.
      The compression level and strategy do not have to be the same on both
      connection sides. Each side can chose the best settings for data it's
      going to send.

      This code was written in a way which allows to easy implement
      alternative compression methods or other extensions like encryption
      in existing HB_INET*() sockets also by non core code. The public C
      functions declared in hbznet.h allows to use this extension with raw
      harbour sockets two.

Thank you. I personally prefer as few colors 
as possible, and as far as I can see, this is 
the way its done in most tools that I happen to 
use. So, my vote is for plain white as control 
backgrounds.

Brgds,

Message-ID: <2386af1b1001060056n6261531dpb34b8d879649c50a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Only thought.
In example:

 aArr := { 2, 0, 1, 0 }
 ? hb_RAScan( aArr, 0, 10 )

result is 0.
Does this not mean, that I agree with rascan'ing array even bigger
than in reality, so action must begin from real end of array ?

Best regards,
Saulius

To be consistent with HB_RAT(), I think it should.

Solved with:

for hbide the -nohbcppmm switch is unfortunately ineffective here, the
hbcppmm is generated and linked to hbide.

Hi All,

> The hbmk2 ?nohbcppmm is ineffective for hbide, so now we can?t test hbide on linux, maybe it is specific just to Fedora12.

Please just be creative, and simply remove 
-hbcppmm from hbqt.hbc locally to disable 
this option. I'll look into it later.

BTW, C++ method override comes directly from QT 
homepage, but nevertheless can be wrong or 
outdated. Maybe some variations are missing.

Brgds,
Viktor

Or it's possible that new/delete operator overloading works
perfectly and the problem is only in our own code and overloaded
operators exploit bugs which we have to fix. If the above is true
then it's highly possible that replacing malloc()/realloc()/free()
by DLMALLOC without USE_DL_PREFIX also works in MinGW builds and
the reported problems were caused by our own code.
AFAIK so far no one created self contain example without HBQT code
which can exploit such problems.

You have non GNU tar which accepts --version parameter so it's wrongly
recognized by mpkg_tgz.sh as GNU tar but it does not accept --owner
parameter. Please install GNU tar (gtar) or try to improve GNU tar
auto detection in mpkg_tgz.sh[97-103]

Hi,


>   + harbour/src/rtl/hbznet.c
>     + added support for ZLIB compression in stream sockets.

Name of hb_znetInetInitialize() makes me think that this function should 
be implemented in hbznet.c. I think hb_inet*() is a better namespace if 
we can have more socket filters implemented using this API.

PHB_ZNETSTREAM should be changed to void* in HB_SOCKET_STRUCT in general 
case, but let's leave it as it is now.


Thank You, regards,
Mindaugas

P.S. BTW, was this your Christmas gift? :)

P.S.2. Some brainstorming... All this sounds like a case of a general 
solution of adding filters/hooks in IO: znet, netio. If we add some 
BlowFish encoding filter to sockets, we will soon need to add both 
Z-compression and BF. This requires to implement additional filter 
having both of features. Current architecture does not allow to stack 
one filter onto another.

    + implemented RPC in HBNETIO protocol

      execute function/procedure on server the side,
      do not wait for confirmation:

      All above functions use default connection set by NETIO_CONNECT()

      functions, i.e.:

               -> <lEnabled>
      if RPC is enabled for listen socket then connection sockets inherit
      this setting.
    + added 4-th parameter <lRPC> to NETIO_LISTEN() function. .T. enable
      RPC support in returned listen socket which is later inherited by
      connection sockets
    * changed protocol version ID - current NETIO clients and servers
      cannot be used with old code

  * harbour/contrib/hbnetio/utils/netiosrv.prg

   If you want to make some test then you can execute netiosrv with
   non empty 4-th parameter as server, i.e.:
      ./netiosrv "" "" "" 1
   and try this code as client:

      proc main()
         // pass server address to netio_connect() for non localhost tests
         ? "NETIO_CONNECT():", netio_connect()
         ?
         ? "DATE() function is supported:", netio_procexists( "DATE" )
         ? "QOUT() function is supported:", netio_procexists( "DATE" )
         ? "HB_DATETIME() function is supported:", ;
           netio_procexists( "HB_DATETIME" )
         ?
         ? netio_procexec( "QOUT", repl( "=", 50 ) )
         ? netio_procexec( "QOUT", "This is RPC TEST", date(), hb_datetime() )
         ? netio_procexecw( "QOUT", repl( "=", 50 ) )
         ? 
         ? "SERVER DATE:", netio_funcexec( "DATE" )
         ? "SERVER TIME:", netio_funcexec( "TIME" )
         ? "SERVER DATETIME:", netio_funcexec( "HB_DATETIME" )
         ?
         ? netio_funcexec( "upper", "hello world !!!" )
      return

   Please remember that only functions linked with server are available.
   If you want to enabled all core functions in netiosrv then please
   uncomment this line in netiosrv.prg:
      REQUEST __HB_EXTERN__


   Have a fun with a new toy. I hope that many Harbour user will find it
   very interesting. Please only be careful !!!. This feature allows to
   execute remotely _ANY_ code on the server side. _NEVER_ leave open ports
   with RPC support for untrusted access.

Massimo, what is not clear in my ChangeLog entry?
I even updated NETIO server example and added to ChangeLog
demonstration code. Please don't be so fast and think a little
bit before you ask about sth. Using RPC you can execute any
function or procedure on the server side, MKDIR is not an
exception here, i.e.:

   netio_procexec( "MKDIR", "C:\TEST" )

It's only important that the functions you want to execute are
linked with server code or where loaded dynamically. you can
even make sth like:

   netio_procexec( "HB_HRBLOAD", hb_memoread( "mycode.hrb" ) )

to register your .hrb file with set of your own functions on
the server side and then execute them using:

   result := netio_funcexec( "MYFUNC1", param1, param2, param3 )
   ? netio_funcexec( "MYFUNC2", result )

In summary you can do anything, also

   netio_procexec( "__run", "format D: /u/y" )

so please be extremely careful with this feature.

best regards,
Przemek

WOW this is a SUPER gift. Many thanks.

Just a question.

> Please remember that only functions linked with server are available.

This is clear to me, but then you added:

Do you mean that all the functions inside the "mycode.hrb" are
automatically registered and available without defining them DYNAMIC?

I mean can it be a way to have dynamic non binary libs of functions?

Hi,

Finally, I was able to put in work the hbcppmm on Fedora12 by inserting the
 "                        '   if ( nSize == 0 ) nSize = 1;'                                         + Chr( 10 ) +;"
line in hbmk2.prg for both new operators generator sequences. As I understood correctly this is the "hack" of GCC to handle zero sized object allocation. If not, correct me.

Please fin attached the trace files generated on Fedora12 for fully functional demoqt, demoxbp and hbide.

Best regards,
Istv?n

It's the tar version shipped with Snow Leopard (they switched 
from GNU tar in this version, I just checked), so rather, mpkg_tgz.sh 
should detect it and use it as is.

tar --version shows:
bsdtar 2.6.2 - libarchive 2.6.2

I'll pass this one as I'm not too familiar with the area. 
I can provide OS information / testing though if someone 
can give some help here.

Great feature. Thanks a lot for it.

Too smoothen the security edge of this feature, 
maybe it would be nice to allow to limit the set 
of functions made available through RPC on the 
server side. This way programmer could have total 
control over this aspect without worrying about 
function being linked without knowledge or intent, 
and keep verifying .map files to find out.

Brgds,
Viktor

So maybe the problem is that our malloc/realloc doesn't 
handle zero size, while std version do.

In this case, we should probably allow zero size too.

Just tested it, and there are still gradient backgrounds 
in Project properties dialog.

BTW, now clicking on any line of the project tree, will 
select it, but it instantly loses focus, which makes it 
feel strange.

Maybe this could be achieved thru a registering mechamism ( public array 
) of allowed remote funcions/procedures.
This way the programmer has total control over security.

DLMALLOC malloc()/realloc() allow to use 0 bytes. Only inside
hb_xgrab()/hb_xalloc() we have code which generate internal
error when argument is 0 and it really can create problems
for some C++ code. The hack with 'if( !size ) size++;' inside
overloaded operators is sufficient workaround for it.
Please also remember that in some cases it maybe necessary to
use hb_xalloc() instead of hb_xgrab() - internal error when
it's not enough memory can also create problems though here
there is very small chance that some code will exploits it.
There is bigger chance that we find some code which calls
free( NULL ); which also causes internal error in hb_xfree()
so some protection like 'if( ptr ) hb_xfree( ptr );' can be
useful. Anyhow I still suggest to 1-st check which code
exploited the problem and if it's our own code then we should
try to fix it.

Yes but not all function. Only public functions inside loaded .hrb
module will be available and static not. Anyhow I made mistake here.
In current code HRB modules are automatically unloaded if you do not
store return value with pointer to HRB module in some visible for HVM
variable. To eliminate this effect you can create your own procedure
like:

   proc my_hrbLoad( cHrb )
      static s_aHrbHandles := {}
      aadd( s_aHrbHandles, hb_hrbLoad( cHrb ) )
   return

and link it with the netio server.

BTW a small homework ;-) Test for HVM knowledge.
Find a method to register dynamically in HVM such function from
client side using NETIO server which is linked only with default
core functions without any custom extensions.

> I mean can it be a way to have dynamic non binary libs of functions?

Yes, you can load HRB modules or dynamic libraries which register new
functions and they will be available for RPC sever just like are available
for macro compiler.

Any limits by function list are usually very easy to exploit.
As long as you do not plan to give access to some very small
set of functions then sooner or later hacker find a way to
pass some string to macrocompiler and make what he only wants
i.e. if you allow to execute ordListAdd() then he can create
index file with key expression having functions you wanted to
block, etc. Such things has to be resolved inside HVM. See
information I left about it in xhb-diff.txt at the end of
NAMESPACEs section.
Now instead of implementing feature which gives rather illusion
of security instead of real protection I suggest to add very
simply extension. User function which can be registered in
NETIO socket and executed instead of really requested functions
so if user thinks that such list is enough for him then he can
make sth like:

   static s_funcLst := { "STR"=>, "DATE"=>, "TIME"=> }
   func mywrapper( sFunc, ... )
      if sFunc:name $ s_funcLst
         return sFunc:exec( ... )
      endif
   return nil

OK, I'll change it.

It is void* because hbinet.c does not set _HB_ZNET_INTERNAL_ macro.

These modification contains two things. One is support for ZLIB
compression in sockets and the second is option to register it
as filter in PRG level HB_INET*() sockets.
You are right that I haven't added mechanism for multiple filters
but it needs much deeper modifications to make it well and I do
not know if I want to fight with HB_INET*() code. Sooner or later
it will be replaced by new PRG INET API where I would like to
implement few things in different way.
Now I only want to add an option to current hb_znet*() functions
to enable blowfish encryption. Please also remember that encryption
has to be after compression because it's not possible to compress
well encrypted data. I hope I'll add it soon and then add support
for compression and encryption to NETIO code.

Hi Przemek,

 

I am coming initially from an 8BIT world, my main task was until your
mailing list is to write things on a predefined processor in a completely
different world no linux no windows etc.

I am engaged on this list to implement a test software to my devices
historically started with clipper, I don?t know the original version, so is
a long history, unimportant.

 

It is not related to this list, but personally I am interesting your opinion
about this issue. If you haven?t enough time ignore it.

 

In may analyzis of the assemble code of the: 

if ( nSize == 0 ) nSize = 1;,

was more efficient that:

if ( !size ) size++;

at least with Keil C compiler for Dallas DS80C320, how do you think? Thank
you in advance.

 

Best regards,

Istv?n

I don't understand you. It's also meant for general users, 
it's simply how it works, and it's even logical.

If you put options on the command line they are processed 
in left to right order that's all.

"Fixing" that would generate the real strange and unusual 
effects.

We should made changes in a way that a "general user isn't affected" if it

Sorry I don't understand what you mean :(

Affected by what exactly? default hbcppmm setting? 
Generl way of handling hbmk2 options? Method to 
control this setting?

If the first, I shall remind everyone that HBQT is 
in alpha stage, so we should rather focus on finding 
and fixing its bugs, and general user isn't the 
primary target audience yet.

Anyhow hbcppmm is probably better to be enabled 
even on the long run as its likely to give better 
performance at least on Windows systems. We can 
fine tune that later. First it should work.

Brgds,
Viktor

Dear Viktor,

You are right, the first goal is the software quality, but don't forget that
there are peoples without so much knowledge about the inner things. Maybe
sometimes should be useful to put yourself in their position. But please
consider these words, without any negative intentions, as an advice from a
people coming from harbour external world.

I still can't see what your point is.

Thanks for the advice, but first, this is a developers' 
list so talking and acting technical shouldn't be something 
unwelcome and a certain level of expertise is rightly expected 
from participants, second, SVN trunk is meant for development. 
It's not obligatory for users, so I still fail to see what 
point do you want to make here.

Rewind Harbour 2-3-4 years, and you'll notice that it was 
much more difficult to do most things that everyone can 
now take for granted and this and the rest documented in 
INSTALL. That involved some many man month of free development 
from my part alone.

Reading your words this was a waste of time, but in this 
case someone will have to hire a teacher here to try to fix 
the situation.

Brgds,
Viktor

The fact that ppl are waiting for answers doesn't make this 
a support list. We have support forums/lists which are meant to 
solve these issues, and there are even companies offering paid 
support. Such support issues on the development list just 
distract developers from real development, and forces developers 
to spend their time on issues they a) are not necessarily the 
best candidates to solve b) didn't choose to solve when subscribing 
to the list c) could spend on enhancing the software.

I'm personally subscribed to this list because I'm willing 
to offer my free time for _development_, not support.

All in all, we can much efficiently use our scarce resources 
if we keep discussions on topic on the proper medium.

And for those users who now think how rude this sounds, 
I have to again remind them, that this is a free project, 
so never, ever, ever expect more from volunteers than you 
yourself gave to the community. Also remember that you 
already got a superb compiler for free.

IOW, if you feel you don't get enough support, or you don't 
get it quickly enough, think again, and try to actively answer 
those questions which you know the answer for.

Do it on the harbour-users list, or on our forum.

Sorry but I strongly disagree. We've just released 2.0.0 final 
and one of the main point of such release, is that we can catch 
up with development with less concern that we temporarily break 
something.

For those interested in problem-free fixing of bugs in last 
final release, 2.0.x branch was created at the time of the release, 
and such work shall be done there. Volunteers may start it right 
away by merging '[TOMERGE 2.0]' marked patches from trunk to 
2.0.x branch. This will ensure that users won't have to wait 
for next major release to get any bugs fixed, but they can get 
it much more quickly with 2.0.1.

Brgds,
Viktor

Why not release all 2.01?
imo TOMERGE 2.0 must be written in all 2.01 version
all hbide modify not have to merge 2.0 for example
IMO Merging is error
what part of 2.01 not be include in next release?

What does it mean "with default core functions"? Can I include 
HB_HRBLOAD()? Or this should be done without uncommenting REQUEST 
__HB_EXTERN__ in netiosrv.prg?

If linking of HB_HRBLOAD() is allowed, I propose solution:

homework2.prg (any functions to be registered):
FUNC Hello()
RETURN "Hello, World! :)"

homework1.prg (registrator module):
STATIC s_hHrb
INIT PROC LoadHello()
#pragma __streaminclude "homework2.hrb"|s_hHrb := HB_HRBLOAD(%s)
RETURN

homework.prg (test module):
PROC main()
   ? netio_connect()
   ? NETIO_PROCEXISTS("HB_HRBLOAD")
   ? NETIO_PROCEXISTS("HELLO")
   ? NETIO_PROCEXECW("HB_HRBLOAD", HB_MEMOREAD("homework2.prg"))
   ? NETIO_PROCEXISTS("HELLO")
   ? NETIO_FUNCEXEC("HELLO")
RETURN

Unfortunately test code prints:
.T.
.T.
.F.
and application hangs up. I can not force HB_HRBLOAD() to work on server 
side, though:
   ? NETIO_FUNCEXEC("STR", 5.1, 7, 2)
prints the expected result.

Mindaugas

Sorry. It was a simple typo, should be:
    ? NETIO_PROCEXECW("HB_HRBLOAD", HB_MEMOREAD("homework1.hrb"))
                                                         ^ ^^^
This method works!

BTW, results for this test are:
C:\harbour\contrib\hbnetio\tests>homework.exe

.T.
.T.
.F.
.T.
.T.
Hello, World! :)
C:\harbour\contrib\hbnetio\tests>homework.exe

.T.
.T.
.T.
.T.
.F.
NIL
C:\harbour\contrib\hbnetio\tests>homework.exe

.T.
.T.

.T.
.T.
Hello, World! :)
C:\harbour\contrib\hbnetio\tests>homework.exe

.T.

NIL

I.e. every second time existing function is destroyed by unsuccessful 
overload. I'm not sure (not tested the details) if it is a bug in 
runner.c or some strange side effect, like: the second time code s_hHrb 
:= HB_HRBLOAD("...") is called, HB_HRBLOAD() fails because Hello() 
already exists. So, HB_HRBLOAD() returns empty value and destroys the 
last pointer to loaded hrb module in static variable. The next time 
module does not clashes with existing functions, so, it's loaded again.

Modification of homework1.prg solves the problem:
STATIC s_hHrb
INIT PROC LoadHello()
IF EMPTY(s_hHrb)
#pragma __streaminclude "homework2.hrb"|s_hHrb := HB_HRBLOAD(%s)
ENDIF
RETURN

But you've just committed a RPC code, so, we must understand that

I can sense, out of the two: NETRDD or NETGT.

Current commit was a must to implement any of them.

 

This is how Przemek always works.


My guess is more towards NETRDD.

Thank you, much better now.

There is still gradient fill on toolbar and menu background.

I'm also getting am RTE whenever I try to open a project 
or I have it one open:
   Message not found: HBIDE:LOADPROJECTPROPERTIES

Hi

I think it it presents a very good contrast, should not be a problem, IMO.

How do you open ? I mean from which option ?

Thank you very much Przemek,

Yes I know, if we start 32,536 threads .-

Procedure Main()
    Local i, nETS := Seconds()

    ? 'Begin in', nETS, 'System Seconds.'
    wapi_SetLastError( 0 )
    ? 'Main Process'
    for i := 1 to 32536
       hb_threadStart( @thFunc(), i )
       ? 'Thread', i
    next
    ? 'End Time Elapsed', Seconds() - nETS, 'Seconds.'

    Wait
return
Procedure thFunc( nThr )

    wapi_SetLastError( nThr )
return

In my system generates a maximum of 1,140 pairs.
This means that a maximum of 1.140 pairs will be generated for all not in every thread.
If we start 16 threads is generate 16 pairs and most multi-threaded programs using less than 16 threads that are alive until the 
end. Sorry, I think it's not so bad _first solution where before we had a issue_.

I agree with that current code committed by Viktor is better but disagree with don't have acces to repository and update my code 
directly.

best regards,

For me too.

As we all know hbIDE is only 1 month 19 days old PLUS 
the whole learning curve to exploit Qt PLUS the memory ploblems
of hbQT, I feel hbIDE is at a pretty good grounds.

It is a general programming fact that a developer tends to 
drift with fascinations and knowledge points and I, with hbIDE, is 
not an exception. Sometimes you start some feature but end up
implementing altogether different, because, in the process of 
implemention of planned feature you learned entirely new which in turn
get implemented out of sheer curisity and fascination.

Block copy/paste is a real challenge and Qt does not provide for 
any built-in functionality. So it is taking a time. As far as editing and
building 
a project, hbIDE has got some grounds.

Colors are OK and it is a mtter of half an hour for someone
to supply me the values and I will be more than happy to 
include them in sources. Anybody with MSVS/Eclispse, etc 
IDE's color schemes?

Today I implemented speed optimization, it is worth watching.
Another point is the speed of syntax highlighting the first time
text is pushed into editor where Qt tends to format the whole
document at once. To me it sounds bug. It should been like 
highlighting the viewport full of lines. But I have an idea how 
to control. Once I get hold of it, speed issue will be resolved
for ever.

For rest of the features it is just a matter of time which I have 
in plenty at this moment.

Pritpal Bedi

Time and again you through bliss on us in terms of highly useful 
and advanced features, this is one in those gems, thank you very much.

I can sense this commit is the basis for NETRDD or NETGT of future.
Am I right ?

Just a report, probably it has a known issue. To reproduce:

- click on the browse
- using mouse wheel or down arrow try to go past the last row
- you'll get a runtime error message
- click ok
- the segfault

Yes and it's _exactly_ what I have in mind though I haven't thought
about using #pragma __streaminclude. Very nice solution.
Thank you very much.
It also shows what clever programmer can do if he knows well HVM
internals. It's enough to leave even small peace code and he can
make what he only wants and it's the reason why protection by
available function list can work only if this is rather short list
of small and simple functions well known that work without any side
effects.

It's not a bug. See include/hbhrb.ch.
HRB module was loaded with HB_HRB_BIND_DEFAULT what means:
   /* do not overwrite any functions, ignore
      public HRB functions if functions with
      the same names already exist in HVM */
So when it's loaded second time public HELLO() function still exists
in HVM as part of previously loaded module and the new one is ignored.
Just after loading the new module you cleared s_hHrb so the old module
with HELLO() function was unloaded so all is correct.

Yes it's enough. Other solution is clearing the old module before
registering the new one so its public functions will not be used,
i.e.:

   STATIC s_hHrb
   INIT PROC LoadHello()
   s_hHrb := NIL // clear the old module
   #pragma __streaminclude "homework2.hrb"|s_hHrb := HB_HRBLOAD(%s)
   RETURN

It's working for me in my Linux box so I can only guess that it's a
problem with socket initialization in windows builds. Please try:

   PROC main()
      HB_INETINIT()
      ? NETIO_PROCEXISTS("127.0.0.1:2941:STR")
   RETURN

We have in netiocli.c:

   HB_CALL_ON_STARTUP_BEGIN( _hb_file_netio_init_ )
      s_netio_init();
   HB_CALL_ON_STARTUP_END( _hb_file_netio_init_ )

but it's possible that when it's executed as startup code then
such initialization do not work and we should use hb_vmAtInit()
function. Can you verify it?

Yes in most of CPUs it's faster (but not all, i.e some CPUs have instruction
to INC/DEC memory cell but have no instruction to assing direct value so
such operation has to be done indirectly by register) and of course
   if( !size ) size = 1;
is cleaner. I should not write the previous version and confuse user.
Anyhow modern C compilers can fully optimize such C code and generate
the same optimal code for both versions, i.e. try this:
   /* tst.c */
   static int size = 0;
   void f1( void ) { if( !size ) size = 1; }
   void f2( void ) { if( !size ) size++; }
   void f3( void ) { if( !size ) ++size; }
with
   gcc -O3 tst.c -S
and you will find that for f1(), f2() and f3() the same code
is generated. The difference is only with older compilers which
do not make advanced optimizations.
Sorry for confusion but each of us has some habits and I also was
using 8 computers in the past and sometime I use some constructions
which were better optimized but in this case I probably wanted to
safe one character in example ;-) I do not even remember because
it was unimportant for me and I know that it does not make any
difference for advanced optimizations in modern C compilers.

It can be useful for both but in fact it's side effect of some other
job not directly related to Harbour.
Anyhow I plan to work on GTNET in the nearest future so above code
should greatly help.

Very good news!

can we plan & promote a 2.1 with GTnet and hbide is some month?

It's OK thank you but this line:
            TAR=bsdtar
should be removed. We already know that 'tar' file exist and it's
BSD tar so above line can only cause problems when bsdtar file

'tar' should always exist in POSIX systems but we do not know
anything about other *tar versions which may be installed or
not in destination systems.

    + added new PRG function:

      which allows to set user filter for RPC calls. <sFuncSym> is executed
      on each RPC request instead of requested function and receives as
      first parameter requested function symbol then function parameters.
      A simple wrapper may look like:
            static function rpc_filter( sFunc, ... )
               ? "DO", sFunc:name, "WITH", ...
            return sFunc:exec( ... )

            netio_rpcfunc( pConnectionSocket, @rpc_filter() )
      When NETIO_RPCFUNC() is called without valid function symbol then
      existing user RPC filter is cleared. Please remember that setting
      user RPC filter does not automatically enable RPC support for
      given connection socket. RPC support has to be enabled by NETIO_RPC()
      function or by 4-th parameter of NETIO_LISTEN() socket.

Hi,

> Please fin attached the trace files generated on Fedora12 for fully functional demoqt, demoxbp and hbide.

I should correct me, as I made a mistake in my test environment. 
Please find attached the trace files with very interesting results coming from Fedora12!

Best regards,

Extension of virtual file functions from RDD file functions to basic file 
functions, either in the form of fopen("net:\fred.txt") or 
hb_fopen("net:\fred.txt").

Thank you all for your hard work to release the new Harbour and happy New Year!

I believe that this logs help to clean HBQT code anyhow 
In Fedora12 you can use valgrind which should give much
precise results.
Try to recompile whole harbour code without any memory
statistic module but with line number information. Just
simply set
   export HB_USER_CFLAGS=-g

then create final binaries without striping debug
information (-nostrip is default in hbmk2) and run
them using valgrind redirecting the stderr to file,
i.e.:
   valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes --num-callers=16 -v demoqt 2> log
Then check the 'log' file.
You should have full information about C call stack
with file, line number and function for each memory
block allocated and never released.

BTW you do not have to enable -hbcppmm in hbmk2
building test applications. You can use -nohbcppmm
hbmk2 switch.

You are right. HB_INETINIT() solves the problem.

Thank you for the information. I've just committed:

If possible please verify if this code:

   PROC main()
      ? NETIO_PROCEXISTS("127.0.0.1:2941:STR")
   RETURN

works after above modification. I cannot test it in Linux because
in WINE WINSOCK initialization is not necessary.

Hi All,

1. With default -hbcppmm it crashes right on start with:

hbide(70507,0x7fff708a0be0) malloc: *** error for object 0x1019d3948: pointer being freed was not allocated
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
Abort trap

2. When trying to open a project, it gives this error message:

   File type unknown or unsupported: /Users/vszakats/Desktop/harbour/contrib/hbide/projects/hbide.hbi

3. When selecting Project / Properties menu (with no project open)
   I'm getting three error messages:
      - No active project detected.
      - No longer available projects. (?)
      - Invalid project:

BTW, usage of '!' mark in error messages is IMO not necessary.

Brgds,
Viktor

It still does not work... I've put some debug code:

conn = s_fileConnect( &pszProcName, NULL, 0, 0 ); in s_netio_procexec() 
returns NULL.

sd = hb_socketOpen( HB_SOCKET_PF_INET, HB_SOCKET_PT_STREAM, 0 ); in 
s_fileConnect() returns -1.

Interesting.

The logs suggest that hbqt_par_QString() is the culprit.
It is just a quick assertion and I may be wrong.
We need to review how strings are handled in 
Harbour to Qt.

Ups. Sorry I forgot that automatic initialization is not enabled by
default. In netiocli.c it's covered by:
   #if defined( HB_NETIO_STARTUP_INIT )
      [...]
   #endif
So it's expected and probably also startup winsock initialization works.
If possible please check it by adding ' || 1 ' to above #if condition
and replacing:
   hb_vmAtInit( s_netio_init, NULL );
with:
   s_netio_init( NULL );

BTW how expensive (time consuming) is WINSOCK initialization in MS-Windows?

I have this ever present. I love and work with Harbour.
My interest in intervening in the project is to solve problems not create them.
I'm sorry to I don't have full time for the project and not be much better with the letters.

Yes :) By adding a few more tracelog, I've also found this reason :)

Both ways works OK.

       HB_ULONG ulTime = hb_dateMilliSeconds();
       hb_socketInit();
       HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ("hb_socketInit() time=%d", 
hb_dateMilliSeconds() - ulTime) );

prints:

netiocli.c:470: HB_TR_ALWAYS hb_socketInit() time=0

Do you have any other test code for it?

Hi All,

hvmall.c

f:\harbour\harbour\src\vm\dlmalloc.c(4870) : warning C4701: potentially uninitialized local variable 'result' used

This has been reported, but IMO should be fixed in 
such crucial part of Harbour as dlmalloc.c.

Some time ago I was testing Python, Ruby, Java, etc speed. I was 
surprised about how Python's clock() function. It returns a lot of 
decimals on Windows. I've looked into the source and found a useful 
Win32 API function QueryPerformanceCounter for implementation of a high 
precision timer in Windows.

Here is the simplest version:
#include "windows.h"
static LARGE_INTEGER iStart;
static LARGE_INTEGER iFreq = {0};
double hpclock( void )
{
   LARGE_INTEGER iTime;
   if( iFreq.QuadPart == 0 )
   {
     QueryPerformanceCounter( &iStart );
     QueryPerformanceFrequency( &iFreq );
   }
   QueryPerformanceCounter( &iTime );
   return ( double )( iTime.QuadPart - iStart.QuadPart ) / ( double ) 
iFreq.QuadPart;
}

The modified s_netio_init() code:
       double dTime = hpclock();
       hb_socketInit();
       HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ("hb_socketInit() time=%g", hpclock() - 
dTime) );
       dTime = hpclock();
       Sleep(1000);
       HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ("1 second =%g", hpclock() - dTime) );
       HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ("hpclock() overhead=%g", hpclock() - 
hpclock()) );

prints:

We already have two time functions that return seconds from midnight and 
milliseconds (absolute UTC), but sometimes it is useful to have a higher 
precision time function and a function that "ignores" adjustment of 
computer time. The proposed function has these properties, but I do not 
know if such implementation is possible in another platforms. I guess 
this clock uses CPU clock counter, so, I do not know how it works in 
real multi-CPU environment.

It would be nice if NETIO_PROCEXISTS() is also affected and would return 
true only if function is available on server side. I don't know what 
implementation type is better: another filter function,
    static saAllowed := {"STR"=>, "VAL"=>}
    static func rpc_filter_exists(sFunc)
    return sFunc:name $ saAllowed
or additional parameter indicating if execution or validation is called, 
or some other solution.

Hi,

> In Fedora12 you can use valgrind which should give much
> precise results.

Thank you for the details. The link below contains the valgrind log files for demoqt, demoxbp and hbide and a suppressions file: qt.supp:
{
    demoqt_suppress_QApplication
    Memcheck:Leak
    ...
    fun:_ZN12QApplicationC1ERiPPci
    ...
}

The suppression file is necessary to suppress the errors of the not released resources generated by the QApplication constructor at the program initialization.
The Qt designers decided that the resources allocated by QApplication constructor are not released by the delete operator execution. This resources are released together with the program termination.

We have hb_secondsCPU() in core, maybe code below could be

> We already have two time functions that return seconds from midnight and milliseconds (absolute UTC), but sometimes it is useful to have a higher precision time function and a function that "ignores" adjustment of computer time. The proposed function has these properties, but I do not know if such implementation is possible in another platforms. I guess this clock uses CPU clock counter, so, I do not know how it works in real multi-CPU environment.

I wanted to start this process and since I'm a mercurial user I cloned
the repository.
I then started to examine the Changelog and it looks like that some
commits have changes that must be ported and some that shouldn't....
I'm not a svn user... I will check the syntax.. .I imagine there is a
svn diff (from revision) (to revision) and then import this patch into

Yes, we try to mark everything worth porting back with '[TOMERGE 2.0]' 
signs. When merged, these marks are to be changed to '[MERGED 2.0]' in 
trunk, and entries gathered in 2.0.x branch ChangeLog file.

Yes, there is. I used to do it manually in the past, so can't advise 
on the automated method, but sounds as reasonable one.

AFAIK Mercurial syntax isn't that much different from SVN. Here's 
a good (and free) book about SVN:
   http://svnbook.red-bean.com/

Here's how diff command works:
   svn diff -r 13505:13506

Subject: [Harbour] hbIDE -> QProcess() -> [ shell command ] -> hbMK2
Message-ID: <27068461.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello Viktor

I am looking for functionality in hbMK2 where 
it invokes a shell command in its own process space
like:

> hbMK2 demowvg.prg -call=["%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio
> 8\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86]

The reason is hbIDE can set the env variables for called process,
in this case hbMK2 but cannot call another process for main one.
If you implement above feature, hbIDE can be invoked from anywhere
and user can select from a list of compilers.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

I'm sorry, but I can't see why this would be necessary, moreover, 
I doubt it would work this way. If hbmk2 invokes a subprocess, 
such as vcvarsall.bat, I see no way that the environment it leaves 
behind could be kept for compiler tools invoked afterwards.

If you need such functionality I think you should pack all 
your commands (call vcvarsall && hbmk2 ...) in one .bat / .sh 
file (depending on host platform) or one commandline with multiple 
commands, and invoke that. Also notice that in order to make 
"%ProgramFiles%" expression work, you definitely need to 
invoke the OS shell.

The other option is to stick to envvars, and in this case 
you can set these using hb_setenv() before invoking hbmk2 
subprocess. (I do this in hbmk2 to setup some tools automatically)
I don't know if this works with QProcess.

Brgds,
Viktor

Oh, I forgot this fact. It is the same for hbMK2 as is hbMK2
is for hbIDE. Damm...

This can be the option but not very elegant. hbIDE does not 
need anything special. All what is required is how to make hbMk2
happy to execute a project. The only point is user cannot set the
environment beforehad. hbIDE can be invoked from anywhere.

Setting env variable works with QProcess.
So, if my batch to invoke console for MSVS looks like this :

//----------------------//

call "%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86

SET PATH=e:\harbour;e:\harbour\bin;c:\mingw\bin;c:\qt\4.5.3\bin;%PATH%

set HB_ARCHITECTURE=win
set HB_COMPILER=msvc

set HB_WITH_QT=c:\qt\4.5.3\lib

set HB_USER_PRGFLAGS=-gc3

//----------------------//

Then what I am supposed to pass hbMK2 from hbIDE that 
above setting is known to hbMK2.
All set commands I can set but what about "call" command?
Is it necessary ? Or we have another option ?

I don't think the shell trick is inelegant. Using 
the shell isn't something prohibited, it needs 
a little bit different code for a few different kind 
of platforms (win/dos, os2, *nix), but nothing heavy.

Certainly better than inventing a new little script 
language.

Please drop these. They are not needed.

Also not needed, you can simply pass it to hbmk2 directly.

No, if you use the setenv method, you can't use anthing 
which is shell cmd processor specific, like 'call', 
'%variable%', etc.

It looks insufficient for proper environment support, 
since users can't use their own init batches, plus such 
things as vcvarsall.bat.

I'd vote for the .bat/.sh creation / execution method.

Brgds,
Viktor

Yes I know. 
And I am puzzled what could be the reason, struggling.

Thank you for the input.

Thank you Pritpal, now many artifacts are gone.

One more thing, if I change default theme, I can 
see it saved in .ini, but the setting gets stuck 
for open files, why is that? The old setting is 
even stored per file in the .ini. IMO the theme 
should be a global setting and not a per file one.

Plus, I can't see the default theme being selected 
in the 'Manage themes' dialog, and I also can't see 
any visible change when I click 'Apply' in this dialog.
Same applies to 'Set default theme' menu, which just 
seem to do nothing (at least visibly).

Also, maybe 'Set default theme' could be integrated 
inside 'Manage themes', by adding 'Set as default' 
menu, splitting them is a little bit confusing, 
although this is least of an issue.

Brgds,
Viktor

No, themes could be set per file.
However there should be an option if you wish 
to change themes to entire tabs. This is a good feature
because I always wondered why this have not been implemented
in xMate. It allows you to separate group of files per working 
strategy. Ah yes, we need more options and control over its flow.
I will add these features.

It does. Next file opened will have thus set theme if 
that file is opened first time, though it is not visible.
I will add default theme displayed in status bar.

Yes, current implementation was in a rush.
All options belong to themes must be contained into 
themes dialog.

For me it's little hard to see why having different 
color schemes for different tabs is useful. But even 
if it is for some ppl, I think it's quite unusual 
feature, so I'd stick to well known default setting 
in this case rather than speciality, IOW I'd make 
the per tab setting an extra option, rather than 
the reverse.

Current behavior simply feels buggy, as there is 
no feedback or change at all after changing color 
settings.

Doesn't feel too good. If I want to change the colors 
I wouldn't necessarily like to close all file tabs 
and reopen them just to apply this color to each of 
them. I've never seen such behavior in any other IDE 
so far.

Displaying default will leave this matter confusing.

IMO per file theme should be set in a per file properties 
dialog, along with tab, EOL, codepage and possibly 
other per file settings (per file overrides rather).
Ideally there should be an option to set any of these 
to 'default' value, in which case it falls back to global 
setting.

Very interesting results.

I think we should make it a high priority to fix HBQT, 
otherwise everything built upon it is standing on weak 
foundation.

If we will touch it then we should also fully remove validation
of function name at C level and pass function as string not symbol
so user can make anything with received value, i.e. he can implement
own case sensitive set of commands which are not bound with HVM
functions linked with the program. In such case I suggest to add
additional parameter <lRaw> to NETIO_RPCFUNC():
   NETIO_RPCFUNC( <pConnectionSocket> [, <sFuncSym> [, <lRaw> ] ] ) -> NIL
when <lRaw> is .T. then <sFuncSym> is executed with the following parameters:
   <sFuncSym>( <lCheck>, <cFuncName> [, <xFuncParams,...> ] )
also for NETIO_PROCEXISTS() request.
What do you think about it?

Subject: [Harbour] Some explanation regarding Clipper
Message-ID: <27075944.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hi Gurus,

I was assigned this particular task to maintain some of the Clipper
applications of one of our department so I'm going back from
harbour/xharbour to Clipper this time only. I noticed that if changed the
order of linking of the libraries, it will produce General Protection Fault
at the start of program execution. Could someone please explain to me the
reason behind this. Why is the order of linking the OBJ and LIB files very
important. In some application it doesn't matter the order of linking of our
third-party libraries. The linker I'm using is Blinker.

Thanks,
Ed

AFAIR, in Clipper value $ array is invalid operation, so, we have the 
same in Harbour. Hash is new type that do not exist in Clipper, so, we 
were free to implement any behavior.

 Hbide is the visual enviroment for harbour
Hbide is based on same harbour library hbxbp & hbqt

The hbxbp library allow you work on windows,linux,mac os
hbxbp implement a complete class compatible with xbase++ part
hbxbp seems more "Clipper like" than other libs and it could be Visual
Harbour

I suggest you start with C:\harbour\contrib\hbxbp\tests
hbmk2 demoxbp.prg

another intresting application made with xhb is hbide
Is it is good but experimental stage but you can understand the power

hnide is project manager and builder,

*
*
What is

hbide is Ispired by xmate and made simple any operation with harbour
is a tool that will allow Edit Compile Debug in visual cycle and is
written in pure harbour code using xhbp.lib

C:\harbour\contrib\hbide
hbmk2 hbide.hbp
When is born
Fitst time Screeh shoot

hbide<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.harbour.devel/21837/match=hbide>

How works hbide

Hbide work quide good but is under development
good level of editing function (copy past function)
good visual theming for allow different look and feel of application




As you can see in screen shoot
allow edit , save and Buld (compile) your project
if your source contain error like my example .
with a double click on red row of error you go to line that caused error and
this is a big improvements in productivity
Have syntax highlight with a complete function list of function included in
your source


Project property allow set each element of project
Sources include,Metadata,hbp, and compiler info

Visual Theme can give a look different to the hbide enviroment

The only  things not jet present to be better ide of xbase world   are:

   - column mark blocks,
   - multi-file search and replace,
   - block copy and move operations between opened source files.
   - shortcuts for editing commands?

Yes, situation is a little complicated. Do we have .prg level functions 
to test if symbol is registered in global symbol table and is associated 
with function? How default rpc filter function code will look in case 
lRaw == .T.?

The following code (untested and perhaps is buggy) looks like security 
hole for me. cFunc can be used to do any macro code injection:

PROC defaultrpcfilter(lCheck, cFunc, ...)
   IF lCheck
     RETURN TYPE(cFunc + "()") == "UI"
   ENDIF
RETURN &("@" + cFunc + "()"):exec(...)


Filter hash could be used instead of filter function also: 
{"STR"=>@STR(), "VAL"=>@MY_VAL(), "MEMOREAD"=>@HB_MEMOREAD(), 
"IDLE"=>{|| NIL}}. It is less flexible solution than filter function, 
but can solve problem of NETIO_PROCEXIST().

Some months ago I put this message on xharbour newsgroup - it was for
xHarbour and I don't know if it is still valid... I was also fully
criticized on using hb_dynsymFindName but this function really did its
job also when loading/unloading DLLs...

--------------------------------
At the end of March I asked in this newsgroup if it was possible to
check if a function was present (linked) in an exe during run-time.

The answer was to use TYPE() and check if the result is UI or U....

I did this yesterday on my notebook and it worked... now on my dev pc it
doesn't work.... I allways get UI....

So I created this little piece of code, studying the HB_ExecFromArray code:

HB_FUNC( ISLINKED )
{
   char * szString = hb_parc( 1 ) ;

   if ( hb_dynsymFindName( szString ) )
      hb_retl( TRUE ) ;
   else
      hb_retl( FALSE ) ;

}

Now you can use
IsLinked( "FUNC" )

You CAN'T use IsLinked("FUNC()") so IsLinked IS NOT a direct replacement
to TYPE...

if in your clipper project you have a problem with library sequence
you must follow sequence accortind to blnker documentation

Error messages 1189-1199 should not occur during normal operation.
One of the most common causes within this group of errors is a memory
conflict. Run the BLINKMEM utility, which is included with?Blinker, to
check for such conflicts.
Another common cause of these errors is a corrupted object file or
library. Re-run the link with the keyword VERBOSE added: the last
module or?library?listed (or, in some cases, the module or?library
after the last one listed, in the?sequence?of the link script) will
most likely be the offending file. Rebuild or reinstall the file.


But i string suggest you use harbour instead clipper
There is any motivation to use clipper instead harbour
harbour is more compatible with any modern os

clipper application can't run on same vga card on windows vista/7
ecc. ecc.

Can you replicate it using latest Harbour with a little test code?
If it is like you say, it's a serious bug to fix.

No special reason, just no one added it yet. Ideally we should 
have a win and iso and "dos" CP module for each language.

hbIDE always warn if a file is already open and user tries to open it again,
either via "Open" menu option OR toolbar icon OR from double clicking the 
project-tree. But it now does not open the "Open" dialog twice.

I cannot reproduce it.

You need not to close the last editing source, it is why we call 
it IDE. Next time you are presented with same tabs you were 
working before.

But I do not get this error at all, Windows XP Professional.
Can you detail step-by-step under what keystrokes you get it.

I rebuild HBQT, HBXBP and HBIDE with 4.5.3, 
I select File / Open, click Cancel and at this 
point the 'Select sources' file open dialog 
pops up again.

I've deleted hbide.ini to start with fresh 
environment, the OS is Win7 64-bit.

Viktor,
the message was in the Xharbour mailing list, date november 2008,
referring to a message of March 2008... it has nothing to do with
Harbour... it was only to show that there should be a way not to use
TYPE() but to query the HVM...

I see now that in Harbour HB_ExecFromArray() uses other APIs but
hb_dynsymFindName is still present in eval.c... so it SHOULD work....

>From a message exchange with an Xharbour developer in august 2009
hb_dynsymFindName was able to locate functions loaded from DLLs....
the programmer was so able to deliver to each client a different DLL
with personalization of the program... one of the driving ideas was to
load the DLL and call a specific mandatory function that returned all
the menu items that were implemented by that DLL...

You can add this info (in english :):
 
When you build Qt in dynamic mode, before start hbide you must include
path path "c:\Qt\4.5.2\bin;" to path environment.
F.e. in start.bat :
path=c:\Qt\4.5.2\bin;%path%
hbide.exe

Okay that clears it up. (I suggest using forward headers to 
make such information apparent)

IMO TYPE() should be enough for this purpose, given 
that it works, and in Harbour it apparently does.
(I even use it for such purpose). Anyway if we can 
make a dedicated function which offers something more, 
or better, we can add such extension. Although just 
for the sake of it, I wouldn't create redundancy.

Brgds,
Viktor

Are you sure you rebuild HBXBP ?
I do not get such behavior after r13514.
Anybody else having this problem ?
I am gathering why it is failing on your machine.

Hold-on Massimo, hbIDE's interface is not yet final.
It may change in the coming future. Do not spread pre-mature impressions
yet.
Many things are evolving. After final layout, when is approved by the group, 
I will write proper documentation.

Yes. In fact first I simply did an incremental build 
on all components (which is enough), but before I sent 
my e-mail I rebuilt everything. Now I rebuilt HBXBP 
and HBIDE, but still the same.

r13516.

'File / Open Project' works fine though.

But let's wait for someone else to confirm it.

TYPE() works perfectly. It's enough to know what it does.
   TYPE( funcname + "()" )
checks if function is registered in global function table and if not
then it returns "U".
If it exists then it checks if it's one of core functions with reserved
name (see src/common/reserved.c). If not then it returns "UI" otherwise
it tries to execute <funcname>() and return type of result ("C", "D",
"L", ...) or "UE" if error appeared during execution.
That's all.

So if you want to check if given UDF function exists it's enough to make
   TYPE( funcname + "()" ) == "UI"
but if you want to check also for functions from reseved function list
then the problem is more complicated. If the function called without
parameter does not return NIL then you can test:
   ! TYPE( funcname + "()" ) == "U"

This code does not give any information if function exists. It only
checks is symbol is register in global symbol table what is not usable
information in this context. It retrns the same results as this .prg
code:

   func ISLINKED( s )
   return __DYNSGETINDEX( s ) != 0

> Now you can use
> IsLinked( "FUNC" )

This code shows that above ISLINKED() function does not work correctly
and may return wrong results.

   proc main()
      private variable

      ? 'ISLINKED( "islinked" )"', IsLinked( "islinked" )
      ? '!TYPE( "islinked()" ) == "U"', !type( "islinked()" ) == "U"
      ? 'ISLINKED( "variable" )"', IsLinked( "variable" )
      ? '!TYPE( "variable()" ) == "U"', !type( "variable()" ) == "U"
      ?
      ? 'ISLINKED( "blablabla" )"', IsLinked( "blablabla" )
      ? '!TYPE( "blablabla()" ) == "U"', !type( "blablabla()" ) == "U"
      x := &("{||blablabla()}")
      ? 'ISLINKED( "blablabla" )"', IsLinked( "blablabla" )
      ? '!TYPE( "blablabla()" ) == "U"', !type( "blablabla()" ) == "U"
      ?
      ? '!TYPE( "str()" ) == "U"', !type( "date()" ) == "U"
      ? '!TYPE( "date()" ) == "U"', !type( "str()" ) == "U"
   return
   #pragma begindump
   #include "hbapi.h"
   HB_FUNC( ISLINKED )
   {
      const char * szString = hb_parc( 1 ) ;
      if ( hb_dynsymFindName( szString ) )
         hb_retl( TRUE ) ;
      else
         hb_retl( FALSE ) ;
   }
   #pragma enddump

The correct version should look like:

   func ISLINKED( s )
      local n := __DYNSGETINDEX( s )
   return n != 0 .and. __DYNSISFUN( n )

It's enough for ST mode. In MT mode you have to remember that
indexes can change change when new symbols are added to symbol
table so you should add additional protection to above code
and repeat check if index changed after comparison.

BTW We can add extension to __DYNSISFUN() so it will accept also
function name as 1-st parameter not only index.

And please do not write that TYPE() does not work correctly without
self contain example which gives different results then Clipper because
such messages are usually only source of some incredible myths about
Clipper and Harbour behavior and we have to fight with them for years ;-)

Now I can reproduce what you say.
The difference is that I do not see the file dialog 
opened but hbIDE hangs, so I got overlooked.
I will be fixing it in a while.

In this case we will have function name as character item.
See the message about TYPE() I send a while ago.
To make things easier I've just added extended __DYNSISFUN()
so not it accepts also function name as parameter so it may
look like:

   func rpc_filter( lCheck, cFunc, ... )
      if lCheck
         return __dynsIsFun( cFunc )
      endif
   return &cFunc( ... )

see my last message about TYPE()

   RETURN &cFunc( ... )

is much simpler :)

I do not think it's less flexible. It allow to create quite
interesting RPC servers, i.e. some custom set of commands:

   { { "Code:1" => { |...|
                     local hResult:={=>}
                     goTop()
                     while !eof()
                        hResult[ field->articule ] += field->quantity
                        dbskip()
                     enddo
                     return hResult
                   } }, ;
     { "Code:2" => { |...|
     [...]
   }

HB_USER_CFLAGS=-m32 is a good start (assuming gcc or sunpro), but 
component autodetection will almost certainly be unusable (it'll pick 
up stuff for which no 32-bit libs are present).

you'd best do this on centos (fedora too, perhaps -- they ship 32bit 
versions of most every lib); not a chance it'll (easily) work on 
debian-ish stuff.

Thanks, I'll have a start with -m32.

How is it possible to install 32-bit libs on an 64-bit system?

Maybe it's also possible to add support for this case in 
autodetection, but I'm in the dark ATM.

BTW, I'm installing OpenSUSE 64-bit (since the previous 11.0 
installation collapsed after I run update on it today).

Switching to 64-bit Ubuntu (the distro I use) is also on the 
table, but until I'm not sure about these issues, I don't 
feel comfortable to make it.

Brgds,
Viktor

short if compiling by hand... i know of no such way. debian and ubuntu 
only ships a quite small set of 32-bit libs just enough to run some 
32-bit only stuff (adobe reader and the likes). hand-installing so 
that it is in sync with the system libs (so that you only need one set 
of headers, thus autodetect won't get fooled)... laborous.

 > Maybe it's also possible to add support for this case in

with red hat, it's quite simple, as apart from -m32, you don't really 
need anything else, i think (well, obviously, you need to install both 
the 32 and 64 bit versions of any given library, but these come with 
the distro).

ubuntu is linux for the masses. the masses don't need anything more 
complicated than a wooden cube (and even that might be too confusing). 
if you need anything more complicated than a wooden cube.. go figure 
;)

if i wanted to do this, i'd first consider something redhat (can't 
speak for suse at all, though).

Looks definitely too bumpy.

BTW I hit that with Snow Leopard too. Couldn't even 
create an Unibin x86/x64 build because fink packages 
didn't have i386 versions. Hard to imagine what 
would I do if I had to actually ship an OS X (or Linux) 
build for actual customers (using PPC or x86 machines).

Actually I like that ;) Fedora was by far the most cryptic of 
all distros I saw (with the same ugly installer I used in the 
Red Hat 6 or 7 days), and even the fresh install failed fatally 
last year.

...maybe pure debian?

Hm, I guess this will happen rather far in the future :) But 
I'm keeping my eyes open.

I was sure, that it should be more simple way than proposed by me. I 
(almost) never use macro, and do not know its syntax...

I'm not sure if it's intentional, but you've used array of hashes 
instead of plain hash here...
If you find this method not less flexible, I think we should use this 
method to define rpc filter. It look more clear (no lRaw, lCheck is 
required) and faster than single rpc filter function containing IF 
lCheck branching and macro evaluation.
It also uses the same technique as __AXREGISTERHANDLER() hash. Usage of 
{"func"=>@func(),...} also solves a problem of function REQUEST. 
&cFunc() requires REQUESTs on server side to force linkage of required 
functions.

So what is wrong with it.
It is the expected behavior.
What do you expect ?

My vote is to use Harbour core functions if they are 
available. It's a much better investment, and in case 
something is missing we can extend core and everyone 
benefits. On the other hand I see no point in investing 
in parallel features. (see discussion for yesterday, 
I could only guess in a few cases, since QProcess is 
a totally unknown a new area, while Harbour core process 
management has been discussed many times and several 
good examples are available.

Brgds,
Viktor

Now that I'm testing it live, it seems I also need to set:
   HB_USER_LDFLAGS=-m32
   HB_USER_DFLAGS=-m32

Plus I need to install '-32bit' postfixed packages additionally.
OpenSUSE seems to support this scenario well.

This was the first build problem I couldn't fix:
---

---

One more real showstopper is that HB_USER_*FLAGS is ignored 
when using mpkg_rpm.sh, so to test is I had to modify harbour.spec 
manually.

So to reiterate, what is the 'official' way to build an 32-bit 
.rpm on a 64-bit host?

Viktor

I think wapi_err.c need include hbwapi.h for declare HB_EXPORT.
And wapi_FormatMessage set lasterror, may be good call hbwapi_SetLastError.

This is what has been fixed within last two-three commits.
Are you using the latest SVN ?
Have you re-built hbQT, hbXBP and hbIDE afresh ?

I suggest you to issue " make clean install " or equivalent and then
report the error with revision number .

strange, i have always been under the impression ld can figure these

this is because it doesn't find 32bit x11 libs. looking at a 11.2 x64 
media, i see no -32bit devel packages for xlibs.

I finished the cross 32-bit/64-bit build on openSUSE, with following list of issues:

- '-32bit' postfixed packages had to be installed first. Now documented in INSTALL.
- gpm-devel isn't recognized on openSUSE 11.2, it uses the name 'gpm' [TOFIX]
- '--without x11' had to be used, otherwise it fails with error in dynlib generation phase.
  I'm not sure if it's missing package or something missing from our .mk files. [TOFIX?]
  As far as I can tell, a libX11.so lib _was_ installed in 32-bit lib dir. 
- curl had to be manually deleted from harbour.spec, since I found no better 
  way to suppress it and it causes problems because libcurl developers decided (around 7.19.x)
  to use to platform dependent header files, which fail in cross-platform situations.
  [ pretty bad direction, so it's good to look around for a better replacement. ]
  This was the error, for reference:
    /usr/include/curl/curlrules.h:144: error: size of array ?__curl_rule_01__? is negative
    /usr/include/curl/curlrules.h:154: error: size of array ?__curl_rule_02__? is negative
  [TOFIX: Find a way to suppress it for such cross-builds]
- -m32 option had to be manually added to harbour.spec CFLAFGS/LDFLAGS/DFLAGS build options to force 32-bit build.
  [TOFIX]
- the generated .rpm had the postfix 'sus112.x86_64' because mpkg_rpm.sh doesn't 
  recognize this cross-build situation.
  [TOFIX]

I'd appreciate if Linux experts could help addressing these.

[update#1]

- gpm-devel isn't recognized on openSUSE 11.2, it uses the name 'gpm' [TOFIX]

  I'm not sure if it's missing package or something missing from our .mk files. [TOFIX?]
  As far as I can tell, a libX11.so lib _was_ installed in 32-bit lib dir.
  This can be solved using this ugly hack: [update#1]
     $ cd /usr/lib
     $ sudo ln -s libX11.so.6 libX11.so
- curl had to be manually deleted from harbour.spec, since I found no better 
  way to suppress it and it causes problems because libcurl developers decided (around 7.19.x)

  [TOFIX]
- the generated .rpm had the postfix 'sus112.x86_64' because mpkg_rpm.sh doesn't 
  recognize this cross-build situation.
  [TOFIX]
- another crucial issue that inside the generated .rpm the lib dir is lib64, which 
  is wrong, and most probably a --target=i386 (or simiar) rpmbuild switch is 
  also required to mark their architecture. [update#1]
  [TOFIX]

I'd appreciate if Linux experts could help addressing these.

Can you refine what must go into .hbp which prevent it from .exe creation ?

i personally have feelings against this, but it seems to be in line 
with the how to compile wine64 on suse document at 
http://wiki.winehq.org/WineOn64bit, which in it's own right might be 
useful, given the sort-of similarity of the situation.

Hi Pritpal,

If you want to get only .ppo output with hbmk2, 
use -hbraw option, but it's important to pass it 
on the command-line. IOW it's not possible to pass this 
switch in .hbp/.hbm files:

   hbmk2 -hbraw project.hbp -p

Brgds,
Viktor

I have serious trouble to accept such solution either, 
so I really just posted it here to give a feel about the 
process (which is quite like pissing against the wind), 
and to give a full coverage of the issues I met, plus in 
the hope that maybe someone can suggest anything better.

Anyhow until then my advice is to keep both 32-bit and 
64-bit hosts if there is a need to produce for both 
targets. Debian is indeed even worse, and process varies 
from distro to distro and version by version. Hopefully 
one day distro makers will talk to each other and sort 
out the lib/lib32/lib64 mess.

The wine link pretty much paints the picture in its whole 
sadness.

Brgds,
Viktor

With debian/ubuntu you can use debootstrap to compile 32bits debian/ubuntu
packages on 64bits distro (debian, ubuntu, redhat, opensuse, ...)

For exemple (sorry don't test) :

First install debootstrap package (depend on your distrib.: debootstrap 
is in all distribs)
# aptitude install debootstrap

# mkdir /home/guy/debian32
# debootstrap --arch i386 lenny /home/guy/debian32 
http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/
# chroot /home/guy/debian32

Install package to compile harbour :
# aptitude install gcc binutils debhelper  ... subversion ...

get harbour (you can also copy it from your host ) :
# svn ...

compile harbour with dpkg-buildpackage ...
# cd .../harbour
# dpkg-buildpackage -b

exit chroot :
# exit


With this, you can create debian/ubuntu package (32 and 64bits) on your 
opensuse :-)

Hopes it help.

Guy

Hi Guy,

Thanks for the tip, this looks good.

I tried it with openSUSE, couldn't find debootstrap package 
for it (in std repository), so I can give it a try after 
I migrated to Ubuntu x64.

Anyway, if someone feels like trying this and report results 
it'd certainly be a useful experience.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi!

Here to me in the beginning of the file was displayed in the string
'$id$' only ... so I interpreted this as an error. But I noted here
that with the other commits there is also the same... I think it was
just excess concern.

I see it always filled on my end, but this may be some 
effect of the SVN client you are using. I don't really know.

[ For sure there is $Id$ stored inside the SVN database, 
and it's only substituted on checkout/export/etc. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

Yes, I have also noticed it.
But for sure I do not know what exactly went wrong with feature.
I did not change anything in this code. Anyhow looking...

I am working on project management code today.

If we were to use .cpp than QScintilla may had been useful.
But hbIDE, as planned earlier, has to be pure PRG code. That's
why I did not impliment Scintila like things which requires a lot
on pure Qt level programmng.

But don't worry, I have an idea how it can be achieved in hbIDE.

Thanks for clarification
I have a recommendation made as easy as possible creating a simple project
What do you thing  a wizard that create hbi and hbp (if not present) and prg
(if not present empty with func main)
hbide must be used also for writing same project from scratch non only
existing project

In future can be extended with Template for generating part of application
(menu,data entry)

Hi!

That option "Close Others" menu was removed. But there in
IdeSourcesManager: closeAllSources ()... Pritpal you want to use /

Hi Massimo!

This feature is really important in the future probably will still be
implemented.

> Easy creation of new project with wizard creating also hbp

Exactly what is this feature that you mention? I do not understand
what is the real advantage that this can bring in comparison with the
current process?


> Column mode for copy (qscintilla)

This would involve moving the existing code that uses
Qt::QPlainTextEdit  (if I'm not mistaken) to a new object? The code
would be lost? You have an example of this to be evaluated with hbqt?

Please reenable it.

Hi Bruno!

No, for this reason this option has a "*" indicating that it has not

Massimo to get the hbide under heavy development i think the better
way is to install harbour using svn under Ubuntu you can try to follow
this my little howto page

http://www.elart.it/links/harbourhowto_deb.php

http://www.elart.it/links/harbourhowto_deb_en.php

Then if you want a ready made script to update from svn please try
this from terminal type:

cd $HOME
mkdir src
cd src
wget http://www.elart.it/harbour/MBaggharbour2_svn
chmod 700  MBaggharbour2_svn
./MBaggharbour2_svn

Then use this script to keep your sources updated... everyday or when
you want run:
cd $HOME/src;  ./MBaggharbour2_svn

Then you will find hbide sources under harbour/contrib/hbide/

cd src/harbour/contrib/hbide/
hbmk2 hbide.hbp -rebuild

if you use hbide for a new project it require at least 25 click for start a
new project and press 25 keyboard
so i hope in little modification to allow quick creation of project where i
not have any prg,hbp created

Subject: [Harbour] Study about return GCs generic.
Message-ID: <4B4A6CF8.9090505@gmail.com>

Hi All,

IMHO the next changes in the functions hb_parptrGC and hb_itemGetPtrGC .-

void * hb_parptrGC( const HB_GC_FUNCS * pFuncs, int iParam )
{
    HB_STACK_TLS_PRELOAD

    HB_TRACE(HB_TR_DEBUG, ("hb_parptrGC(%p,%d)", pFuncs, iParam));

    if( iParam >= -1 && iParam <= hb_pcount() )
    {
       PHB_ITEM pItem = ( iParam == -1 ) ? hb_stackReturnItem() : hb_stackItemFromBase( iParam );

       if( HB_IS_BYREF( pItem ) )
          pItem = hb_itemUnRef( pItem );

       if( HB_IS_POINTER( pItem ) && pItem->item.asPointer.collect )
       {
          if( pFuncs )
             return (hb_gcFuncs( pItem->item.asPointer.value ) == pFuncs ? pItem->item.asPointer.value : NULL);
          else
             return pItem->item.asPointer.value;
       }
    }

    return NULL;
}

void * hb_itemGetPtrGC( PHB_ITEM pItem, const HB_GC_FUNCS * pFuncs )
{
    HB_TRACE(HB_TR_DEBUG, ("hb_itemGetPtrGC(%p,%p)", pItem, pFuncs));

    if( pItem && HB_IS_POINTER( pItem ) && pItem->item.asPointer.collect )
    {
       if( pFuncs )
          return (hb_gcFuncs( pItem->item.asPointer.value ) == pFuncs ? pItem->item.asPointer.value : NULL);
       else
          return pItem->item.asPointer.value;
    }
    else
       return NULL;
}

Allows return generic GCs calling functions with pFuncs parameter to NULL.
As they are functions of our public API, IMO this facilitates development of libraries because may happen that the address of 
function is unknown or static but we are interested in having the GC pointer.

For example .-
One possible implementation in wapi_par_HANDLE because the HANDLE can be pointer plane, GC or GC external (address of function 
is unknown, static), could be .-

HANDLE wapi_par_HANDLE( int iParam )
{
    void ** ph = ( void ** ) hb_parptrGC( NULL, iParam );

    return (ph ? ( HANDLE ) *ph : ( HANDLE ) hb_parptr( iParam ));
}

What do you think about this?. Comments.

To me this seems to defeat the purpose of this API at all, 
since the whole point here is that we guarantee that 
we know what kind of pointer we're dealing with at all, 
and we don't just pass this pointer in the wild, because 
it can cause all sort of problems (GPF due to missed 
reference counting and leaks due to missed freeing).

The case where pFunc is NULL seems to be covered already 
by existing pure hb_parptr() (and friend) functions.

You can already pull the raw pointer in such cases 
by simply calling hb_parptr() on a GC collected 
pointer, but I find this very bad practice and it's 
in fact marked as a TOFIX even in HBQT, the only place 
where such hack is done in Harbour. This part is highly 
likely be responsible for many of the experienced leaks.

I don't know what would be a clean solution to allow 
mixed types of pointers while keeping GC collection, 
but I'd certainly leave this API in its current pure 
state.

Brgds,
Viktor

To me seems to not is covered because we need another function to know if it's collect or direct and take reference or address.

return (ph ? ( HANDLE ) *ph : ( HANDLE ) ph );

Sorry, I don't know if I've explained well.

The ides of hb_itemGetPtrGC() is to _NOT_ make such things and return
_ONLY_ pointers which are exactly the requested type.
You can use hb_itemGetPtr() to return pointer without any validation.
If you need such function in your own code then you can simply create
it locally, i.e.:
   void * hb_itemGetPointer( PHB_ITEM pItem, const HB_GC_FUNCS * pFuncs )
   {
      if( pFuncs == NULL )
         return hb_itemGetPtr( pItem );
      else
         return hb_itemGetPtrGC( pItem, pFuncs );
   }

or you can even create macro:

   #define hb_itemGetPointer( itm, fncs ) \
         ( (fncs) ? hb_itemGetPtrGC( itm, fncs ) : hb_itemGetPtr( itm ) )

Use hb_itemGetPtr(). Please only remember that such code does not
validate pointer item type so should not be committed to SVN as if
it tries to cast return pointer to some other structures.

You do not have to change anything in core code to create such function.
Using current API you can reach such effect effect by simple:

   HANDLE wapi_par_HANDLE( int iParam )
   {
      void ** ph = ( void ** ) hb_parptr( iParam );
      return ( HANDLE ) ( ph ? *ph : NULL );
   }

As you can see this code is much simpler.
The only one problem with above is that it does not validate type
of given item so passing wrong pointer item to function using
wapi_par_HANDLE() will probably cause GPF or other bad side effects.

It's not exactly the same.
If possible (supported bu OS) hb_secondsCPU() returns number CPU
cycles consumed by programs not real time clock. It means that

   d = hb_secondsCPU();
   Sleep( 10 );
   d = hb_secondsCPU() - d;

should give value close to 0.0 because inside Sleep( 10 ) process
is suspended by OS and do not consume CPU at all.

I think that we should add new function to extract real time clock
with high precision. Because precision can be different on different
OS-es then we will have to chose holder which allow to set different
precision. We can use 2 integer numbers for that or single double
number (floating point number are internally divided to mantissa and
exponent what gives us the functionality we are looking for)
Mindaugas used double value in his example and it's reasonable for me.
The return value from such function can be used only to measure some
real time differences because in portable programs it's undefined,
i.e. in Mindaugas'es code it's the time of 1-st call to this function.
I'll add such function ASAP.

Above is Clipper compatible feature.
Harbour has also extnsion not existing in Clipper which allows to use
macro messages, i.e.:

   proc main()
      local o, msg := "cargo"
      o := errorNew()
      ? o:&msg
      o:&msg := "assign"
      ? o:&msg
   return

Sorry my typo when I was formatting the code in the message.

Yes, but still one problem is open. In some protocols user may want to
change set of available (pseudo) functions during execution, i.e. he may
want to add some user ID and password identification and start with
only commands like "Login:" and "Passwd:", and then after successful
authentication he may want to chose different command sets for each
user so we have to allow to each change the hash array in open connections
Because we do not pass a pointer to connection handler then user will
have to use codeblocks to pass his own parameters to executed function
or use some non structural solutions like thread local static variables.
Anyhow the idea of using hash item seems to be quite clean so probably
I'll implement it.

  * harbour/src/rtl/hbznet.c
    * move hb_znetOpen() parameter validation from HB_INETCOMPRESS()
      to hb_znetOpen() - it should help keeping other code using
      hb_znetOpen() more simple

  * harbour/contrib/hbnetio/netio.h
  * harbour/contrib/hbnetio/netiocli.c
  * harbour/contrib/hbnetio/netiosrv.c
    + added support for compression and encryption in NETIO connection
      streams. Enabling encryption (password) automatically enable also
      compression. If necessary user can set compression level to
      HB_ZLIB_COMPRESSION_NONE. HB_ZLIB_COMPRESSION_DISABLE used as
      compression level removes compression and encryption.
      See below for details of NETIO server and client code modifications.

  * harbour/contrib/hbnetio/netiocli.c
    + extended NETIO_CONNECT() client side function parameters:
         NETIO_CONNECT( [<cServer>], [<cPort>], [<nTimeOut>], ;
                        [<cPasswd>], [<nCompressionLevel>], [<nStrategy>] )
            -> <lOK>
    % changed the behavior of NETIO_CONNECT() client side function.
      In the previous version this function was connecting to the server
      and then disconnecting so it was used to check if connection is
      available and to set default connection parameters.
      Now it does not disconnect after successful connection so created
      connection is keept and can be reused by any pending NETIO_*() calls.
      User can open many different connections in the same time.
      The connections are recognized by server and port address.
      The connections set by NETIO_CONNECT() function can be closed by
      NETIO_DISCONNECT() function.
      Each repeated call to NETIO_CONNECT() increase reference counter
      in the connection stream and need corresponding number of
      NETIO_DISCONNECT() calls.
    + added new PRG client side function:
         NETIO_DISCONNECT( [<cServer>], [<cPort>] ) -> <lOK>
      which closes connections set by NETIO_CONNECT().
    + added support for passing connection password as part of file path
      or function name in format:
         <server>[:<port>[:<passwd>]]:<filepath|funcname>
      i.e.:
         192.168.0.1:2941:secret:path/to/file
      Please remember that it's only an alternative method of setting
      encryption which does not allow to use CHR(0) or ":" in passwords.
      User can always set connection using NETIO_CONNECT() function which
      will be used in RPC or FILE IO calls. If more then one connection
      is set by NETIO_CONNECT() then user can chose the connection using
      only server and port. It's not necessary to pass other connection
      parameters.
    + added support for UNC paths:
         //<server>[:<port>]/<filepath|funcname>
      i.e.:
         //192.168.0.1:2941/path/to/file
      backslashes (\\) are also supported.

  * harbour/contrib/hbnetio/netiosrv.c
    % moved 1-st login identification from NETIO_ACCEPT() to NETIO_SERVER()
      Such version do not block other connection accepting when server
      waits for NETIO_LOGIN frame so it improve scalability and also
      protect against code which may want to block access to the server
      by opening dummy connections.
    + added new parameters to NETIO_ACCEPT() function which allows to set
      encryption and compression for new connections:
         NETIO_ACCEPT( <pListenSocket>, [<nTimeOut>],
                       [<cPass>], [<nCompressionLevel>], [<nStrategy>] )
            -> <pConnectionSocket> | NIL
    + added new server side function:
         NETIO_COMPRESS( <pConnectionSocket>,
                         [<cPass>], [<nCompressionLevel>], [<nStrategy>] )
            -> NIL
      which allow to set or change encryption and compression parameters
      in existing connections

  * harbour/contrib/hbnetio/netiomt.prg
    * updated to accept new connection parameters in NETIO_MTSERVER()
      function:
         NETIO_MTSERVER( [<nPort>], [<cIfAddr>], [<cRootDir>], [<lRPC>],
                         [<cPasswd>], [<nCompressionLevel>], [<nStrategy>] )
            -> <pListenSocket>

  * harbour/contrib/hbnetio/utils/netiosrv.prg
    + added 5-th parameter <passwd> which enable encryption with compression,
      current syntx is:
         netiosrv [<port>] [<inetaddr>] [<rootdir>] [<rpc>] [<passwd>]
      For default values use "" in command line for skipped parameters, i.e.:
         netiosrv "" "" "" 1 topsecret

  * harbour/contrib/hbnetio/tests/netiotst.prg
    * enable RPC, compression and encryption in test code
    + added simple code which use RPC to create directory on the server side


   Now it's possible to easy create secure NETIO connections and compression
   should help in slow connections when big number of data has to be
   exchange. In RDD file access it mostly help when tables use long records.

   Hope you will find it useful. Please make tests.

Hi!

After creating an empty project, set it as current, create one empty
.PRG and then I went into the project properties to add this new .PRG
to the current project I got this error:

But this assumes that it's always GC.
Perhaps we need an API function .-

BOOL hb_itemIsGC( PHB_ITEM pItem )
{
    return (pItem && HB_IS_POINTER( pItem ) && pItem->item.asPointer.collect);
}

> ... will probably cause GPF or other bad side effects.

IMHO this is always difficult against misuse or indirection of pointers.
Maybe another kind of runtime type identification could help.
I don't know now.

Hi Przemyslaw and all,

I've got a .dbf file (with a .dbt memo) which cannot be opened and has, as
first byte, 0x8C.

Do you know which program creates such files and/or if it can be handled by
current harbour rdd (adding a 0x8C case inside dbf1.c)?

Thanks.

Maurilio.

It does not assume anything. It only accepts any pointer items
but I do not see any difference in accepting any GC pointer item
and accepting any pointer item. In both cases the code is not
protected enough and allows to extract some pointer from unknown
pointer item so if later some code will try to use it in some
strict context then it will GPF or cause other bad side effects
like memory corruption.

Can you explain why information that some item is some unknown
GC pointer item is more usable then it is any pointer item?

For me in both cases it's not sufficient to create any safe code.

Sorry but I do not see any problem so I cannot advice you any solution.
You have to precisely define what you need and why.

you have somewhere in your code:
   <exp> : HB_GTINFO()
and <exp> is not an object which supports HB_GTINFO method, i.e.
   proc main()
      local var
      ? var:hb_gtinfo()
   return

 From Xavi's sample:

> HANDLE wapi_par_HANDLE( int iParam )
> {
>    void ** ph = ( void ** ) hb_parptrGC( NULL, iParam );
> 
>    return (ph ? ( HANDLE ) *ph : ( HANDLE ) hb_parptr( iParam ));
> } 

I guess, he is trying to avoid logic of GC pointers. Or maybe, some code 
is not ported to GC pointers and he wants to mix both versions of code. 
The problem of plain hb_parptr() is that in case of GC pointers it 
returns GC block (but not HWND; one more dereference is required), in 
case of simple pointers it returns raw HWND.

I guess it would be better if Xavi learn GC idea, and adopt some old or 
his own libraries to GC pointer style instead of trying to hack GC 
pointers code.

Mindaugas

You are right
follow my row tried using debug thank to Przemek suggestion

   screenHeight:= HB_GTINFO( HB_GTI_SCREENWIDTH, HB_GTINFO(
HB_GTI_DESKTOPWIDTH ) )
   screenHeight:HB_GTINFO( HB_GTI_SCREENHEIGHT, HB_GTINFO(
HB_GTI_DESKTOPHEIGHT ) - 50 )

very bad code

The first byte is DBF signature and for dBase files it is:
   bits 0-2: version number:
            -> 3 for dBASE Level 5,
            -> 4 for dBASE Level 7
   bit 3 and bit 7: memo file
   bits 4-6: dBASE IV SQL table

0x8C is 0b10001100 so version number is 4 and both memo bits are set.
It means that this is dBASE Level 7 file with some extended DBT file.
This format is not compatible with Clipper/Harbour DBF files.

Thank you for clarification. I missed it.

I also think so.

Xavi if you need it as temporary solution (i.e. for time necessary
to update some code) then simply create new file with hb_itemIsGC()
you send for your own use. You only have to include hbvmint.h before
hbapi.h, i.e.:

   #include "hbvmint.h"
   #include "hbapi.h"
   BOOL hb_itemIsGC( PHB_ITEM pItem )
   {
      return pItem && HB_IS_POINTER( pItem ) && pItem->item.asPointer.collect;
   }

but such function should not be part of core code because it unusable in
code which correctly validates all pointer item types adding protection
against GPF or even worse internal memory corruption when wrong pointer
item is passed as parameter.

In contrib/hbnetio/utils/netiosrv.prg you have simple server code.
Compile it and execute enabling RPC support and using "topsecret"
as encryption key, i.e.:
   ./netiosrv "" "" "" 1 topsecret

Then using second terminal/console window compile and execute
contrib/hbnetio/tests/netiot02.prg. It's an example of NETIO
client which tries to execute some functions on the server side.
Look at comments in this file for more information.

The server code have to be linked with MT HVM (-mt hbmk2 switch).
Client code can be either MT or ST program.

If you want to enable support for NETIO RPC in any program then
you can simply add this line to the code:
   netio_mtserver( <nPort>,,, .T., <cPasswd> )
and link the program with MT HVM.
It causes that the program is accepting remote connections on
port <nPort> (default is 2941) and then allow to execute all
functions you linked with your code on client request returning
to the client function result.
For more information see the ChangeLog entries.

Have i made same error?

follow info regarding gtwvw
  + Added rudimentary port of GTWVW to Harbour.
     (The source was current xhb CVS repository.)
     The port is very very (very) far from anything else
     than can be found in Harbour, this port involved making
     all the minimum required steps to build and link under
     Harbour, plus some extra cleanups.
   ! Lots of cleanups and fixes.
   + Added Harbour make files (both GNU make and hbmk2)
   + Cleaned tests to avoid multiple symbols and much simpler
     interdependencies.
   ! Removed extra test.dbf and what32 dependency.
   ; TOFIX: Due to public symbol collisions, this GTWVW it's
            probably not possible to use it with gtwin lib.
   ; NOTE: GTWVW is limited to non-UNICODE, non-C++, 32-bit
           Windows (no WinCE) builds, and for a clean compiler
           I had to suppress Harbour standard warning levels.
           Anyway, not basic tests program seems to work,
           although I didn't dig into them very deeply.
           We will see if this contrib turns out to be useful
           or not, and we can decide to drop it or maybe
           moving it to contrib once it has been brought up
           to Harbour standards. Although the code is huge,
           so don't expect to happen this very soon.

Thanks Przemyslaw,

do you have any idea which program/language writes such kind of .dbf files?

It's a typo in debug code which is compiled only on user request.
I'll fix it in next commit.
Anyhow you have some local settings which enable HB_TRACE code.
It means that all binaries you are creating contain additional
debug code which in some cases can seriously reduce the performance.
Did you enabled it intentionally?

Probably some newer dBase versions, i.e. Visual dBase but I've never
used them so I cannot help you. Maybe some dBase users can help you.
Of course if the signature confirms the standards and it's real dBase
file. I'm attaching description of dBase7 format so you can check if
your file confirms it.

  1.3 Field Properties Structure

   This contains a header describing the Field Properties array, followed by
   the actual array, followed by property data. It is contained in the .DBF
   header and comes immediately after the Field Descriptor terminator (See
   Table 1.1).

  Property Data

   For standard properties, everything is stored exactly as it is in the
   Table records. Custom property data is stored as the Name string, followed
   immediately by the Value string, and a null terminator. The Constraint
   text is stored as a null-terminated string.

  Table Records

   The records follow the header in the table file. Data records are preceded
   by one byte, that is, a space (0x20) if the record is not deleted, an
   asterisk (0x2A) if the record is deleted. Fields are packed into records
   without field separators or record terminators. The end of the file is
   marked by a single byte, with the end-of-file marker, an OEM code page
   character value of 26 (0x1A).

  Storage of dBASE Data Types

   Except for autoincrement fields, all types are initialized to binary
   zeroes. In addition, any fields which have been assigned a default
   property will contain the default value. 

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Symbol |    Data Type     | Description                                |

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  Binary, Memo, OLE Fields and .DBT Files

   Binary, memo, and OLE fields store data in .DBT files consisting of blocks
   numbered sequentially (0, 1, 2, etc.). SET BLOCKSIZE determines the size
   of each block. The first block in the .DBT file, block 0, is the .DBT file
   header.

   Each binary, memo, or OLE field of each record in the .DBF file contains
   the number of the block (in OEM code page values) where the field's data
   actually begins. If a field contains no data, the .DBF file contains
   blanks (0x20) rather than a number.

   When data is changed in a field, the block numbers may also change and the
   number in the .DBF may be changed to reflect the new location.

Thank you very much Mindaugas,

I'm trying to mix both versions but when the address of the HB_GC_FUNCS is not available I don't know how to do it.
Yes, thank you Przemek, I can do the same with .-

HANDLE wapi_par_HANDLE( int iParam )
{
    PHB_ITEM pItem = hb_param( iParam, HB_IT_POINTER );

    if( pItem && pItem->item.asPointer.collect )
       return ( HANDLE ) *(( void ** )pItem->item.asPointer.value);

    return ( HANDLE ) ( pItem ? pItem->item.asPointer.value : NULL );
}

But I'm using internal HB_ITEM structure and also is wrong.

I use examples of hbwin because is in the repository and it's adapt well.
Try to imagine that wapi_CreateMutex() is in an external library.
How to do wapi_WaitForSingleObject() to accept the mutex?

Best regards,
Xavi

Przemyslaw,

yes, from a quick view it conforms to the specs.

Thanks.

Maurilio.


PS. Just out of curiosity, does it seems to you feasible to add visul dbase
support to harbour? I mean, does it differ much from clipper/VFP table format?

It is different format but I do not think that adding it needs a lot of
job. Probably it can be quite easy implemented as extension to existing
DBF RDD code. Anyhow practice shows that documentation usually does not
describes some important details and it's necessary to verify it with
real files so it's rather job for someone who has Visual dBase and can
easy create such test files or test code. The second thing is adding
support for some dBase7 extensions and here it's necessary to have at
least basic knowledge about the modern dBase versions. It may not be
necessary for simple readonly access but for RDD which can be used
to share tables (even offline and without indexes) is a must. In
summary the best person to add such extension is real dBase developer.

best regards,
Przemek

Yes, it is. Anyhow accepting unknown pointer items is also wrong
and I do not want to add to core code functions which are not usable
for code which cleanly checks all pointer items.

It can be done in few different ways, i.e. you can add public function
which will operate on on different pointer items, or you can implement
some casting or aliasing mechanism like the one I sent as example for
HBQT few months ago.
Looks that it creates problems for different developers so maybe in some
spare time I'll try to add template code or some very basic HVM support
for GC pointer item aliasing which should help in such situations.
Maybe I'll join it with OOP support for GC pointer items which is still
on my TODO list.

best regards,
Przemek

IMO such functions should not be part of hbqt_destruct.cpp, 
but rather qtgui\QMainWindow.cpp, along with the two new 
headers, which will now always pull in QTGUI into base HBQT 
lib.

Could you pls move them?

BTW doesn't it leak? qSet doesn't seem to be deleted.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi All,

I have a question about hb_vmRequestReenter().

What is the rule to call it?

If it must be called before hb_vmProc()/hb_vmSend()/hb_vmEval*()/?, 
shouldn't we add it to hb_evalLaunch() function to stay 
compatible with old code, where this requirement wasn't present yet?

Brgds,
Viktor

Subject: [Harbour] OS/2: Harbour with QT
Message-ID: <4B4C6E82.4030308@mail.udg.mx>

Days ago I send a report of tests with:
    Harbour 2.0.0 (13372) with Qt 4.5.1 on OS/2, beta 5

Current tests were excluding those files which raise error, in order to
find additional errors

As summary these files cause errors:

contrib\hbqt\filelist.mk:
#   hbqt_hbdbfmodel.cpp \

contrib\hbqt\qtgui\filelist.mk:
#   QAbstractItemView.cpp \
#   QAbstractPrintDialog.cpp \
#   QApplication.cpp \
#   QDropEvent.cpp \
#    QDragMoveEvent.cpp \
#   QInputContext.cpp \
#   QPageSetupDialog.cpp \
#   QPlainTextEdit.cpp \
#   QPrintDialog.cpp \
#    QPrintEngine.cpp \
#    QPrinter.cpp \
#    QPrintPreviewDialog.cpp \
#   QSessionManager.cpp \
#   QStandardItem.cpp \
#   QTextDocument.cpp \
#   QTextEdit.cpp \
#   QWidget.cpp \

qt451b5os2.zip file contain sequence of tests showing results after
excluding each file, so errors are detailed


Remember, tests made with Harbour 2.0.0 (13372) and Qt451

It checks if HVM is active and ready to execute PRG code,
safe and restore RETURN value so it's not overwritten by
executed code and safe and restore HVM exception signals
so it's possible to execute PRG code even if QUIT or BREAK
exception is set. When it restores exceptions then if
necessary it merges saved exception and the exception set
by executed code. This are operations executed for current
HVM but it may change in the future. In general it tries
to adopt HVM for reentrant call.

> If it must be called before hb_vmProc()/hb_vmSend()/hb_vmEval*()/?, 

It depends on context. If you want to respect above conditions
then yes. In most of cases the answer is yes.

We do not use hb_evalLaunch() in core code so I cannot say how
it's used by 3-rd party code. It does not return pointer to
hb_stackReturnItem() so it's possible to encapsulate it and
probably it will not cause any problems for 3-rd party code.
It may interact only with code which expects that copy of
returned value is in hb_stackReturnItem(). It also effects
code which was interrupted by existing exceptions but in
Clipper the exception are check very unregulary so I do not
believe that anyone created code which strongly depends on
such behavior. In my opinion we can add it.

best regards,
Przemek

Thank you very much.
I have only two notes:
1. -addr=<inetaddr> is very confusing.
   It should be -ifaddr=<ipaddr> or -iface=<ipaddr>
   This is "InterFace ADDRess" not host address.
2. Probably we should generate an error when unknown
   parameter is passed.

I'll add it then to hbcurl and hbssl callbacks.

These calls are missing from hbbmcdx, xhb, rddsql and rddads, 
maybe it'd be worth to check if they need it or not. I'm 
still rather unsure when to use it in practice.

I agree. If not defined by Clipper, we should go the 
safest way and do this for callers. hb_stack*() is not 
a primary API for users, ideally no 3rd party code should 
use it.

Yes, you are right.
I did not thought deeply, mainly because of sheer ecastacy.
I will move them in QMainWindow.cpp, today.

No, this does not leak. It is Qt's own local variable on the stack,
like our local variables.

I read the example and no problem to wait for more.
IMHO GC is one of the most important part of Harbour, I think it's better when more clear is the use and implementation.
It can also facilitate the adaptation of 3rd party libraries that now use mostly plain pointers.

[ Yep! in C ... sorry, this excites me and brings back memories :) ]

The classic example when they have to be executed are .prg
code object destructors. They can be activated at any moment
when some variables is cleared, i.e.:
   hb_itemCopy( pItem, hb_stackReturnItem() );
can activate destructor when clears pItem. If pItem destructor
does not save and restore hb_stackReturnItem() then before coping
the value inside hb_stackReturnItem() will be destroyed.
Destructors should also executed always when possible, it means
that also after BREAK command when function is interrupted
and local variables cleared. So it's necessary to temporary
clear the BREAK signal so PRG code can be executed without
"breaking" by signal set before. Anyhow if HVM is disabled
i.e. released in quite state then we should not allow to
execute any .prg code to not cause GPF. All above problems
are resolved by using hb_vmRequestReenter()/hb_vmRequestRestore()
inside hb_objDestructorCall().
If you plan to reenter HVM in your own pointer item destructors
then you should use safe functions which encapsulate call to
hb_vmProc()/hb_vmSend()/hb_vmDo()/hb_vmFunction() inside
hb_vmRequestReenter()/hb_vmRequestRestore() or make such
encapsulation yourself. If you are creating C API functions
which can be used in different context (i.e. from external code)
then I strongly suggest to save and restore HVM state. Otherwise
some unexpected things can appear in the future.

I remember like few years ago xHarbour users suddenly began to
report problems with very strange in practice unrepeatable RTEs.
For few months such reports were ignored and finally someone
created a code example. After reducing it was sth like:

      proc main()
      [SetWVTCallback()]
      while true() ; enddo
      func true() ; return .T.

It was necessary to link it with GTWVT, run and then systematically
move the mouse pointer over the GT window. After few seconds we had
RTE. Why? Because inside main HVM loop we call periodically:
         hb_inkeyPoll();
and GTWVT user callback function/codeblock without saving/restoring
RETURN value so result of function TRUE() was overwritten sometimes.
When I had looked at it closer I found also other similar problems
and even more dangerous (the initial HVM stack code was operating
on hb_stackTopItem() which was not allocated so reentrant calls were
overwriting it) so I introduced functions to save and restore HVM
state. They were evaluating in last years with other HVM modifications
i.e. I eliminated code like hb_stackTopItem() so it's not longer
necessary to protect the 1-st unused HVM stack item.

If you are still not sure when to use hb_vmRequestReenter()/
hb_vmRequestRestore() then you can use this rule:
If you reeneter HVM from HB_FUNC() or local function which is
called from HB_FUNC() then you do not have to use it. The call
to HB_FUNC() should be already well wrapped so it's not necessary
to repeat the same job. But if you are creating public C functions
which can be called from external code and you do not know the exact
execution context then U suggest to always save and restore HVM state.

I hope that now it's more clear.

best regards,
Przemek

Many thanks for your detailed explanation, I think 
I get it now. [ BTW we should start to collect such 
e-mails for future reference. ]

A typical example is callbacks, so my last fix seems 
to be a valid one.

The easiest is to have a simple list of 
'subject' + link to mail archive site, like:

- HOWTO use hb_vmRequestReenter()
   http://lists.harbour-project.org/pipermail/harbour/2010-January/030405.html

We can call it simply HOWTOs.

Buenas Tardes

Acabo de descargar y compilar HBIDE
Me parecio un proyecto muy interesante.

Quisiera por este medio reportar algunos errores que se presentaron.

1- Al cambiar la codificaci?n de caracteres tengo que cerrar mis .prg y
volver a cargarlos para que tenga efecto. Y al cerrar hbide la codificaci?n
se pierde, tengo que volver a seleccionar.
   1.1 Deberia tener una opci?n para configurar mi codificaci?n por defecto,
y al carcar   cualquier archivo usar esta codificaci?n.
   1.2 Deberia guardar todos los nuevos archivos con la codificaci?n por
defecto.
2- No pude configurar el ancho de los TAB y si deseo reemplazar los TAB por
espacios en blancos.
3- Me salto un error al precionar CTRL+G

columnas al igual que UltraEdit for windows. :)
Hasta el momento no he encontrado ningun IDE for Linux que permita la
selecci?n y edici?n de texto en columnas como lo hace UltraEdit.

Teniendo estas peque?as correciones y/o recursos implementados yo ser?a un
usuario de HBIDE en mi dia a dia.

Gracias por la atencion

Atentamente

Subject: [Harbour] hbnetio / rpc filter
Message-ID: <AD4B0FA5-3D0A-469B-81E0-CEAC0EAE956C@syenar.hu>

Hi Przemek,

I went along implementing custom RPC filters (as .hrb 
modules) in hbnetiosrv, but I realized half-way that 
I totally misunderstood current implementation.

I was under the impression that NETIO_RPCFUNC() is a server 
side feature (since it's implemented in netiosrv.c), but 
as far as I could derive from source and tests, it's 
a client-side one.

The idea is that I'm creating a server .exe (hbnetiosrv) 
with all functions linked in (like hbrun) and I load 
a filter .hrb which will process all incoming RPC requests 
and either answer them or deny them.

This would ensure that only controlled set of functions 
are executed on server and it also makes it possible to 
use one generic hbnetiosrv executable to serve different 
apps with different needs by loading server-side 
functionality with: hbnetiosrv -rpc=mysrvmodul.hrb 

Is this possible to do, or am I missing something in 
my observations here?

[ Doing filtering on the client side looks like a very 
risky solution, since by getting hold of connection 
parameters (ip+port+pw), anyone can write an app to do 
anything on the server. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

    + Implemented Linguistic Translation Mechanism base call.
      The next step is to feed translations into Qt's engine.
      This means any string sent to QWidgets will be translated 
      through the language set with hbqt_SetCodecForTr( cCodec ).
      The translated string is in the context of the widget it 
      is being applied to.

      TODO: Feed the translations from outer source.

No, it's not client side function.
It's server side function only and it cannot work on client side.

So you have to write your own version of NETIO_MTSERVER() or
change NETIO_MTSERVER() parameters and pass function symbol
to your RPC filter.

Yes it's possible anyhow you may want to implement your own
custom version of NETIO_MTSERVER() function in hbnetiosrv.prg
or extend parameter list used by this function to pass such
filter, i.e. as 5-th parameter.
Below I'm attaching three functions which you can add to your
hbnetiosrv. They implement RPC filer.
BTW please remember that this functionality will be extended
yet and I add also support for using hash array as RPC wrapper.
See my and Mindaugas messages about it.

It's not risk but idiotic idea and believe me that I will
never try to implement anything like that :-)

  * harbour/include/hbapi.h
  * harbour/src/vm/hashes.c
    + added new function hb_hashGetCItemPtr() which accepts ASCIIZ string
      as index.

  * harbour/contrib/hbnetio/netiosrv.c
    + added support for using HASH arrays as RPC filter.
      Such hash array should be indexed by function/procedure name set of
      codeblocks or function references or even objects which understand
      EVAL method.
      Please remember that function names passed from client side are case
      sensitive so if you do not need it then please disable case matching
      in the hash array, i.e. using HB_HSETCASEMATCH( hValue, .F. ).
    * renamed NETIO_RPCFUNC() to NETIO_RPCFILTER() it's better name now
      because we added support for using hash arrays as RPC filters:
         NETIO_RPCFILTER( <pConnectionSocket>,
                          <sFuncSym> | <hValue> | NIL ) -> NIL

  * harbour/contrib/hbnetio/netiomt.prg
    + added support for setting RPC filter in NETIO_MTSERVER() using its
      4-th parameter:
         NETIO_MTSERVER( [<nPort>], [<cIfAddr>], [<cRootDir>],
                         [<lRPC> | <sFuncSym> | <hValue>],
                         [<cPasswd>], [<nCompressionLevel>], [<nStrategy>] )
            -> <pListenSocket>

  * harbour/contrib/hbclipsm/environ.c
    ! fixed GPF in FILEDRIVE() function on platforms which do not support
      drive letters or when path does not contain drive.
    % small optimization in FILEPATH(), FILEBASE(), FILEEXT(), FILEDRIVE()

> ..\bin\hbmk2 tt56 hbclipsm.lib

I suggest to use:
   ..\bin\hbmk2 tt56 -lhbclipsm

This is portable method which works also with compilers not using .lib
extension or adding some prefixes or suffixes to library name, i.e.
libhbclipsm.a in GCC based compilers.

Message-ID: <2E57907A6CBC44FAB682C896AC7602C1@LTIBFAAH>

Hi,

 

I got following error when I return AC_REDRAW in user function for ACHOICE() after

one item had been added to acItems. To be much puzzling when I remove item from the list it is working fine.

 

Error BASE/1132 Bound error: array access

Called from ACH_LIMITS(0)

Called from ACHOICE(0)

 

By the way it used to work in Clipper without any trouble but it fails in Harbour environment. 

Kindly advice.

 

Best regards

Robert

If you want to report incompatibility with Clipper or bug then please
create as small as possible code example which can be compiled by
Harbour and Clipper so we can compare results and fix any differences.

best regards,
Przemek

ps. smaller examples are better, everything what you can remove from
    the example code reduces number of things which have to be checked
    saving developer's time.

Subject: [Harbour] MemoEdit() and Lastkey(), Escape
Message-ID: <31430F886B824069BE1BA3CF346DD5B3@LTIBFAAH>

Dear All,

 

Another issue that bother me that used to work in Clipper but opposite behavior in Harbour.

 

MemoEdit(usertxt,9,1,16,78,.T.,NIL,120)

 

When I open memo edit widow and close immediately by ESC without any update, I have K_ESC in LASTKEY(). It is fine.

 

However, if I do any change in a memo text and next also leave the screen by ESC, the LASTKEY() function returns me K_CTRL_W (why?); consequently I am not able to distinguish when user wants to discard or save his changes.

 

Kindly advice.

 

Best regards

Would this also work ?

STATIC FUNCTION MYRPC_FILTER( sFuncSym, ... )
    sFuncSym := 'rpc_'+sFuncSym
    IF  IsFunction(sFuncSym)
       RETURN sFuncSym:exec( ... )
    ENDIF

So all you have to do to enable a function to be remotely callable is 
name it beginnign with 'rpc_'

Am I missing something ?

sFuncSym is symbol (but not a string), and I expect RTE on:
   'rpc_' + sFuncSym
I guess it should be changed to:
   sFuncSym := __DYNSN2SYM('rpc_' + sFuncSym:name )

Message-ID: <68B865C8-32E0-4027-B61D-46EC8E09D1B9@syenar.hu>

Hi All,

Is there a safe way to clear to content of a variable in Harbour?

--- server.prg
? "Please enter password:"
ACCEPT TO pw
<process pw>
pw := NIL
<server loop>
---

I want that the content of 'pw' variable be surely 
cleared from memory.

Is this currently possible? and how?

Brgds,
Viktor

Well, I assumed so, and that's why I was asking about it, 
everything pointed towards server-side, yet I saw that the 
function to enable it was expecting a client side connection.
As it turns out I just couldn't find out how to use it.

Thanks for the information and commits.

sFuncSym is function symbol not string so you should modify this code.
I guess that IsFunction() works like __DYNSISFUN( <cFuncName> ) and
you wanted to create code like:

STATIC FUNCTION MYRPC_FILTER( sFuncSym, ... )
   LOCAL cFuncName := "rpc_" + sFuncSym:name
   IF  __DYNSISFUN( cFuncName )
      RETURN &cFuncName( ... )
   ENDIF
   RETURN "<<unsupported function>>"

One small thing. Before MYRPC_FILTER() is called NETIO_SERVER()
checks if given function exists. If not then it returns to client
NETIO_ERR_NOT_EXISTS error code. It means that if you create
function RPC_MYFUNC() and client request to execute MYFUNC()
then MYRPC_FILTER() will be executed only if MYFUNC() exists.

Viktor,

pw := Space( Len( pw ) )

could do it?

And a

pw := Stuff( pw, 1, Len( pw ), Space( Len( pw ) ) )

Given that the string has same lenght shouldn't it reuse allocated memory?

It does not expect client side connection but it expects
connection socket. In connected protocols like TCP on the
server side you have always two type of sockets.
1. listening socket which waits for connections on given
   port number
2. connection socket which is created when listening socket
   _accepts_ the connection
The data is exchanged using connection socket.
I tried to use precise names in function parameters to avoid
confusion so if sth is still not clear then please tell me
and I'll update it.
Below is a list of all PRG functions available in current NETIO
code. I'll commit it with small description soon.

Is not it appropriate to distinguish functions by server/client side as :


  NETIO_C_CONNECT( [<cServer>], [<cPort>], [<nTimeOut>], ;
                  [<cPasswd>], [<nCompressionLevel>], [<nStrategy>] )
         -> <lConnected>
   NETIO_C_DISCONNECT( [<cServer>], [<cPort>] ) -> <lOK>
   ...



   NETIO_S_LISTEN( [<nPort>], [<cIfAddr>], [<cRootDir>], [<lRPC>] )
            -> <pListenSocket> | NIL
   NETIO_S_ACCEPT( <pListenSocket>, [<nTimeOut>],
                 [<cPass>], [<nCompressionLevel>], [<nStrategy>] )
            -> <pConnectionSocket> | NIL


So that user always know what he is intended to do.
I mean s sort of distinction by function name, my opinion only.

Indirectly by functions using hb_itemGetWriteCL() on parameters passed
by reference. You can find few functions in HBRTL.

You can create dedicated function for such job:

   HB_FUNC( HB_SETSPACE )
   {
      PHB_ITEM pString = hb_param( 1, HB_IT_STRING );

      if( pString )
      {
         ULONG ulSize;
         char * buffer;

         /* clear RETURN value before calling hb_itemGetWriteCL(),
          * it's possible that it contains copy of passed item
          */
         hb_ret();

         if( hb_itemGetWriteCL( pBuffer, &buffer, &ulSize ) )
            memset( buffer, ' ', ulSize );
      }
   }

And then use it:
   hb_setSpace( @pw )
Of course it will work only if pw was not assigned to some other
location and it's the one copy of given text.

These were my two first thoughts, but internally 
I think they both just create new string and may 
leave old buffer content around in an unreleased 
block.

Maybe we will need some dedicated function to do 
this, using hb_itemGetWriteCL():

---
HB_FUNC( HB_STRCLEAR )
{
   PHB_ITEM pBuffer = hb_param( 1, HB_IT_STRING );

   if( pBuffer && HB_ISBYREF( 1 ) )
   {
      char * buffer;
      HB_SIZE nSize;

      if( hb_itemGetWriteCL( pBuffer, &buffer, &nSize ) )
         memset( buffer, '\0', nSize + 1 );
   }
}
---

Then call with:
   HB_STRCLEAR( @cPassword )

Does that look okay?

Brgds,
Viktor

Yes.

Thank you. Just posted pretty much the exact same solution :)

I'll commit a final version ASAP.

But if pw exists in a single instance, isn't it a waste to create a new item
to store a string of the same lenght?

Maybe I'm making things easier than they are... :)

BTW, if a new item is created the old should go to recycleable memory and, as
such it still is present inside memory arena of running process, but should
not be accessible anymore.

Am I wrong in both cases? :)

Maurilio.

I've seen and you even used exactly the same name as I in 1-st version :)
by then I decided that setting spaces may be more functional for users
also in some other context, i.e. clearing get variables so I changed the
name and clear byte.

Yes, speaking about STUFF(), it is, but to avoid it, 
you'd have to make several checks to verify whether 
there is room to optimize it on low level, so it's 
possible we wouldn't gain much at the end.

In case of SPACE( LEN() ), it's two calls, and there 
is no clean for the HVM to optimize it like that.

If you save the memory area of a process using system 
tools, you can still access it. It can also get swapped 
out to page file.

Of course it's difficult to clean such value from memory, 
since in most cases it's present in multiple copies, but 
I'd like to try minimizing the chance of it with some 
tricks, we will see how it goes. Current one is just a 
step in HBNETIOSRV to solve that, since accepting a pw 
from the command line isn't safe in the first place.

Brgds,
Viktor

      Notice that this method by itself can only work if the

Yes, you are right.
Thank you very much. I'll commit fix in a while.

It is posible to use HBNETIO server to share some DBF 's and
at the same time use locally a system that access the
same  DBF' s directly in shared mode ?

Since the server is just another Harbour app, I don't see 
any reason why this wouldn't be possible.

  Subject: [Harbour] MemoEdit() and Lastkey(), Escape


  Dear All,

   

  Another issue that bother me that used to work in Clipper but opposite behavior in Harbour.

   

  MemoEdit(usertxt,9,1,16,78,.T.,NIL,120)

   

  When I open memo edit widow and close immediately by ESC without any update, I have K_ESC in LASTKEY(). It is fine.

   

  However, if I do any change in a memo text and next also leave the screen by ESC, the LASTKEY() function returns me K_CTRL_W (why?); consequently I am not able to distinguish when user wants to discard or save his changes.

   

  Kindly advice.

   

  Best regards

  Robert 


Litle sample to demonstrate differences between
Clipper 5.2e and Harbour 2.0.0
----------------------------
PROCEDURE MAIN
 MEMVAR  txt
 PRIVATE txt
 
  txt  := 'Test'

  CLEAR SCREEN
  @8,0 TO 17,79
  MemoEdit(txt,9,1,16,78,.T.,NIL) 

  @20,0 SAY STR(Lastkey())
  Inkey(0)
RETURN
---------------------

Scenario
1) Exit  from Memo by ESC without any change in txt
 LASTKEY() returns 27 (ESC). Correct
2) Any edition in memo text and next exit  by ESC
 LASTKEY() returns 23 (CTRL_W). Incorrect because CTRL_W when save. It sould have been 27 (ESC) too.

Been there, done that.
On that scenario DON'T run netio server from same machine.
Wine-Samba on same machine does ugly things when locking dbfs.
A linux NetIO server uses a diferentent locking scheme.
You need to compile netio server in windows to share dbfs with windows apps.
Is not a defect from NetIO but a consecuence of mixing cliente-server 
with local acces and on top of that windows with linux.

Yes, sure though it should be PHB_ITEM so also declaration should
be fixed. Too much stupid typos in simple modifications.

It cannot be done inside STUFF() due to strictly defined Clipper
compatible syntax.
To optimize code which make
   <cVar> := STUFF( <cVar>, <nPos>, <nDel>, <cIns> )
it's necessary to detect that result of STUFF() function
is assigned to the same variable as its 1-st parameter and
replace above code by new funtcion which will operate
on parameter passed by reference, i.e.:
   __STUFF( @<cVar>, <nPos>, <nDel>, <cIns> )
So it needs new function and compile time optimization.

Samba configuration is not related to HBNETIO.
HBNETIO does not change locking scheme or anything like that.
It redirects everything to OS. The main idea of using HBNETIO
is eliminating problems with file sharing using servers like
SAMBA. Just simply access file only using HBNETIO (it doesn't
matter what is the client OS) or native applications executed
locally and you will not have any problems with incompatible
locking systems.
Anyhow if you plan to also access simultaneously files using
SAMBA as file server then you have to configure SAMBA to redirect
all locks to OS and fully respect all OS locking. You will also
have to disable any opportunistic locks in SAMBA. The redirection
of SMB locks to OS lock in SAMBA was changing in the last years
and many problems has been resolved. Some of them using new
kernel extensions so it's also very important the system used
on file server running SAMBA. I cannot answer if current state
is fully functional and safe to use in concurrent file access
by SMB protocol and as native files without checking current
SAMBA code. I'll try to check it in some spare time. Anyhow
it always needs precise configuration so the easiest solution
for concurrent file access by remote stations is using HBNETIO
and ignoring any file servers like SAMBA or MARS.

I think that it is an ideal scenario , but I need to try,

once Netio works ok , I can not use anymore Samba

The Idea it is not use windows or wine if it is posible , but

while the solution is comming the both systems must be work together

When I have some time I try to test it

Thank' s to all of you

Bruno

Thank you very much for the code example.
It has been partially fixed by Viktor:
   2010-01-13 15:10 UTC+0100 Viktor Szakats (harbour.01 syenar.hu)

Viktor this example shows that Clipper does not overwrite LastKey()
when it executes
   Abort Edit? (Y/N)
and shows 27 instead of ASC( "Y" )
Can you check it?

Robert can you try current SVN code?

Thank you very much.
I've replicated the problem and I'll commit fix in a while.
Anyhow I do not use ACHOICE() so it should be verified by someone
who really knows this function.
I left in achoice.prg one TOVERIFY note in place where I had to
disable some explicitly added code which causes that new items
added by F5 in your example were not shown immediately. I have no
idea why this code was added and when it was necessary.

best regards,

Yes, it's WINE problem, not Harbour one.

I was assuming a native executable in my answer (default case).

Running any server under WINE looks like a quite risky solution.

Thanks a bunch, I realized in the meantime there was a 
commit in between which I didn't know of when asking 
about it. It looks good.

No , the idea is to test a Linux HBNetio Server

and a Linux Native aplication , sharing Databases with

a windows aplicattion running Under Wine and Samba

IMO only WINE and SAMBA can be the problem here, not 
native .dbf and hbnetiosrv parallel access by itself.

Same problem set if you try to mix native Linux and 
non-native SAMBA/WINE apps together to access the 
same .dbf files. IOW, your question is unrelated to 
hbnetiosrv.

Viktor

      Current PP code works correctly so we can remove it and activate this

Message-ID: <5A207369-1B69-4A6E-9CF3-E2678CDDB23F@syenar.hu>

Hi All,

Any objection to start migrating all ULONG types which is 
used as string/array length, position to convert to HB_SIZE 
in all Harbour source code?

At the same time I'd like to also convert all BOOL/TRUE/FALSE 
to HB_BOOL/HB_TRUE/HB_FALSE. This is fully mechanical process.

Brgds,
Viktor

I support everything which helps creating better quality code, 
so I agree to keep it enabled.

I just read it more carefully and understood it's not 
enabled yet, so my vote is to enable it now. The fix is 
easy, similar to -w3 warnings, it just has to be done, 
and such fix doesn't have any drawbacks.

What C type you plan to use for HB_SIZE?
Using signed type resolves many problems we have now like using
negative indexes in some RTL functions but it will be necessary
to update probably a lot of code to resolve signed<->unsigned
conversion problems. BTW in practice we do not fully support
unsigned indexes in the whole range now so switching to signed
values is not reduction but rather cleaning code to eliminate
unexpected bad side effect which can appear for very big indexes.

In last year many size castings have been added to pacify
size conversion warnings. Now such castings will pacify also
important warnings in code which should be updated if we
decide to extend HB_SIZE i.e. to LONGLONG in Win64 builds
so it may not be easy job to locate all such places.

Finally we should clearly define the HB_SIZE range to not confuse
users writing C code. Now we use ULONG so everyone knows what this
type and how to make conversions between ULONG and native OS types.
When we introduce HB_SIZE then programmers will need precise
information about this type and what native OS type can be used
to hold such values.

> At the same time I'd like to also convert all BOOL/TRUE/FALSE

Yes, though maybe we should define rules for conversion between
HB_BOOL and BOOL. So far MS-Win users used the same type as in
Harbour sometimes even directly. Now they will have to know if
it's legal to make:
   hbBoolValue1 = BoolValue1;
   BoolValue2 = hbBoolValue2;
or it's necessary to make:
   hbBoolValue = BoolValue != 0;
or:
   hbBoolValue = BoolValue ? HB_TRUE : HB_FALSE;
In most of cases BOOL is defined as 'int' though on some platforms
it may be sth different, i.e. BYTE or SHORT.
Here we can resolve the problem declaring that HB_BOOL will be
always 'int' in all platforms and it does not depend on any native
BOOL type but it's necessary to check how exactly it was defined on
all platforms using HB_DONT_DEFINE_BASIC_TYPES to know what will
change and correctly define translation rules between HB_BOOL and
BOOL.

I didn't plan to make any changes in this round 
of modification, so it'd stay as ULONG.

Yes, I know. Next step will be tougher, when 
we switch HB_SIZE to signed size and we fix all 
these problems.

Nevertheless it should be done, most probably in 
several iterations, until all such places are found.

If we can locate the typical cases, I think it can 
be done. Similar to 'const char *' conversion.

Yes, this is again a task to make at the time when we 
will redefine the type. In first pass, everyone should 
keep handling it as before. Of course the final goal is 
to change the type, so what you say should be done.

Here one basic question is whether we want to offer a 
consistent range regardless of platform/architecture, 
or we tie it a C type, like int or size_t.

Since we're first and foremost a Clipper compatible 
high level compiler, probably the former should be done, 
but in this case we also limit Harbour programs when 
backend changes to 128 bit in the future (or to 64-bit 
already).

We may also guarantee a minimum range, 32-bit signed, 
and say that 64-bit and 128-bit systems automatically 
allow more. But this may raise some interoperability 
problems, question is how grave these are.

With the advent of 64-bit systems, it may be a reasonable 
feature for Harbour apps to hold even several GBs of 
data in one string, so it's not an easy decision.

For sure. I used to do this when I find such code, 
but it's not complete and need more code review.
But the end result will be cleaner.

Also C++ bool and HB_BOOL conversions need to be 
handled. There is even pending OS/2 problem in HBQT 
related to this.

Yes, well said.

On Windows it's declared 'long'.

Viktor

Hi Przemek,

First actual question is what to do with ULONG in 
hb_fsSeek(). Should it be changed to HB_SIZE or not?

[ On the longer run it will need to be changed to 
non-Windows type anyway, so we can decide about it 
even now. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

I would activate it, developers that don't have the time to fix the
code can use 2.0.

Yes, but -w3 is an option for users so they do not have to use it.
Now I'm think about adding to PP support for using some compile
time switches in #if expression to enable strict method declaration
only when -w3 or higher warning level is used.
In such way we will not force updating all 3-rd party code.

No. It cannot be HB_SIZE. It will be bug. The same is for other
functions like hb_fsWriteLarge(). All such functions have to use
parameters which are accepted by low level OS functions without
any size lost conversions.

Okay, but what non-windows type to use then? int, long, else?

As long as you do not update code which may use it then you should
use the same type 'unsigned long'.
In fact it will be good to eliminate hb_fs*Large() functions
and use only one set of functions using HB_FOFFSET as file pointer
and HB_SIZE as the block size but for this we should rewrite these
functions.

Hi Przemek,

The other area which will need to be cleaned is 
mem allocation functions (as discussed before). 
Currently it uses ULONG, but should be size_t probably.
(GC and hb_x*()).

Plus a few other value types to migrate form ULONG to 
something else:

32-bit crc values -> HB_U32
pcount -> int ?
class related ULONG value -> ?
file attribute -> HB_U32 ? or rather HB_FATTR
arg count -> int ?
alloc size -> size_t ?
file I/O -> HB_FOFFSET / HB_SIZE
clock/time related -> HB_U32 ?
parinfa retval -> HB_SIZE ?

Brgds,
Viktor

Buenos dias

Tengo otras sugerencias mas:
1- Pinter de otro color la linea actual.
2- En la statusbar mostrar la cantidad de caracteres seleccionados.

Gracias

Hi,

>   + src/rtl/strclear.c
>     + Added HB_STRCLEAR() function to safely clear the content

I suggest to change HB_STRCLEAR() code. Current implementation returns 
true, if hb_itemGetWriteCL() returns true, but it happens if pItem is 
string. It is already validated by hb_param( 1, HB_IT_STRING ), so, 
return value is not useful. If the purpose of the function is to clear 
memory containing sensitive information, the function should return if 
the memory was really cleared. I propose this code (self test included):

PROC main()
   LOCAL cI, cJ

   cI := "abc"
   ? HB_STRCLEAR(cI)

   cI := "abc"
   ? HB_STRCLEAR(@cI)

   cI := REPLICATE("a", 5)
   cJ := cI
   ? HB_STRCLEAR(@cI)

   cI := REPLICATE("a", 5)
   cJ := cI
   cJ := NIL
   ? HB_STRCLEAR(@cI)
RETURN

#pragma begindump
#include "hbapi.h"
#include "hbapiitm.h"

HB_FUNC( HB_STRCLEAR )
{
    PHB_ITEM pItem = hb_param( 1, HB_IT_STRING );

    /* NOTE: clear RETURN value before calling hb_itemGetWriteCL(),
             it's possible that it contains copy of passed item [druzus] */
    hb_retl( HB_FALSE );

    if( pItem && HB_ISBYREF( 1 ) )
    {
       const char * szPtr;
       char * pBuffer;
       HB_SIZE nSize;

       szPtr = hb_itemGetCPtr( pItem );
       hb_itemGetWriteCL( pItem, &pBuffer, &nSize );
       memset( pBuffer, '\0', nSize + 1 );
       hb_retl( szPtr == pBuffer );
    }
}
#pragma enddump


In this case HB_STRCLEAR() returns, if memory was cleared. It prints:
.F.     // Pass by reference is forgotten
.F.     // String data is static (part of PCODE) and can not be cleared
.F.     // Multiple strings exists
.T.     // OK!

Mindaugas

I change.
HB_SETCODEPAGE([PTISO]) -> hb_CdpSelect([PTISO])
No error

  * src/rtl/cdpapi.c
    * HB_SETCODEPAGE() guarded as HB_LEGACY_LEVEL2 which means
      it will be removed in next major version.
      NOTE to users: Use HB_CDPSELECT() or SET( _SET_CODEPAGE ) instead.

This I will implement today. 
Did you use it effectively ? I mean what "Codec" do you select 
from the menu and what results you get. It this is what you are doing,
can you show us a screen-shot and codec you set?

I have not been able to intercept Tab key so far.
But I am trying hard. Anybody with some solution or direction ?

I think that coloring the actual line is usefull to facilitate reading code

Only one small observation as a comment.

Not is the same UNICODE NULL L'\0' that '\0', may be irrelevant because both are zero.
Not is the same while( *pStr ) that  while( *pStr != '\0' ).

IMHO maybe we need to define HB_TEXT and HB_T as TCHAR's _TEXT, _T macros. It's common practice in windows use _TEXT for user 
messages and _T for internals like _T('\0'), I may be wrong and we just need to one macro but not only for WinCE.

Best regards,
Xavi

I plan to change all my classes to this "standard": no parameters in
method definition.

Are there any drawbacks?

That's true, but I couldn't find a rule here.
We're using plain '\0' in several places where 
we assign chars in UNICODE mode simply as 'x'.

So, in comparisons, should we always use _T(), 
while in assigments, this is not required?

or HB_SIZE if we plan to use it widely as memory block size
holder. Probably we should also create ANSI C compatible
wrappers for malloc()/calloc()/realloc()/free() (BTW we should
also add hb_xgrabz()) which can be used as redirectors in 3-rd
party code.
It will be also necessary to update all public API functions
which operates on string/array item size or their indexes.
But here we will have problem. In few critical places in core
code we already had to use 'long' instead of 'unsigned long'
when we need negative indexes. If will be bard to touch this
code if HB_SIZE is unsigned and we do not have corresponding
signed type.

This is less important, Please only remember that general CRC
functions are using max integers (usually 64bit) and accept such
polynomials.

it's already int.

There is no single replacement for ULONG used in classy code
so it has to be updated manually.

HB_FATTR is OK for me, thank you though please do not forget that
on 64bit platform only in ms-win long is 32bit integer and on all
others it's 64bit so if it's not necessary to use wider type then
internally we can use something mapped to fixed bit sise type.

It's not trivial modification it will touch few important internal
structures changing their size and alignment so it will increase
memory usage and may cause some small speed reduction. Now use
[U]SHORT as holders for number of parameters.

> alloc size -> size_t ?

size_t can be hard to write portable code. Just simply on some
platforms it's signed and on some other unsigned what creates
serious casting problem in portable code. Before we decide to
use it I would like to create table with all supported platforms
/C compilers when we can set it's signed or unsigend type.
BTW such table can be very helpful in the future and can be
extended by other things we wanted to verify, i.e. OS BOOL type
mapping.

Yes,

It will depend on context and precision. HB_U32 is definitely
too small to keep the UTC size in milliseconds like in
hb_dateMilliSeconds().

> parinfa retval -> HB_SIZE ?

It's also used for array size to it has to be HB_SIZE just like
all other functions operating on array/string sizes or indexes.

and also some types which causes limitations like:
USHORT as number of dynamic symbols. But touching it
will force updating other code, i.e. method hashing algorithm
will have to be replaced be new one. Now it's very fast bust
it needs limited range of symbol numbers, switching to 'int'
will force changing it so this should be done before we touch
it. And this modification also increases memory usage and reduce
a little bit performance.

Yes, I noticed them. We can add 'HB_ISIZ' temporarily to 
mark these occurrences, where 'HB_ISIZ' is mapped to 'long' 
and we can swap all 'long' usages to it where used as 
string/array/hash index / length.

At the point when we switch HB_SIZE to 'long', we can 
simple s&r HB_ISIZ to HB_SIZE, and delete it.

It's only important, because I'd like to get rid of ULONG 
completely. It's colliding with Windows type with the 
same name.

In some places it's ULONG, USHORT, but in this case I'll 
change it to 'int' where I notice such discrepancy.

OK.

I left it to 'unsigned long', but we can now easily 
remap it to HB_U32. I'll do this in a next commit.

Since [U]SHORT should also be eliminated, maybe a 
new special type would be the best here, like HB_PNUM.
If I'm not mistaken this is the same entity as mentioned 
previously in pcount, where it's (or at least should be) 
int. Probably we should also swicth these occurrences to 
HB_PNUM (or similar).

Your opinion?

Okay. I can't contribute here, but it would indeed 
be useful. Although if size_t is problematic, we are 
not obliged to mix to Harbour core at all.

So maybe a dedicated type would help here, too, 
like HB_TIME, HB_TIMEMS.

Indeed. I'll leave this for you.

I happened to notice a few other types, but after yesterdays 
modification it's much easier to get an overview about 
USHORT, ULONG usage by doing simple grep on code.

ULONG f.e. is also used as record number and few other things 
in RDD code.

Why yoy don't use (like as Roberto Lopez) MingGW ?

      This implementation has a little glitch which I am lookking
      to be realized with subclassing. But the prototype is in place.

  * include/hbdefs.h
    + Marked BOOL, TRUE and FALSE as HB_LEGACY_LEVEL3.
      This means these types will disappear from Harbour after next 
      major release.
      Please start to migrate to the new, pure Harbour replacement 
      types for portable Harbour code:
         HB_BOOL, HB_TRUE, HB_FALSE.

      Notice that you still may (and should) use BOOL, TRUE, FALSE
      when dealing with Windows API (and some other 3rd party APIs),
      where these are valid types in their own context.

  * include/clipdefs.h
    + Added BOOL, TRUE and FALSE as Clipper compatibility type.
      TRUE equals to 1 here for better Clipper compatibility

Hello Horodyski,

I use minigui extended. Currently I use Borland BCC. What is the advantage
to using MingGW ?

Best Regards,

Rossine.

I have not found a clear answer
Everyone have his own impression :-)

What is file size limit in DBF format ?
and in DBF-(x)Harbour ?
and in DBF-ADS 6.2x ?

I know is related to FS limit too ( FAT32: 4Gb, NTFS:... )

Viktor or another developer can accurately describe the differences.
Differences in compilers are quite significant.
You can read "5. SUPPORTED PLATFORMS AND C COMPILERS" in file INSTALL.
For WIN it is :
   win
   ---
   mingw    - MinGW GNU C 3.4.2 and above
   mingw64  - MinGW GNU C x86-64
   msvc     - Microsoft Visual C++
   msvc64   - Microsoft Visual C++ x86-64
   msvcia64 - Microsoft Visual C++ IA-64 (Itanium)

   Also supported, some features may be missing:

   watcom   - Open Watcom C/C++
   bcc      - Borland/CodeGear/Embarcadero C++ 4.x and above
   icc      - Intel(R) C/C++
   iccia64  - Intel(R) C/C++ IA-64 (Itanium)
   pocc     - Pelles C 4.5 and 5.0
   pocc64   - Pelles C x86-64 5.0
   xcc      - Pelles C for xhb
   cygwin   - Cygwin GNU C

Almost everyone went to the MinGW, and these compilers are fewer chances
for errors.
Roberto Lopez also uses MinGW.

Hi Viktor,

> while in assigments, this is not required?

I think that also but for not enter in technical reasons about different compilers / machines.
If you read a written code for ANSI / UNICODE you expect to see TCHAR's macros in literal constants if not, you should have an 
alarm justified or not.

Xavi

In short, MinGW GCC:

- generates much faster binaries, in fact one of the 
  fastest ones.
- all serious projects support MinGW, while BCC is rarely 
  supported at all (see QT, OPENSSL).

Some more:

- it's still being actively developed
- is one of the most widely used compiler
- it's GCC family, so if portability is a concern this is a plus
- BCC is a much more forgiving compiler and this may seem useful 
  when writing draft C code, but a disadvantage when the goal is 
  to create robust code.
- all versions are free
- it's open source
- much better support for recent C/C++ standards
- doesn't have a buggy memory manager
- handles .dlls better
- has win64 port, and can also build win64 binaries
- can also build wince/arm binaries.
- has no such showstopper bugs as Borland IMPLIB one.

Downsides of MinGW:

- Slower compile time.
- Somewhat larger executables.
  (use '-strip' and '-compr' for best results)

[ In short BCC55 is 10 years old technology with stalled 
support and the worst runtime performance. It's only good 
for doing quick test builds. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

- Show the number of characters selected reduces the time when I want
to organize several gets in a terminal with 80 columns, instead of
adding the length of the field + length of the label to know where to
position the next get.

I selected IBM850 encoding. But I have to close and reopen the files
to take effect the encoding.
When you close and then restart HBIDE lost previously selected encoding.
It would be interesting to select the encoding and from there be the
default encoding.

Unfortunately my knowledge serves to help you.

Okay, I'll mark them with TEXT(), is this alright?

[ _T() is problematic as it needs yet another Windows 
header. But, TEXT() seems to work just as well for chars. ]

Okay but they are very simple macros .-

#ifdef UNICODE
#   define _TEXT(s) L##s
#else
#   define _TEXT(s) s
#endif
#define _T(x) _TEXT(x)

or .-

#define HB_TEXT(x) TEXT(x)
#define HB_T(x)    TEXT(x)

Is DLLCALL fixed? for me it still GPFs with Mingw. I'd love to use Mingw,

Nobody seems to be interested, or waits for others to fix it.
Someone will have to actually look into it.

It's not a MINGW bug though, but a Harbour one.

[ There is another bug in MINGW64 though which makes Harbour 
apps to crash in -shared mode. It may also be a Harbour 
problem, again someone should investigate. Seeing the huge 
crowd interested in my win64 .dll support effort ;), this won't 
be me. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

I can see now. Please test after r13588 and report back if all your 
requests are fully covered. Let me know any differences.

As this feature is already implemented in r13588 onwards, I am actually
interested in viewing the final output _with_ and _without_ codec, can 
you show it ? 

Actually I do not know how codecs are working. I am a user of plain english,
so do now know what could this feature makes a difference.

Thank you.

I thought you are talking about tab-key re-orientation in the editor itself.
While saving a file, I have many more tasks on my TODO list including the 
one you asked.

Thank you to remind me.

I haven't said nobody uses is, but seemingly nobody who'd 
need it is willing to put any effort into it.

>> Why would you (or Przemek or any of you good quys) not look into? (just

I'm not interested in it. I'm not getting paid for this, 
and I rarely see even a 'thank you', so I'm working on what 
I'm interested in. Current .dll implementation is an ugly 
one (with ASM), and nobody even commented on my win64 stuff, 
so I assume we don't have any experts interested in this 
enough to contribute.

The technical alternative is to write a Harbour C wrapper 
for the functions you need from other .dlls.

Brgds,
Viktor

I need more input. Codec is set right at the start of hbIDE,
then why not opened files respect it... I will look into the code.

Can you send the direct link of executable to view .ogv files ?

How many rows are visible in your editing tabs? 
I format the line number for current 100 lines.

not with MingW, i guess.

Ohh, I must object this one. there are _LOT_ of 'thank you's for you and
others in these posts, not as many as you deserve, but I guess you wouldn't
want a 'Thank You' message from every one ever day they use/enjoy Harbour. 

anyway, Thanks a zillion.

For sure MINGW is used by MINIGUI, which (AFAIK) 
offers .dll call support, so probably everything 
is out there to make it work somehow.

Thanks, my comment was not particularly pointed to 
you, it was just a general feel.

Any idea why it doesn't work?

It may be something obvious, but I can't seem to grasp it.

  * harbour/contrib/hbwin/win_tprn.prg
    ! removed left by mistake unused variable
    * save only numeric parameters in SetColor() method.
      QUESTION: TextOut() method uses 4-th parameter to control text
                alignment but it uses own constant values:
                  0 == left, 1 == right, 2 == centered
                instead of TA_* constants. Should we keep it or rather
                use windows constant values adding also support for vertical
                alignment? In current xHarbour code this parameter was changed
                to accept windows constants and 5-th parameter was added which
                is OR-ed with the 4-th one but for me this part is redundant.

I vote for Windows constants (already in hbwin.ch) and 
only one parameter. Easy to add/or them, no need for two.

None of .avi players on my system are displaying the contents.
But all of them runs the bar and tell that these videos are

It should be fixed now. Sorry I haven't noticed that you are asking
about it.

BTW current netiosrv code uses stdout output but it also try to read
input. It creates serious problems for most Harbour GT drivers.
If you want to read input then you should switch to console output
(QOut()/QQOut() instead of OutStd()).

I find it really useful because many codes may not work depending the type of compilation not only for Harbour extensions.
For example the typical problems with shortcut disabled .-

...
   IF oGet != NIL .AND. oGet:TYPE == "N"
...

Now we know how compile the code from code inside.

Thanks. Now I can play .ogv.

BTW I did not hear from you since long.
Any comments about hbQT, hbXBP, hbIDE ?

Hi Pritpal,

 

Could you please definitively switch in your development environment the
release method  to HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DELETE:

 

   //HBQT_SET_RELEASE_METHOD( HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DESTRUTOR )             //
Exits cleanly
   HBQT_SET_RELEASE_METHOD( HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DELETE )                  //
Exits cleanly
   //HBQT_SET_RELEASE_METHOD( HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DELETE_LATER )          //
Exits cleanly



In QUiLoader.cpp I changed temporarily the QT_QUILOADER_LOAD to: 

 

/*
 * QWidget * load ( QIODevice * device, QWidget * parentWidget = 0 )
 */
HB_FUNC( QT_QUILOADER_LOAD )
{
//   hb_retptr( ( QWidget* ) hbqt_par_QUiLoader( 1 )->load(
hbqt_par_QIODevice( 2 ), hbqt_par_QWidget( 3 ) ) );
   hb_retptrGC( hbqt_gcAllocate_QWidget( ( QWidget* ) hbqt_par_QUiLoader( 1
)->load( hbqt_par_QIODevice( 2 ), hbqt_par_QWidget( 3 ) ) ) );
}

reducing the FM statistic to:

Maybe we should have here a general solution for the wrappers returning
objects, some of them are already solved with inserting their pointers to
the GC system evidence.

In hbIDE or in hbQT as a whole ?
In hbIDE I have changed it as default.

Are you done with your experiments with HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_* and 
have come to conclusion that HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DELETE is the best ?
OR
We need more time to decide?

A good idea but I am at a loss how we can achieve it dynamically
and in the generator. The above change you asked is manually added in 
QUiLoader.qth.

But:
Very complicate
cVar := savecolor('+w/b')

Set color to cVar
more simple is:
@ 11,21 prompt "Action 1"   color '+w/b'
For exemple, GetdefaultPrinter() and other features is not clipper 
functions.

Otherwise I am user Hwgui, is for my old program...

Message-ID: <02f201ca962c$bbc185f0$334491d0$@com>

Hi,

Congratulations on a great release with Harbour 2.0!

If this is the wrong place to ask, let me know, and I'll post elsewhere, but
I'm having the continuation of a long term problem with large data file
(>2gb) read errors.  Mostly I get 1010's from standard errorblock trapping,
but sometimes get

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Application Internal Error -app.exe
Terminated at: 2010.01.15 12:39:02
Unrecoverable error 9201: hb_cdxPageSeekKey: wrong parent key.
Called from DBSEEK(0)

In hb_out.log - no trapping by errorsys, the app just dies.  I've tried many
many iterations of lock types, dirty read's on/off etc.  The file in
question is normally getting extended via a Flock()/Append From/UNLOCK code
segment (the write process never crashes), and the read process (the one
that crashes with 1010's and the above occasional hb_out.log's) usually dies
on DBSeek, DBSkip, or a good old fashioned field read (x := FIELD->x).
Additionally, the indexes are never actually corrupted, but the reading
application exe sure thinks so...

FWIW, these errors only start to occur when the data file size breaches 2gb
or so.

My rddsys is as follows.


  REQUEST _DBF
  REQUEST DBFFPT
  REQUEST DBFCDX
  rddSetDefault( "DBFCDX" ) 

and my (current - I've tried _many_ iterations) RddInfo settings are:

  // default lock scheme...
  RddInfo( RDDI_LOCKSCHEME, DB_DBFLOCK_VFP )
  
  // enable index dirty reads...
  //RddInfo( RDDI_DIRTYREAD, True )
  
Server environments include Win 2000/2003/2008 server, all applications that
share these files run locally, no network sharing of any kind.

I've been wrestling with this for months now, and would appreciate some
steering?

TIA,

FS

I think I found a way to do so.

Which is right, because it's not a Clipper compatible command.

If you want to use it with Harbour, add #include "hbcompat.ch" 
to your app, to enable this xhb compatibility feature.

The hbIDE downloaded from SVN the HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DESTRUTOR is selected. 

Generally we should use HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DELETE.

The HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DESTRUTOR method does not release the memory allocated by the operator new.
The HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DELETE_LATER method releases the allocated memory with a delay.

Thank you.

The resources of the objects returned by the wrappers as return value are not released automatically by the GC system.
We need here a general solution.

It is due to the latest Harbour standard where method definitions
have to be exactly the same as  method ddeclarations.

I have already fixed and will be committing shortly.

So it should be out of our experiments then. I will remove from generator.

For sure we need a general solution.
But the solution above is destructive,  I cannot even compile qtcore
after changes above to honour 

   hb_retptrGC( hbqt_gcAllocate_Q*( new Q*( hbqt_par_Q*( 1 )->somefunction(
hbqt_par_someparam( 2 ), someparamnext( 3 ) ) ) ) );

The reason is we never want a "new" object for return values it it is 
of type FAR. hbQT will not work at all as we will be dealing with local 
copy of the object in question. If the type is not FAR we can employ
this technique. This is what is employed currently.

The solution could be like ( and I did it initially ):

Construct a GC pointer which holds this pointer and releases the wrapper
returned pointer.

BTW I am not a C guru so I may be wrong.

What kind of a roadmap you are expecting ?
Things are coming as is being learned, and also 
there is a least support from any other corners.
And a human-being always have limitations.

Why do not you try to contribute something, 
say MDICHILD ?

Wow, now it works, great to see it, Thank you.
Opens lots of possibilities.

I know, it's a work in progress. I'll switch the interactive 
part to QOUT(), I'll need GET any for a better input method.

Probably RPC trace output will be best to direct into separate 
console or separate section of the console, or file.

BTW, why can I launch multiple server instances on same 
iface/port? (on Win7) Should the second one exit with 
error?

Another issue with HB_STRCLEAR().
Client won't be able to connect, if I start the server like this:
---
   netiosrv[ _NETIOSRV_pListenSocket ] := ;
      netio_mtserver( netiosrv[ _NETIOSRV_nPort ],;
                      netiosrv[ _NETIOSRV_cIFAddr ],;
                      netiosrv[ _NETIOSRV_cRootDir ],;
                      iif( Empty( netiosrv[ _NETIOSRV_cRPCFHRB ] ), netiosrv[ _NETIOSRV_lRPC ], hb_hrbGetFunSym( netiosrv[ _NETIOSRV_cRPCFHRB ], _RPC_FILTER ) ),;
                      @cPassword )

   netiosrv[ _NETIOSRV_lEncryption ] := ! Empty( cPassword )
   hb_StrClear( @cPassword )
---

If I deleted HB_STRCLEAR() call it's OK.
I's also OK if I deleted "@" from "@cPassword" in netio_mtserver() call.

Brgds,
Viktor

I looked into QMdiArea documentation and it seems preety simple.
In what way you want  to see MDI window? Give me an example 
what you want to see as MDI application in context of hbIDE ?

sorry you don?t understand me
a roadmap, only for know where this tool go
ex: the functions that you?ll implement
mdichild is a window stuck on main window

i have got compile hbqt with vailton?s help
i saw some functions about hbqt and i am impressioned

sorry, i don?t wanted hurt you
i only quant to know when you think hbqt is ready to produce anything with hbqt

one more time, i am sorry

In what way you want  to see MDI window? Give me an example 
what you want to see as MDI application in context of hbIDE ?

Oh, so you were looking for QMdiArea() and QMdiSubWindow() classes.
Please check after r13604.

For final tool yes. Anyhow I think that we should reactivated
original trivial code in /hbnetio/tests directory. Now it begins
to be a little bit complicated code so it's not trivial example
for users who want to understand how it works and use it in their
own programs.

The second instance should fail because it should not be possible
to bind two connection sockets with thew same port. Don't ask me
what Win7 plans to do which such sockets.

It's expected. You are clearing the only one copy of cPassword variable
before it's used for incoming connections.
Instead of:
   hb_StrClear( @cPassword ) /* Attempt to clear plain text pw from memory */
You should make:
   cPassword := NIL

BTW:
         hb_StrClear( @cParam )
         hb_StrClear( @aParam[ cParam:__enumIndex() ] )
above two calls are redundant. cParam is exactly reference to
@aParam[ cParam:__enumIndex() ] so the second call operates on
the same item so only the 1-st one is significant. You can also
remove:
   aParam := hb_AParams()
and use:
   FOR EACH cParam IN { ... }

My 2cents: MDI windows seem to be a thing of the past, 
at least I can't see them anymore in any application, 
including MS ones. Either tabbed interfaces replaced it, 
or independent document windows.

As for HBIDE, current tabbed one seem to be good, so 
I'd personally vote to keep it.

Of course MDI support can be added to HBQT for those 
who need it anyway in their apps.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi,

I think, you are referring to the log generated by the following lines:

HB_TRACE( HB_TR_DEBUG, ( "hbqt_gcRelease_QUiLoader                   Object deleted! %i B %i KB", ( int ) hb_xquery( 1001 ), hbqt_getmemused() ) );

Yes, indeed the message is too optimistic, but in any case shows that the hbqt sends a request the Qt layer to do it.
The FM statistic and valgrind output should be the basis of our investigations.

>> The HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DELETE_LATER method releases the allocated memory
>> with a delay.
>>

> So it should be out of our experiments then. I will remove from generator.

In this way, we will restrict the possibilities of the hbqt based application developers.
This release method is useful in a situation when the object is no more necessary, but there are some pending events related to this object.

So, this issue should be marked as TODO.

Sorry, very busy in the last weeks.

Now, I'm the only active developer in the project xhgtk. So, I have to 
split time between the two projects to spend some time developing and 
providing support for users.

About hbxbp, I'm reading the Alaska Xbase++ documentation to learn how 
to use the classes. After this step, I'll be more prepared to contribute 
with the development and to provide some support for users.

I can't see any guarantee that the delayed method would 
_ensure_ that. IMO it should be deleted to not confuse users. 
If there is a pending event to an object, the object should 
not be deleted, and this should be ensured by QT and HBQT 
_by default_.

Currently it's not even ensured by HBQT, which is marked 
as TOFIX in code. (simple ptr reference is stored without 
reference counting).

BTW, here latest HBIDE shows no more leaks, but it still 
crashes on exit (MINGW/WIN7).

HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DELETE should be made the default on HBQT 
level, and any app-level tweaking (in HBIDE, demos) deleted.

Viktor

Could you please share with us your experiments mainly MINGW/WIN7 and
VS2008/WIN7 (or VS20xx/WIN7) with and without hbcppmm. Thank you in advance.

I agree, this is now the best direction.

MINGW 4.4.1-2 TDM on WIN7/64 crashes at the end, but no hb_out.log is 
generated, SVN is r13605. Without hbcppmm, it just exists without error.

Sorry, no MSVC QT tests at the moment, since this would 
need reconfiguration and lots of time, and I'm dealing 
with other things, and the queue is just getting longer.

I hope someone else can do it. (all components are freely 
available to everyone)

Brgds,
Viktor

Thank you.

MINGW 4.4.1-2 TDM on Vista SP2/32 shows the same behavior.
VS2008 on Vista SP2/32 with hbcppmm crashes at the end but after FM statics
generation. Without hbcppmm, it just exists without error. 

Fedora 12 native build is error free with and without hbcppmm.

Any input from other platforms is useful.

My 2cents: MDI windows seem to be a thing of the past, 
at least I can't see them anymore in any application, 
including MS ones. Either tabbed interfaces replaced it, 
or independent document windows.

As for HBIDE, current tabbed one seem to be good, so 
I'd personally vote to keep it.

Of course MDI support can be added to HBQT for those 
who need it anyway in their apps.

Brgds,
Viktor

Done.
I have yet another question about one modification implemented in xHarbour.
It supports yet:
   :AskProperties
which allow to activate DocumentProperties dialog from :Create() method
so user can make interactively his own settings. Below is xHarbour
ChangeLog entry which introduced this feature.
Question to windows users:
   Do you think it's valuable extension? Should we add it too?

xHarbour also supports TextOutW() and TextOutWAt() methods but I do not
want to implement them because they use HVM string items directly casted
to windows wide char strings. For me it's rather a workaround for missing
direct support for compilation with UNICODE macro and automatic HVM CP
translation then final solution. Additionally we will have to remove it
when we add support for UNICODE string items to HVM. Please note that
when Harbour ms-windows build is compiled with UNICODE macro then all
strings passed from user code are automatically translated to unicode
values using current HVM codepage what effectively resolves encoding
problems when user wants to print text encoded in the same CP as used
by HVM.
Anyhow if someone really needs above methods now then we can add WIN32PRN
class to XHB library which will inherit from WIN_PRN and here we can
implement them.

Hm, can't see much against it, if it works properly.

[ Update: After reading the ChangeLog entry, the Win95 
weirdness makes this feature rather strange. I'd guess 
that this omission have a proper solution, and always 
assuming that user clicked 'OK' (IOW ignoring what 
user selected) is not the right thing to do. IMO this 
needs to fixed to be true to Harbour quality. It's 
also better solution to not present the windows on 
Win9x systems at all. This way at least users are 
free of surprises. ]

No, this is an ugly hack which we have a much better solution for.
Anyway such low-level details should never be propagated to .prg 
level, otherwise we lose the major advantage of such high-level 
language as Harbour.

Direct tests gave many answers

Note: I do not have problems with 2 Gb limit in DBF files, but some 
users requested me about this problem, crossing 2 Gb they have errors 
and need to split DBF files to avoid errors and index corruption

Tests with different sections of code below have expected results:

---------------
// REQUEST _DBFCDX
REQUEST DBFCDX

#include "set.ch"
#include "dbinfo.ch"

function Main()

LOCAL nTotRec, nRec

rddsetdefault( "DBFCDX" )
//
dbcreate( "mytest", ;
  {{ "field1", "C", 20, 0 }, ;
   { "field2", "C", 200, 0 }, ;
   { "field3", "D", 8, 0 }, ;
   { "field4", "M", 10, 0 } ;
  } )
USE mytest
INDEX ON field1 TO mytest
nTotRec := INT( ( 4500000*1000 - header() ) / recsize() )
? nTotRec
nRec := 0
WHILE nRec <= nTotRec
  dbappend()
  REPLACE FIELD1 WITH STR(SECONDS())
  REPLACE FIELD4 WITH STR(SECONDS())
  DBRUNLOCK()
  nRec++
ENDDO
//

use mytest index mytest

/*
APPEND FROM mytest2
*/

? INT( ( 4500000*1000 - header() ) / recsize() )

? "lastrec()", lastrec()

? "SET( _SET_MFILEEXT )", SET( _SET_MFILEEXT )
? "SET( _SET_MBLOCKSIZE )", SET( _SET_MBLOCKSIZE )
? "SET( _SET_AUTORDER )", SET( _SET_AUTORDER )
? "SET( _SET_AUTOPEN )", SET( _SET_AUTOPEN )
? "DBINFO( DBI_MEMOBLOCKSIZE )", DBINFO( DBI_MEMOBLOCKSIZE )

dbgoto( lastrec()-10 )
? recno()

dbgoto( int(lastrec()/2) )
? recno()
// inkey(0)
// dbedit()
nRec := FIELDGET(1)
DBGOBOTTOM()
DBSEEK( nRec )
? recno(), nRec
// inkey(0)
// dbedit()
DBSKIP()
? recno()

return nil
----------------

and expected are (all with DBFCDX, BCC551, WinXPPsp2) :

a) NTFS. Bigger than 4 Gb ( 2**32 )
15/01/2010  09:16 p.m.     4,500,000,191 mytest.dbf
15/01/2010  09:16 p.m.     1,205,021,952 mytest.fpt
15/01/2010  09:16 p.m.       104,111,104 mytest.cdx

b) FAT32. Limited to 4 Gb due FS ( 4,294,967,296 )
15/01/2010  09:52 p.m.     4,294,967,109 mytest.dbf
15/01/2010  09:52 p.m.     1,150,117,760 mytest.fpt
15/01/2010  09:52 p.m.        99,118,080 mytest.cdx

Fail where must fail with a beautiful message:

   Error DBFCDX/1011  Write error: mytest.dbf (DOS Error 112)

c) HPFS. Not tested due lack of space. Must fail in 2 Gb

d) Linux (Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, JFS, ... ). Not tested due lack of space
Must fail in 2 Gb in older kernels and bigger than 4 Gb in others

e) Results with Clipper 5.3a, as expected (not create/add, just values 
and record pointer "movement")

   18828451

      SET( _SET_MBLOCKSIZE )         64
      SET( _SET_MBLOCKSIZE )         0
   It must be fixed ?

h) Tests with APPEND FROM cross 2 Gb value without problem, and record 
pointer movement work fine, including DBSEEK()
This test was for check report of Fred Seyffert (RE: DBFCDX Issues)


As we have:
1) DBF files larger than 2 Gb do not fail
2) Record pointer movement does not fail in these files, including DBSEEK()
3) APPEND FROM / record pointer movement does not fail
4) Users confirm these kind of errors happen crossing 2 Gb,
  for example Fred Seyffert:
========================
I'm having the continuation of a long term problem with large data file
(>2gb) read errors.  Mostly I get 1010's from standard errorblock trapping,
but sometimes get

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Application Internal Error -app.exe
Terminated at: 2010.01.15 12:39:02
Unrecoverable error 9201: hb_cdxPageSeekKey: wrong parent key.
Called from DBSEEK(0)
[...]
I've been wrestling with this for months now, and would appreciate some
steering?
========================

then I think these errors happen in other scenarios/environments 
different to my tests, where more complex operations and movements are 
involved, including differents flows of use

Perhaps some kind of memory corruption, limits in some functions ( 
DBSEEK(), DBGOTO(), ... ) dealing with values greater than 2**31 under 
certain circunstances ? Compiler issues ?

In the past I was answering for such questions over 10 times.
You may find these messages in the Harbour and xHarbour mailing
list archives. A short description I added also to tests/xhb-diff.txt

I do not know ADS details so I do not it's limitations.
For sure it does not support all Harbour extenssions so they are
smaller and for sure there is nothing in ADS what exceed Harbour
any limits for DBFs and related files (memos and indexes) so
migration to ADS without changing the format to ADT+ADM+ADI can
only reduce the maximum supported file size or in some cases leave
them on the same level. If someone claims sth different then he
simply does not know what he's talking about and you can ignore him.
If you need bigger files then you have to switch to different format.
Each program which uses OS files is limited by OS API. The exact
limitations can be found in the OS documentation and they depends
on the operating system internals (OS kernel) and used file system (FS).
Additionally please remember that locking schemes can seriously reduce
maximum file size. On some systems it's not possible to read from locked
area. In such case you have to switch all your applications accessing
the files to locking scheme which do not cause such limitations, i.e.
use Harbour 64bit locking.

Right conclusion.

They use non POSIX system i.e. DOS or WINDOWS with VFP locking scheme
in which the RLOCK and FLOCK are is at range 0x6E6B27FF : 0x7FFFFFFE.
In such systems read/write access from locked region is blocked by
OS if client is not lock owner so the above error appear when other
station [R|F]locked some records in DBF file and user program wants
to read records which are located in the above range. That's all.
It's expected behavior. They should read about locking schemes and
switch to other locking scheme which do not cause such limitation.

And this is result of file corruption, i.e. due to wrong CPs or server/
client computer crash and FS corruption.

I've never heard about such limits in code I created. All limits
are result of used file structures and external limitations like
used OS or FS. Harbour does not introduce any own limits. Anyhow
if you will find sth then I'm very interesting. For sure it will
be fixed immediately.

Subject: [Harbour] bug and patch for harupdf.ch, please review and apply
Message-ID: <6943770e1001161538i11e740cdr806595fafabc30c5@mail.gmail.com>

In harupdf.ch the following line (701)
   hb_retnl( ( long ) HPDF_Page_TextWidth( ( HPDF_Page ) hb_parptr( 1
), hb_parc( 2 ) ) );

should be changed in
   hb_retnd( ( double ) HPDF_Page_TextWidth( ( HPDF_Page ) hb_parptr(
1 ), hb_parc( 2 ) ) );


since function definition in Haru library is:

HPDF_EXPORT(HPDF_REAL)
HPDF_Page_TextWidth  (HPDF_Page    page,
                      const char  *text);



It now returns a integer value instead of a decimal one... and it kept
breaking my column alignment....


Thanks
Francesco

    ! This commit change some rules to parse .qth files to 
      prepare the wrappers to be encapsulated in hb_retptrGC 
      envelop. It also attempts to pin-point the spots where
      mem-leak could occur. Only very few calls are left to 
      plain hb_retptr() which eventually will be handled
      the other way.

      Only delete ( Q* ) p; is retained. Other two methods are
      eliminated. Demos are updated to respect it.

      demoQT and demoXBP now consume very less memory when new 
      dialogs are opened. It means memory management has 
      improved with this commit. Anyhow still I can see 
      memory growing specially in browser navigation. As I 
      remember sometime in past I could manage the sonstant memory,
      but now I do not remember at what stage we were on Qt.

      Though all the three variants, demoQT, demoXBP, hbIDE are 
      working properly, still there could be regression, please test.

This is becoming more interesting  :-)

First thanks for your help

 >In the past I was answering for such questions over 10 times.
 >You may find these messages in the Harbour and xHarbour mailing

I read xhb-diff.txt and checked it
About "over 10 times":
I have seen before your info about "locking schemes" and so on, but in 
that cases was not relevant because does not exist a direct need and we 
usually do not go deep in those messages if we are not involved
For example, nobody have response for my recent messages about hbcurl, 
hbcairo, hbqt because are considered as irrelevant in this moment

Surprisely, except for source code, there are not reference of 
DB_DBFLOCK_VFP, "locking scheme" in doc files and even changelog file

My mail file for Harbour messages reached 105 Mb file size and no one 
editor in OS/2 can open it ( EPM, E, TEDIT, JEdit )  :-)
So I used many hours to split file in many files until it can open under 
50 Mb:
harbour0   21 Mb, 2006 to 2007
harbour08  26 Mb, 2008
harbour09a 31 Mb, 2009 first six months
harbour    27 Mb, 2009 rest six months

as we can see, 2009 was plenty of messages

... and surprisely too, in messages there are not too much info about 
dbf file sizes, "locking schemes".
Last and detailed message was around 30 Oct 2009

In source code we find info as this:

/* LOCK SCHEMES */
#define DB_DBFLOCK_DEFAULT    0
#define DB_DBFLOCK_CLIP       1
#define DB_DBFLOCK_CL53       2
#define DB_DBFLOCK_VFP        3
#define DB_DBFLOCK_CL53EXT    4
#define DB_DBFLOCK_XHB64      5

/* DBF locking schemes */
#define DBF_LOCKPOS_CLIP                  1000000000UL
#define DBF_LOCKPOS_CL53                  1000000000UL
#define DBF_LOCKPOS_VFP                   0x40000000UL
#define DBF_LOCKPOS_VFPX                  0x7ffffffeUL
#define DBF_LOCKPOS_CL53EXT               4000000000UL
#define DBF_LOCKPOS_XHB64                 HB_LL( 0x7FFFFFFF00000001 )

which are difficult to understand for a user without too much knowledge
For example, what is CL53EXT, VFPX ?

For me was hard to find information about this case
Perhaps info is there somewhere but I do not found it, so I suggest you 
to expand xhb-diff.txt or create a different one to clarify:
- DBF file size limit ( currently brief )
- "locking schemes"
so users can be oriented to file info in place to repeat in messages

I have more info provided by users
They are using my (x)Harbour systems with ADS 6.2x and VFP systems with 
unknown connection type to ADS

As you know ADS have two "Locking Modes":
  - Advantage Proprietary Locking
  - Advantage Compatibility Locking with Xbase Files
and I do not know which are technical details of each one, and if 
"compatibility mode" is based in VFP type or if 2 Gb size is involved

I checked and my systems are using "Proprietary mode" and "rights 
checkings" by default but I do not know what is using VFP

Along years I did not found detailed info in ADS docs about technical 
facts of both "locking modes", so I respect to use Proprietary

I do not know what is "range 0x6E6B27FF : 0x7FFFFFFE"  :-)
It is related to 2 Gb ?

First info of users was about failure reaching 2 Gb, but maybe what is 
happening is related to "locking scheme" and not DBF file size

Until now we confirmed it is not a file size problem and next tests must 
be for "locking schemes"

So I have to check what ways they are using to connect ADS-VFP and 
exactly what kind of errors are happening, including memo corruption 
perhaps for a different memo block size used

I am sure of it too, thanks  :-)

I did notice it and thanks for these tests, but I'd suggest 
to patch (or send patches for) existing .hbc files, after you 
tested them with hbmk2 successfully using OS/2 specific 3rd 
party lib names. It's rather inefficient if I edit them without 
testing and we iterate it endlessly. Plus for me it's impossible 
to decide which one of the possible true OS/2 lib name setups 
should be put into SVN .hbc files. Ideally the default here 
should be what _most_ OS/2 users would expect.

You should add:
{os2}libs=...

Plus you should exclude existing libs= lines with 
{!os2} if they are not currently protected.

Message-ID: <4B533938.7050909@gmail.com>

Hi All,

Recently I explained to a new user, how to start working in Windows with Harbour SVN. I want to share with everyone maybe this 
it's can help to someone.

1) Donwload Qt LGPL SDK for Windows and install in D:\Qt .-

http://qt.nokia.com/downloads

We have Qt Creator and MinGW C/C++ copy in D:\Qt\2009.05\mingw
To access Qt's dll, MinGW and our future Harbour's binaries inside D:\Qt\harbour .-
Set Path=%PATH%;D:\Qt\2009.05\qt\bin;D:\Qt\2009.05\mingw\bin;D:\Qt\harbour\bin;
This change should do in "My PC" context menu option Properties, Environment Variables.
Create a new Environment Variables HB_USER_LIBPATHS with D:\Qt\2009.05\qt\lib To simplify Path parameter.

2) Download MinGW from the official page, from TMD and install in D:\Qt\MinGW .-

http://www.tdragon.net/recentgcc

Select in tree control "Or, select the optional components you wish to have installed:"
Components\gcc (TMD Unstable: 4.4.1-tmd-2-dw2)\Version\TMD Unstable: 4.4.1-tmd-2-dw2
[ Install ]
Inside directory D:\Qt\MinGW\bin .-
Copy gcc-dw2.exe to gcc.exe
Copy g++-dw2.exe to g++.exe

To change the working copy of MinGW only need change the Path to bin.
Set Path=D:\Qt\MinGW\bin;D:\Qt\harbour\bin;D:\Qt\2009.05\qt\bin;%PATH%
In "My PC", Environment Variable (recommended) .-
Path D:\Qt\MinGW\bin;D:\Qt\harbour\bin;D:\Qt\2009.05\qt\bin;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;

3) Donwload Code::Blocks (only need the IDE but if you want a copy of MinGW) and install in C:\Program files .-

http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries

Unzip attache lexer.zip and copy files lexer_prg.xml, lexer_prg.sample to C:\Program files\CodeBlocks\share\CodeBlocks\lexers
When open a *.prg into C::B associate with this lexer.
Apart all the defaults we have two interesting plugins: DragScroll and Shell Extensions .-

4) Donwload and install TortoiseSVN .-

http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads

Make new dir D:\Qt\dev\trunk\harbour, inside, context menu option SVN Checkout... .-

URL of repository: https://harbour-project.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/harbour-project/trunk/harbour
Checkout directory: D:\Qt\dev\trunk\harbour

We have the latest Harbor's sources. To refresh only need select harbour directory inside D:\Qt\dev\trunk and use context menu 
option SVN Update.
Select directory trunk inside D:\Qt\dev Copy (NOT CUT or MOVE) and Paste to D:\Qt
We have a working copy of Harbor's sources in D:\Qt\trunk\harbour To refresh only need erase directory trunk inside D:\Qt and 
repeat the operation.

Open with C::B src\compiler\hbgenerr.c inside D:\Qt\trunk\harbour find and select hb_compDispMessage function line 152 change 
with .-

static void hb_compDispMessage( HB_COMP_DECL, char cPrefix, int iValue,
                                            const char * szText, const char * szPar1, const char * szPar2 )
{
               char buffer[ 512 ];

               if( HB_COMP_PARAM->currModule )
               {
                  hb_snprintf( buffer, sizeof( buffer ), "\r%s:%i: ",
                               HB_COMP_PARAM->currModule, HB_COMP_PARAM->currLine );
                               hb_compOutErr( HB_COMP_PARAM, buffer );
               }

               hb_snprintf( buffer, sizeof( buffer ), "%s %c%04i  ",
                            cPrefix == 'W' ? "warning" : "error", cPrefix, iValue );
               hb_compOutErr( HB_COMP_PARAM, buffer );
               hb_snprintf( buffer, sizeof( buffer ), szText, szPar1, szPar2 );
               hb_compOutErr( HB_COMP_PARAM, buffer );
               hb_compOutErr( HB_COMP_PARAM, "\n" );
}

This makes happy Code::Blocks, he thinks Harbour is MinGW. Errors and warnings will be presented and positioned in the Editor.

Make new dir D:\Qt\harbour and make new file make_harbour.cmd in D:\Qt .-

Set HB_ARCHITECTURE=win
Set HB_COMPILER=mingw
Set HB_BUILD_MODE=cpp
Set HB_USER_CFLAGS=-Wextra

Set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=D:\Qt\harbour
Set HB_WITH_QT=D:\Qt\2009.05\qt\include
Set HB_CONTRIB_ADDONS=gtqtc

cd trunk\harbour
mingw32-make install >res.log 2>res.txt
cd ..
cd ..
Pause

We have file D:\Qt\make_harbour.cmd, just need to execute to create Harbour's binaries in D:\Qt\harbour
Also we have files inside D:\Qt\trunk\harbour res.log and res.txt with Errors and warnings.

We may have copies of directories D:\Qt\harbour and D:\Qt\trunk\harbour for different configurations we just have to rename them 
to their original names.

5) Starts C::B Create a new project, select Empty project.

Project title: hbide
Folder to create project in: select D:\Qt\trunk\harbour\contrib\hbide

Hi,

It'd seem a good idea to add compiler switch to 
customize error/warning message output to make 
existing IDEs happy (and such patches unnecessary).

BTW, my Code::Blocks build already had that .prg lexer 
preinstalled. (current release for Mac OS X)

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi!

I'm getting an error with the latest version of hbide. I open a file
and then hit ENTER and BACKSPACE then a GPF error appears.

Inside the file hb_out.log I see:

Called from QT_QEVENTLOOP_PROCESSEVENTS(0)
Called from QEVENTLOOP:PROCESSEVENTS(0) in ../../../TQEventLoop.prg
Called from APPEVENT(0) in ../../../xbpgeneric.prg
Called from HBIDE:CREATE(323) in hbide.prg
Called from MAIN(100) in hbide.prg
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The error remains even after running a make clean install.

Vailton Renato

Can you check after r13615 ?

I cannot reproduce is on my system.

Hi Pritpal,

After rebuilding everything I'm getting a GPF when 
right clicking on the edit area, then the right-click 
menu appears, then I click back on the edit area 
and there it GPFs.

An another error present since the feature was added:
Split the edit area horizontally, then close the split, 
the split it vertically, it will split the area into 
4 sections with two of them active.

Brgds,
Viktor

Yes, I can reproduce it. Will be fixing in a while with 
some other improvements.

The current implementation has 0 tolerance, it is good.

Not an error but implementation lazyness.
I will address this issue in a couple of days.

Thank you for the input.

Exit on crash may exist. 
This is for what the whole new exercise is done.
It is bad that no logs are generated, but I am looking into
different scenarios, hopefully will find a solution.

Subject: [Harbour] OT: using a shared folder on my WinXP box to hold source
 code for Harbour but shared by by my Ubuntu box
Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP617D68E5E3BAAD754A2B9BEF670@phx.gbl>

I've updated my Ubuntu box to 9.10 but lost all settings.  I've manually 
rebuilt them, at this point I've got my Ubuntu box to mount the WinXP 
Harbour folder.

I've got past the Ubuntu issue where it reports a "Value too large for 
defined data type" error while compiling.

However I'm running into a problem where Ubuntu wants to create a 
symbolic link for libharbour.so on the WinXP harddrive and this raises 
an "Operation not support" error.  When I re-run make this is bypassed 
but the compiled test program now cannot find libharbour.so

I'd like to maintain only one copy of the repository tree, on my WinXP 
box, so what, if any, solution is there to this? 

Would rebuilding Harbour with HB_BUILD_SHARED=no circumvent this?

Hi!

The problem here remains with the revision 13620, but I could not
compile the hbxbp using "HB_USER_PRGFLAGS =-l-" to display the line

Message-ID: <6943770e1001180057s7d808281m613fe8a32da2e06f@mail.gmail.com>

I've integrated Harupdf in my program. Haru creates a file and I
wanted to open the satndard, system defined pdf viewer.

I opted to the simplest command:

 run( ::pdfFileName )

This worked flawlessy in my XP pro development notebook, opening the
Acrobat Reader window while the Harbour program was still running.


This morning I run the program on the Win 2k VM at the users site to
do some integration testing and at the run() command I got a annoying
message talking about redirecting win32 debug message to the remote
collector.. annoying but still ok, harbour program still running...

I then run the code on my XP pro office development workstation and
Acrobat opened but Harbour program was LOCKED till I closed
Acrobat....

I then started to investigate:
run, __run, hb_run all do the same, block Harbour
win_rundetached return false but probably I didn't really understand
parameters... and probably I can't pass a pdf filename but should pass
an executable filename
wapi_shellexecute(,,::pdfFileName ) DID WORK !


Is it normal to have this different behaviour in run( ) command ?

Messages were for specific cases, not only libs list

a) hbcurl
   * Fail to build with OpenWatcom
   * undefined symbols in os2gcc
   Alternatives:
   - Fix source code
   - or, perhaps hbcurl does not work in OpenWatcom
b) hbcairo
   Missing function in one sample
   Alternatives:
   - Fix source code
   - or, perhaps sample fail in any platform
c) Contrib libs readme*
   Libs list required for each contrib based on my tests
   Alternatives:
   - Modify *.h* files by myself
   - Describe list, done in readme* file

d) hbqt
   List of source files which have errors on OS/2 and detailed flow of tests
   Alternatives:
   - Fix source code
   - Perhaps this code does not work on OS/2 - Qt

   But Pritpal is highly focused in hbide now   :-)

   Most errors are of kind:
   'A' is not a member of 'B'
   class 'C' has no member named 'D'
   'E' was not declared in this scope
   expected primary-expression before ')' token
   invalid use of incomplete type 'F'
   incomplete type 'G' used in nested name specifier
   forward declaration of 'H'
   expected type-specifier before 'I'

   I do not know if:
   - Are valid errors which must be fixed on Harbour
   - Other compiler switchs required
   - They are errors related to OS/2-Qt code and not Harbour

}

MyClass::MyClass()

Easily possible. The errors you sent are 
all reported in system headers and libcurl 
headers. We can't fix those in Harbour.

Ideally this problem should be reported to 
libcurl developers.

Unfortunately there is no way to disable 
dependency detection for platform/compiler 
combinations (os2/watcom) in Harbour, so OS/2 
users will have to make sure not to set 
HB_WITH_CURL when building for watcom.

> b) hbcairo
>  Missing function in one sample

It seems that OS/2 cairo version has no 
'CAIRO_HAS_IMAGE_SURFACE' support, and this 
makes test app break. The correct fix here is to 
provide Harbour level function regardless of 
cairo version, but return permanent error in 
this case. This is the method used in all other 
Harbour lib bindings.

I hope Mindaugas can fix it.

Lib dependencies are never documented in INSTALL, 
instead, they are configured in appropriate .hbc files.
In INSTALL, we can document _package_ dependencies 
and packages web links, but never actual lib filenames.

I can't comment on those. Only that the bool conversion 
problem could probably be easily fixed (unless it's an 
OS/2 compiler bug), for someone good in C++.

According to its own help, it does:
---
Context control:
  -B, --before-context=NUM  print NUM lines of leading context
  -A, --after-context=NUM   print NUM lines of trailing context
  -C, --context=NUM         print NUM lines of output context
  -NUM                      same as --context=NUM
      --color[=WHEN],
      --colour[=WHEN]       use markers to highlight the matching strings;
                            WHEN is `always', `never', or `auto'

According to this:
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd183576(VS.85).aspx

"If the function does not display the property sheet and is successful, the return value is IDOK."

This is not terribly helpful information, but it's possible that's 
what happens on Win95.

Here's an article which suggest that this feature should 
work on Win95 as well:
   http://support.microsoft.com/kb/118622

Maybe we should implement it in hbwin and try on Win9x.

Brgds,
Viktor

Viktor,

I've never used tprn, but given a .png file you need to read it so that you
have a DIB or BITMAP in memory.

I think that using freeimage you can achieve such a result.

I hope this can, at least, point you in the right direction.

Maurilio.

It is strange. Qt documentation does not tell about Ctrl+W

Anybody has some clue.

This is a shortcut from the File menu. Remember the idea of letting

Thank you very much for information.
Please note that ion example code in the above article the value
returned by 3-rd call to DocumentProperties() is ignored.
I can implement it but the tests will cause problem for me due to
limited access to MS-Windows machines.
Can I ask other users to make them?

  * contrib/hbwin/win_prn1.c
  * contrib/hbwin/hbwapi.h
    + Added public functions to return and retrieve HDC and HPEN
      handles. This makes it possible to use these in 3rd party
      code and other parts of hbwin lib. F.e. to create pure
      wrappers for GDI functions.
    + win_prn1.c now uses hbwapi_ret_*() functions to return
      HDC and HPEN handles.
    * Renamed static GC related functions.
    ! WIN_SETPEN() fixed to retrieve pointer from _2nd_ param.
      (it was 1st previously, pls review me)
    ! WIN_SETPEN() fixed to not allocate new GC pointer if
      an existing GC pointer was passed as 2nd parameter.
      (please review me)

  * contrib/hbwin/mapi.c

  * contrib/hbwin/win_prn2.c
  * contrib/hbwin/win_prn3.c
    - Deleted winspool.h header for LCC compiler.
      We don't support LCC compiler in Harbour.
    ! Cleaned windows.h inclusion.

  * contrib/hbfimage/fi_winfu.c
  * contrib/hbfimage/fi_wrp.c
    * Formatting.

It's an obsolete function since 1.0.1, it must be 
fixed like I did recently on SVN. Pls see those 
entries and diffs for details.

> function _letoKeyToStr
> error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _GetComputerNameA referenced in

It's copied code from Harbour SVN, and thus it's 
best to update it according to current Harbour SVN.
Or, at least to update it not to use forced ANSI 
Windows API.

Brgds,
Viktor

It's OK, thank you very much for fixing me. I should be more careful.

Thanks for the suggestion, and this may indeed work, 
although for local reasons it's not an option for me, 
since I'd need to distribute a .dll with my app.
(I never managed to build static libs of FreeImage, 
maybe even the license wouldn't permit it).

Tried to find out how to make such conversion by 
looking at FreeImage code, but it's quite a complicated 
piece.

libgd has nice png read routine, but it misses the save 
part AFAICS.

I read that some printer drivers are accepting png 
and jpeg directly, so it may work. As a next step 
I'll try that.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi francesco !
I have one more question to add to your interesting post...

What is the linux equivalent to that ?
I want to achieve exactly the same but on linux.

Thank you.
In my WINE version it returns IDOK even if I choose "CANCEL" so :create()
method also returns .T.

Message-ID: <E91EA6E9-E878-4C32-BC55-C94CF77301BF@syenar.hu>

Hi All,

Above extension works in xhb but is not supported 
in Harbour. Actually for good reason, so my intent 
is not to propose it for inclusion, but I still wonder 
what is the easiest way (least code change) to achieve 
the same result in Harbour.

[ NOTICE: This feature can only work if printer 
controls codes match those supported by the printer, 
and it's easily possible the printer doesn't support 
raw input _at all_. Plus it makes SET PRINTER TO 
incompatible. ]

---
SET PRINTER TO ( win_PrinterGetDefault() )
...
SET PRINTER TO
---

is equivalent to something like this in Harbour:

--- [untested]
LOCAL cTempName
FClose( hb_FTempCreateEx( @cTempName ) )
SET PRINTER TO ( cTempName )
...
SET PRINTER TO
win_PrintFileRaw( win_PrinterGetDefault(), cTempName )
FErase( cTempName )
---

Anyhow, this is my suggestion to xhb users wanting 
to switch to Harbour. If you know a better way, pls 
speak up.

Brgds,
Viktor

wapi won't work for sure in linux

In linux, to have a really detached process I usually do a:
at -f "/path/to/a/shell/script" now

In this way I'm sure stdout,stderr,stdin are "free"
at returns immediately and the daemon atq runs the detached job.

Another way is to use:
nohup /path/to/a/shell/script & > /dev/null 2>&1

I never run it from Harbour... but for example from php or other applications.

Hello All,

Thanks for the tips and explanations but for now I want to continue using
the borland. Today I tried to compile with the 13627 release and the errors
continue. Using the 13549 release everything works OK. 

Below I list some of the errors:

      Currently these are supported:
        -ge[0]: Clipper compatible (default)
        -ge1:   "IDE friendly". Mimics the one submitted by Lorenzo
                for Eclipse.
      The goal is to cover the most IDEs with the less options,
      so please test them to reach this optimum.

Shouldn't we just delete them?

We can retrieve them from old SVN revisions anytime.

Hi

You have to insert #include "windows.h" in every *.c file. (after #include
"hbapi.h")
I did it localy and it works.
It's a consequence of latest replacements of XXXXX types with HB_XXXX in 
Harbour trunk.
Anyhow I think that Grigory Filatov will have to change it.

Hi 


It's a consequence of ..... and  commenting out  #include "windows.h"

Hi

I use mingw and MSVC8 with minigui extended (distribution by Grigory
Filatov)
and I have no problems with any compiler.
Because minigui uses win32 appi, You have to #include <windows.h>

No, it's wrong solution. It's one of the most 
popular misconceptions about using windows API 
with Harbour.

Instead, see these:

You have to _request_ windows.h using HB_OS_WIN_USED 
(formerly HB_OS_WIN32_USED).

That's all. MINIGUI code wasn't updated during last 
year to use the new one.

Thank you.

Is there any particular reason to define stubs 
for non-WinCE winapi calls in hbwince.c, like 
Ellipse(), Arc(), FrameRect(), FloodFill(), 
FreeResource()?

Looks like these could be simply handled by 
HB_OS_WIN_CE guards, just like we do for all 
other similar case.

Viktor

Hi

Thank You.
I see in hbdefs.h:

/* Include windows.h if applicable and requested */
#if defined( HB_OS_WIN_USED ) && defined( HB_OS_WIN )

   #include <windows.h>
   #if defined( __GNUC__ )
      #define HB_DONT_DEFINE_BASIC_TYPES
   #endif

But I'am compiling daily minigui extended with mingw and MSVC8.
Problem appeared lately. So my naive solution was to include windows.h 
in *.c files.
Anyhow HbQt is responsible for it's Qt include files. 
By my logic (I don't have Your deep knowledge of Harbour), any
toolkit should be responsible for it's environment.

Thank You
I apreciate Your work very much
BRGS

You're right in that. But, Harbour uses several C types 
which collide with Windows types, and until we fix this 
situation, this hack is - unfortunately - required.
The historical reason is that these Windows types were 
also adopted by Clipper, so we started to use them in 
Harbour, too. For Clipper this wasn't such a huge 
problem, since it was MS-DOS based, but for Harbour it 
is, since it has to interface with virtually anything, 
among them: Windows.

So, the proper fix is on the way, but it's a pretty 
tough and long process. My BOOL -> HB_BOOL, ULONG -> 
HB_SIZE fix was on such step. There is still several 
dozens of thousands of similar lines to fix, plus 
we will have to deal with compatibility, plus 
some tougher problems like existing HB_ULONG type. 
Thus it will still take some time to be able to make 
that right.

To sum it up: The goal is to eliminate all Windows 
types from portable Harbour code, and make possible 
#include <windows.h> anywhere, without any interference 
with any Harbour code. This will also make it possible 
to build hbfimage on *nix platforms, and avoid any 
similar problem in the future.

Thank you.

Should be HB_TRUE and HB_FALSE, since they are 
passed to hb_retl() which is a Harbour API.

Should be true and false, since the return value here 
is 'bool', plain C++ type.

Hello Fran?ek Prijatelj,

With an earlier version 13549 compiled 100% for BCC. With the latest
releases from Harbor began to appear that these errors. If I can fix it for
me to continue to use BCC ?

What do I do / configure to generate the libraries for MiniGUI using MinGW /
MSVC

Best regards,

The C compiler is irrelevant regarding this problem.

Pls read my answers and ChangeLog entries.

Hi Pritpal,

- Right-click GPF is gone. Thank you.
  This was again the case where a GPF had to be corrected on 
  .prg level, so IMO we should explore the possibilities 
  to avoid such .prg level error to cause a GPF in the first place.
  An RTE is a much friendlier behavior in this case.

- The vertical/horizontal problem is still present.

Brgds,
Viktor

Message-ID: <74911F05-EC42-4A83-AB39-4F08EA3B0136@syenar.hu>

Hi All,

With gtwin, in non-UNICODE build, HB_GTI_WINTITLE 
encodes the strings wrongly, as it uses OSCODEPAGE, 
which is set to ANSI for proper encoding, while in 
this case it should use OEM codepage because that's 
what console API requires.

Any idea what is the proper fix here?

Brgds,
Viktor

  * src/common/hbwince.c
    - Deleted definition of FreeResource(). It's noe used anywhere
      in Harbour, and its declaration was also missing.

  * contrib/hbqt/hbqt.h
  * contrib/hbqt/hbqt_destruct.cpp
    - Deleted no longer used macros: hbqt_ret_*().
    + Added TOFIX to hbqt_par_*() where essentially the GC 
      pointer type checking is completely worked around, which 
      makes it easy to create GPFs by passing wrong pointer 
      type to functions. Probably its unavoidable to introduce 
      parameter validation to HBQT wrappers. Such validation 
      could decide which types are accepted (f.e. objects and 
      parent objects, whether NULL is accepted or rejected).
      If not accepted a proper RTE should be thrown instead
      of letting the app GPF.
    + Added two TOFIXes where low-level parameter 
      retrieving function returns NULL.

1. It's necessary to update code in many different places and
   in some cases it makes code really unreadable
2. I do not know which missing functions are real WinCE limitation
   and which one are missing only in provided WinCE RTL, i.e. each
   new release of MinGWCE adds new functions. It's much easier to
   update single file then scan whole code for different:
      #if ! defined( HB_OS_WIN_CE ) || ...
   Please note that in few cases these are very important functions,
   i.e. without file lock functions any WinCE application cannot access
   concurrently the same DBF files.
3. We added functions to emulate environment. We can also add functions
   to emulate some other things like current directory and in such case
   it's good to keep the same code for desktop windows and WinCE.

BTW I also think that if some code can be compiled for WinCE and does
not create some fixed dependencies which break existing functionality
then we should compile it. I.e. with some minor fixes win_prn[123].c
can be compiled for WinCE by MinGWCE. In current version of WinCE RTL
low level functions do not exists but maybe they will be supported in
the future or even by some 3-rd party extensions i.e. there is 3-rd
party windows console for WinCE so it should be possible to use GTWIN
with it so we can provide GTWIN for WinCE builds but of course it cannot
be included in harbour.dll. Please also remember that new MinGW compilers
support direct linking with .dll libraries and do not need any
intermediate import libraries (BTW it's even suggested to eliminate
import libraries from new projects because direct linking with .DLLs
is faster and consumes less memory) so it's enough that user has valid
.dlls to link his application and use new functionality.

Yes, but it's guarded with ! HB_OS_WIN_CE, but it's not 
core Harbour's job to offer platform/compiler replacement 
functions for contib libs or 3rd party libs. We just bend 
the existing environment, and this is not good on the mid 
run. Such stuff should be done locally in each lib using 
guards.

Brgds,
Viktor

I understand this, but since in 95% of cases we're 
doing well with simple #if guards, I'm not sure all 
of these exceptions are valid one. F.e. the ones 
I mentioned are solely used in GTWVT and GTWVG, pretty 
easy to guard them, although f.e. in my mingw tests, 
they worked well, so they seem to be supported.

Maybe it's not true for all old versions of all 
compilers, but in this case it's still better to 
fine-tune it with version guards.

So what should be the final conclusion here?

I'd personally simply remove those few GDI 
WinCE stubs, as they seem to be supported and 
wait for feedback where they exactly fail. 
(f.e. I can't test msvcarm).

As for the rest, I don't know, we may leave 
them, but it would seem much cleaner and uniform 
to add guards to them, where they are used.

I somehow feel it very uncomfortable to publish 
system function form our own libs, be it .dlls 
or static libs.

Brgds,
Viktor

Assunto: [Harbour] SET PRINTER TO <cWinPrinterName>

Hi All,

Above extension works in xhb but is not supported 
in Harbour. Actually for good reason, so my intent 
is not to propose it for inclusion, but I still wonder 
what is the easiest way (least code change) to achieve 
the same result in Harbour.

[ NOTICE: This feature can only work if printer 
controls codes match those supported by the printer, 
and it's easily possible the printer doesn't support 
raw input _at all_. Plus it makes SET PRINTER TO 
incompatible. ]

---
SET PRINTER TO ( win_PrinterGetDefault() )
...
SET PRINTER TO
---

is equivalent to something like this in Harbour:

--- [untested]
LOCAL cTempName
FClose( hb_FTempCreateEx( @cTempName ) )
SET PRINTER TO ( cTempName )
...
SET PRINTER TO
win_PrintFileRaw( win_PrinterGetDefault(), cTempName )
FErase( cTempName )
---

Anyhow, this is my suggestion to xhb users wanting 
to switch to Harbour. If you know a better way, pls 
speak up.

Brgds,
Viktor

They are not supported by MinGWCE 0.55 I'm using in my
Linux box though they exists in header files so code can
be cleanly compiled. Fails when harbour.dll is created.
Which version of MinGWCE do you use?
0.55 is the last official release. I've downloaded 0.59.1
And checked that it also does not contain Arc(), FrameRect(),
FloodFill(), MulDiv() and few others functions. But it has
Beep() and file lock functions so I plan to enable then ASAP
when I installed it and verify it with real compilation and
link test. It will be nice if someone can also make runtime
tests at least in some WinCE emulator.
BTW I'm really happy that I have to update only single file
instead of grepping the whole code and reverting hacks for
functions missing in older MinGWCE versions and increasing
number of #ifdef... conditions in core code. As long as we
will not have new official release of MinGWCE I think it's
good to keep support also for 0.55.
I hope that someone can verify also MSVC and POCC WinCE builds.

If these functions are missing only in WinCE RTL then guarding
them in source code is IMO very bad and dirty solution which is
also hard to update.
It's much cleaner to add them in single file which is easy to
update when new compiler is released and supports some additional
functions. Otherwise we will left like in contrib where a lot of
code which probably can be compiled for WinCE is simple disabled
by !defined( HB_OS_WIN_CE ).

They are not supported by MinGWCE 0.55 and MinGWCE
0.59.1

I do not find anything clean in hacking core code
adding workarounds for missing functionality in some
chose compiler versions. IMO it's much cleaner to
keep all such hack in one place only and for sure
it's much easier to update only single file and instead
of introducing and reverting hacks in many different
files.

> I somehow feel it very uncomfortable to publish 
> system function form our own libs, be it .dlls 
> or static libs.

Me two but it's minor problem in comparison to adding:

#if !defined( HB_OS_WIN_CE ) || \
    ( defined( __MINGWCE__ ) && __MINGWCE__ >= ... ) ||
    ( defined( _MSC_VER ) && _MSC_VER >= ... ) ||
    ( defined( __POCC__ ) && __POCC__ >= ... ) ||
    [...]

in many different places and then updating each of them
when new compiler  is released. I simply do not have time
for it and I do not believe that will be updated by others.
One file I can update from time to time very easy. Additionally
I have documented in one place all missing functions so I can
immediately locate what may be wrong when user reports some
strange behavior.

Hi Przemek,

I understand these, but these are WinCE _OS_ calls, 
not RTL ones, so even if they are present in some 
buggy headers shipped with some compilers, the OS doesn't 
provide them, regardless of compiler. (there may be 
exceptions, but this should be clearly documented 
f.e. in MS headers).

The only guard that exist in hbwince.c is HB_OS_WIN_CE, 
(except for MulDiv, but this can be replaced by a 
low-level Harbour function with different name), so 
moving these to code is not something clumsy or horrible.

So overall, I don't really see the advantage of keeping 
dummy stubs for them, now that only a few ones are left. 
These are simple missing functions, and simply guarding 
them makes it much more obvious that the functionality 
is missing, and we also avoid any potential problems by 
exporting functions with Windows API names. Some 3rd 
parties may start to build on that, and it may also cause 
collisions, none of them very good.

IMO, if we absolutely want to stick to keep this 
special way of treating this regular problem, we at least 
have to use distinctive names, and use PP macros to 
map these to WinCE API names, f.e.:

BOOL WINAPI hbwince_LockFile( ... )
{
   ...
}

#ifdef WINCE [&& WHATEVER_COMPILER && WHATEVER_VERSION]
   BOOL WINAPI hbwince_LockFile( ... );
   #define Arc( ... ) hbwince_LockFile( ... )
#endif

This way the solution is much better controlled and 
less "hidden", with less side-effects.

[ BTW this method is used by sqlite3. ]

Plus some of the not so often used stubs could easily 
be dropped without major maintenance consequences.
(f.e. GDI ones).

Finally, contribs/3rd parties should never rely 
on above "stub service" of Harbour core, to avoid 
future problems. All of them should handle WinCE 
missing functions on their own (preferably 
by using portable Harbour core functions and adding 
guards as needed)

How does this seem as a possible direction?

Brgds,
Viktor

Some bits are there already, called wce/mingw. Was never tested though.

You mean not to try build hbcurl ?

I did it in readme_contrib.os2/readme.os2 and not in INSTALL, which is 
not proper place for this kind of info
I did not it in *.h* files because syntax is unknown by me
For example:
  {!mingw}libs=libcurl
  {mingw}libs=curldll
seem to be mingw or not mingw, but maybe we need "not mingw and os2", I 
am not sure
And I am not sure if my lib lists work fine in other OS/2 environments

As you are expert in *.h* files, you can make proper changes based on my 
lib lists for each contrib of readme_contrib.os2, included in previous 
message

Perhaps Pritpal or someone who know hbqt code can review these errors
If they do not belong to hbqt, I can report them to os2-qt developers

No, seemingly it's incompatibility between libcurl 
headers and OS/2 ow headers.

Maybe there exist some #defines for libcurl which 
are not automatically activated, but can nevertheless 
resolve the problem, the headers should be checked 
to tell more.

watcom is notoriously badly supported in projects, 
so it's a pain to maintain also in Harbour.

Yes. Detection is not fully automatic anyway, 
so all that needs to be done is to not configure 
it for this target.

Yes, each line should be guarded appropriately.

There are dozens of example for this in Harbour 
SVN, plus probably the help can help and the 
source is there with all supported filter 
keywords as a last resort. Usually it's enough 
to filter for compilers, compiler groups and 
platforms. CPU archs in some rare cases.

That's the task to solve.

That's exactly that I don't want to do.
It's guesswork since I can't test it. 
Moreover Harbour won't scale to well if 
I have to deal with every detail of every 
existing platform. .hbc files are pretty 
simple beasts, pls check them, and if you 
have questions or patch proposal, I'll 
try to help.

Not much feedback so far, so in such case the 
problem falls back to the hand of those who feel 
the itch the most. If this is you in this case, 
you can try to work it around locally and come 
to the list if you've found something. It can 
surely help the case.

Or, we can wait until someone fixes it.

Thank you. I'll test it.

Now I have two problems with hbmk2:
1. when static library is  created then to each library hbmk2 attach
   _hbmkaut.c with _hb_lnk_ForceLink_hbmk() function. It's seems to
   be redundant and when I try to merge few static libraries into single
   one I've got error message:
       multiple definition of `__hb_lnk_ForceLink_hbmk'
   HBMK2 should not attach any code to static libraries.
2. The second problem is with -hbdyn option.
   a) it ignores -shared option and always use harbour static libraries
   b) it puts libraries before obj files so GCC based compilers like MinGW
      ignores them.
   You can see the problem in practice if you try to create dynamic HWGUI
   library by:
      hbmk2 hwguidyn.hbp

Can you look at this?

It's a bad (and old) parenthesis typo in enabler condition.
I'll fix it ASAP.

Yes, it forcefully disabled in -hbdyn mode.
Probably because I didn't grasp the concept 
of shared-mode dynlibs. This rule can be easily 
disabled by commenting lines hbmk2.prg @ 2072-2074.
See what happens, and add missing bits for this 
feature if needed.

I reordered them, pls test, here it seems to work OK with mingw.

IMHO the correct direction to hbwin is allow printing JPGs and PNGs if takes it into memory.

Hello Everybody,

 

Please, Would it be possible to include the hbxml class in the harbour core
?

Actually to use it, it's necessary to link hbxp.lib.

No. I hope a superior implementation will eventually 
by included in Harbour, not necessarily in core though, 
but maybe as separate lib or wrapper lib to some known 
XML libs.

> Actually to use it, it?s necessary to link hbxp.lib.

Which is fine and doesn't have any drawbacks until 
above becomes a reality.

Let's say cairo function should return surface (GC pointer type). What 
is expected behavior of such function, if does not exist in current 
cairo version? hb_ret()? EG_UNSUPPORTED? etc....

IMO it's best if it returns failure just as if the underlying 
low-level function had failed, which means returning the same 
type as in normal cases, but HB_FALSE, NULL or other distinctive 
value. This is hb_retptr( NULL ) for low-level object creation 
functions.

If hb_retptr( NULL ) is returned, all other functions expecting 
this value should also handle it, by throwing an RTE in param 
checking phase.

Current hbcairo code uses RTE _right on creation_, which is 
IMO not ideal solution, as it's more difficult to handle it 
on .prg level.

So as a general advice, IMO RTE should only be thrown if 
wrong parameter was passed to a function, so code snippet 
like this one can be made sure to not RTE because of 
problems downstream in calls.

IF ! Empty( p := MYOBJECT_CREATE( "hello" ) )
    MYOBJECT_DO_SOMETHING_USEFUL( p, 100 )
ELSE
    /* Either the low-level call failed, 
       or low-level call was not available.
       Handle it gracefully. */
ENDIF

In current implementation whole above construct needs to be 
put inside BEGIN SEQUENCE to prepare for MYOBJECT_CREATE() 
failures.

Viktor

Very interesting, something he had read but did not know where.
Now to deal with the English.

Thanks Viktor, thanks Bruno by awakening the interest of the masters.

You have to fix your C compiler configuration.
It cannot find its own windows.h file.

David/Przemek,

Thanks for discussing this, if even in passing.  I too, like David, could
not find documentation as to locking schemes either, and therefore read
"DB_DBFLOCK_XHB64" as being specific to a 64 bit executable - and as such
never even tried it.  Upon trying it, however, my problems disappeared on
large data file manipulations - no more problems in either the write or read
portions of my executables/application.

Thanks for jogging my assumptions, and again, great release.

This is becoming more interesting  :-)

First thanks for your help

 >In the past I was answering for such questions over 10 times.
 >You may find these messages in the Harbour and xHarbour mailing

I read xhb-diff.txt and checked it
About "over 10 times":
I have seen before your info about "locking schemes" and so on, but in 
that cases was not relevant because does not exist a direct need and we 
usually do not go deep in those messages if we are not involved
For example, nobody have response for my recent messages about hbcurl, 
hbcairo, hbqt because are considered as irrelevant in this moment

Surprisely, except for source code, there are not reference of 
DB_DBFLOCK_VFP, "locking scheme" in doc files and even changelog file

My mail file for Harbour messages reached 105 Mb file size and no one 
editor in OS/2 can open it ( EPM, E, TEDIT, JEdit )  :-)
So I used many hours to split file in many files until it can open under 
50 Mb:
harbour0   21 Mb, 2006 to 2007
harbour08  26 Mb, 2008
harbour09a 31 Mb, 2009 first six months
harbour    27 Mb, 2009 rest six months

as we can see, 2009 was plenty of messages

... and surprisely too, in messages there are not too much info about 
dbf file sizes, "locking schemes".
Last and detailed message was around 30 Oct 2009

In source code we find info as this:

/* LOCK SCHEMES */
#define DB_DBFLOCK_DEFAULT    0
#define DB_DBFLOCK_CLIP       1
#define DB_DBFLOCK_CL53       2
#define DB_DBFLOCK_VFP        3
#define DB_DBFLOCK_CL53EXT    4
#define DB_DBFLOCK_XHB64      5

/* DBF locking schemes */
#define DBF_LOCKPOS_CLIP                  1000000000UL
#define DBF_LOCKPOS_CL53                  1000000000UL
#define DBF_LOCKPOS_VFP                   0x40000000UL
#define DBF_LOCKPOS_VFPX                  0x7ffffffeUL
#define DBF_LOCKPOS_CL53EXT               4000000000UL
#define DBF_LOCKPOS_XHB64                 HB_LL( 0x7FFFFFFF00000001 )

which are difficult to understand for a user without too much knowledge
For example, what is CL53EXT, VFPX ?

For me was hard to find information about this case
Perhaps info is there somewhere but I do not found it, so I suggest you 
to expand xhb-diff.txt or create a different one to clarify:
- DBF file size limit ( currently brief )
- "locking schemes"
so users can be oriented to file info in place to repeat in messages

I have more info provided by users
They are using my (x)Harbour systems with ADS 6.2x and VFP systems with 
unknown connection type to ADS

As you know ADS have two "Locking Modes":
  - Advantage Proprietary Locking
  - Advantage Compatibility Locking with Xbase Files
and I do not know which are technical details of each one, and if 
"compatibility mode" is based in VFP type or if 2 Gb size is involved

I checked and my systems are using "Proprietary mode" and "rights 
checkings" by default but I do not know what is using VFP

Along years I did not found detailed info in ADS docs about technical 
facts of both "locking modes", so I respect to use Proprietary

I do not know what is "range 0x6E6B27FF : 0x7FFFFFFE"  :-)
It is related to 2 Gb ?

First info of users was about failure reaching 2 Gb, but maybe what is 
happening is related to "locking scheme" and not DBF file size

Until now we confirmed it is not a file size problem and next tests must 
be for "locking schemes"

So I have to check what ways they are using to connect ADS-VFP and 
exactly what kind of errors are happening, including memo corruption 
perhaps for a different memo block size used

Do you have any sample code that shows the above hbcairo behavior?

Nope sorry, after second review I couldn't find exactly 
this case in hbcairo, which means it looks fine. 
(CAIRO_PATH_ITERATOR_CREATE() looked wrong at first glance)

Parameter checks and RTEs seem all in place, so all that needs 
to be done is fall back to return failure where cairo functions 
don't exist in the cairo version hbcairo is build against.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Pritpal,

Is it normal that I can scroll the line numbers without 
scrolling the edit area?

Also, in recent version, if I scroll the line numbers 
with the mouse-wheel, the edit area will zoom in (or out) 
after a while.

Hi

I was trying to understand encryption of dbf's and I wrote this test.

I didn't expect the last two lines of output (see end), but perhaps it is 
invalid to expect an encrypted file to be encrypted again? If so, shouldn't:
	dbcrypt->( dbinfo( DBI_ENCRYPT, "fredflintstone" ) )
cause an error or return false?

I found only 4 functions that needs to be fixed. See, pdf.c and png.c.

I still has a question that to do with this:

HB_FUNC( CAIRO_SURFACE_WRITE_TO_PNG )
{
#ifdef CAIRO_HAS_PNG_FUNCTIONS
    cairo_surface_t *  pSurface = hb_cairo_surface_param( 1 );
    if( pSurface )
       hb_retni( cairo_surface_write_to_png( pSurface, hb_parc( 2 ) ) );
#else
    hb_cairo_surface_param( 1 ); /* Parameter validation */
    hb_ret();                    /* There is no good CAIRO_STATUS_* */ 
#endif
}

This function should return error code. 0 means "no error". There is no 
good CAIRO_STATUS_* constant to indicate "no supported" (complete 
http://www.cairographics.org/manual/cairo-error-status.html#cairo-status-t 
). What action do you prefer return NIL, return -1, return 999 or some 
number larger than existing cairo errors. Something else...

Definitely an integer, I'd vote for -1.

Subject: [Harbour] HB_SERIALIZE
Message-ID: <4B56F471.2080102@dbtopas.lt>

Hi,


we had a problem with HB_[DE]SERIALIZE(). We've tried to use it to 
save/restore variable into file, but it has some side effects. F.e., it 
saves only key value pairs for the hash, but forgets about other things 
like case sensitive flag (perhaps also the default value). After complex 
variable is restored from file, application logic is broken, because the 
restored hashes has another behavior.

What should be expected HB_SERIALIZE() behavior? Are we going to fix it?

  * contrib/hbwin/Makefile
  + contrib/hbwin/wapi_wingdi.c
    + Added experimental WAPI wrappers for Windows GDI printing
      functions also found in win_prn1.c.
      This is partially to avoid the legacy interface which
      is a combination of WIN_* functions and Harbour class.
      Which may seem to make thing more complicated at first,
      but IME it provides a much cleaner interface, as you
      only have to adapt to MSDN docs.
      It's also a test bed for structure passing in WAPI
      situations. I've used hashes as the best looking
      solution, but even this has some things left to solve
      (like handling string types and returning values).
      Anyway it's a food for thought.

  * contrib/hbwin/hbwin.ch
    + Added WIN_DMORIENT_* constants.

  * contrib/hbwin/win_prn1.c
    ! Fixed to not accept raw pointers where HDC or HPEN is
      expected. I've added this feature last year, without
      making special mention of it in ChangeLog, so it was

I've been planing to implement it but so far I have had other things
more important for me so it's still on my TODO list.

No, it should not be. 
Actually I was experimenting with mouse wheel for
zooming feature but it turns out be having side effects.
Will be disabling it shortly.

It zooms-in only when you reach end of file
and zooms-out when you reach begining of file.
Not a very good solution. I have to either leave it
or rework. I have a clue how to : zoom only 
with Ctrl+Wheel.

I think this has nothing to do with the C compiler and harbour.
Please check your system maybe not have the exact font name or oem version and is associated with another.

I has to do with UNICODE setting, which is default for newer MSVC 
targets, f.e. the Itamar is using.

[ I'm drawing my own line chars, and I have no idea what a clean 
solution could be with fonts. Of course UNICODE mode can be 
forcefully disabled for the time being. ]

Viktor

Hi Pritpal,

I can still scroll the line numbers independently from

So you haven't made it well.
When you made clean build then this error message will disappear
for sure.
Before you report any problems with devel SVN code always make
clean build. Many of modifications needs full recompilation.
In this case new extension was added to compiler and you are
trying to compile new hbclass.ch code which needs this extension
using old harbour compiler binaries so the error message you
have is expected behavior.

Przemek

               it's necessary to restore original flags manually using
               hb_h*() functions to force resorting.

Hello Przemek

To reduce overall cluttering in Qt code I have to 
define this constant for every Qt class as :

#xtranslate QTextCursor( <x> ) => QTextCursor():configure( <x> )

I am wondering if there do exist a way to achieve it otherwise.

These modification and many others RDD related I made few years ago
when I was working on xHarbour CVS code and later they were ported
to Harbour without detail replication of all ChangeLog notes.
In this week I'll try to make some cleanups in existing locking
schemes and then I'll create their description which I'll commit
to SVN.

Don't you see that you are creating cross build for WinCE and mingwarm?
It uses native harbour compiler and you have to start rebuilding this
old native compiler in clean build.

Actually this works:

#xtranslate QTextDocument( <p> => QTextDocument():configure( <p>

Yes, it's LetoDb problem.
add to letodb/source/client/leto1.c just befor last line with

this code:
   #elif defined( HB_DATASEG_STARTUP )

Hi

#xtranslate QTextCursor( <x> ) => QTextCursor():configure( <x> )
#xtranslate QTextCursor( <x>  => QTextCursor():configure( <x> 

None of them works.
What is the correct syntax to achieve it ?

Why do you want to hide this method from app code?

I'm afraid that I do not know what is the problem and what you
want to do. The above PP rule is correct so it will work.
Anyhow if QTextCursor() is class function then each call to
QTextCursor() create new object of QTextCursor class.
Is it a problem?
Or maybe you only want to pass more parameters to :configure() method?
If yes then it's enough to change the PP rule to:
   #xtranslate QTextCursor( <x,...> ) => QTextCursor():configure( <x> )

This is the situation:

QTextCursor() is a class and :configure( xObject ) is its method resturning
self.

In application code I have frequent calls like this:

QTextDocument():configure( ::qEdit:document() ):setModified( .f. )
/
OR
/
qDoc := QTextDocument():configure( ::qEdit:document() )
qDoc:setModified( .t. )

I want to reduce code which must be eliminated as 

QTextDocument( ::qEdit:document() ):setModified( .f. )
/
OR
/
qDoc := QTextDocument( ::qEdit:document() )
qDoc:setModified( .t. )

But it GPFs because call QTextDocument() returns the class object itself.
So the above notation fails. I realize that this cannot be achieved like
this.

Or you may forward another solution.

Pritpal Bedi

Sorry to jump in, but IMO this is not very good idea.

This is like forcing "CONSTRUCTOR" or even worse 
"DEFAULT" methods to the class syntax. We don't have 
it for good reason (f.e. code readability).

This can save some typing but the time is lost 
many times when others are trying to find out what 
the code actually does.

Brgds,
Viktor

hbMK2 has a feature to issue different compiler switchs
for indivisual sources as is achieved in xMate?

My goal is to apply this feature in hbIDE but is not 
possible unless it is enabled in hbMK2.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

No, it's not possible. IMO it makes project maintenance 
much more complicated and error prone than necessary so 
I never make such thing, hence it didn't even cross my 
mind to implement it in hbmk2.

IMO if some sources need special treatment, almost all 
compiler options can be implemented in self-contained way 
right inside the source code using #pragmas or #defines.

Or, if a certain group of source files need special switches 
for some reason, they can be converted to a sub-project 
with their own .hbp file.

If there is some real-world scenario which this is trying 
to solve, I'd like to hear it, but I'm very sceptic about 
such feature. It's also very complicated to implement, 
both on configuration level and internally.

Brgds,
Viktor

Thank You very much!


BTW, I found code in last commit:
   if( * pszFile )
   {
      char * pszFileName = hb_strdup( pszFile );
      if( !hb_storclen_buffer( pszFileName, strlen( pszFileName ), 1 ) )
         hb_xfree( pszFileName );
   }
   else
      hb_storc( NULL, 1 );

Is it somehow better (by speed, etc) than:
   if( * pszFile )
      hb_storc( pszFile, 1 );
   else
      hb_storc( NULL, 1 );
or even:
   hb_storc( pszFile, 1 );
?

    Since what release this became necessary ? I ask this, because I 
need to add there ( __HARBOUR__ - 0 ) > some_value to provide 
compatibility with old releases.
    And why I didn't get rddsetdefault error without this fragment of 
code ( I tried a short test with Harbour 13587 ( 2010-01-14 18:21 
UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (pritpal@vouchcac.com)) ) ?

In this case pszFile points to memory area used by string item in the 1-st
parameter. It means that:
   hb_storc( pszFile, 1 );
may release pszFile before it's used clearing the 1-st item just before
assign. It's sth like:
   hb_storc( hb_parc( 1 ), 1 );

You do not have to. Above
   #elif defined( HB_DATASEG_STARTUP )
is enough to check if it's necessary in current versions and does not
break older ones. For older Harbour builds you will keep the code
covered by
   #elif defined( HB_MSC_STARTUP )
The final code will look like:

   #if defined( HB_PRAGMA_STARTUP )
      #pragma startup leto1__InitSymbols
      #pragma startup _hb_leto_rdd_init_
   #elif defined( HB_MSC_STARTUP )  // support for old Harbour version
      #if defined( HB_OS_WIN_64 )
      #pragma section( HB_MSC_START_SEGMENT, long, read )
      #endif
      #pragma data_seg( HB_MSC_START_SEGMENT )
      static HB_$INITSYM hb_vm_auto_leto1__InitSymbols = leto1__InitSymbols;
      static HB_$INITSYM hb_vm_auto_leto_rdd_init = _hb_leto_rdd_init_;
      #pragma data_seg()
   #elif defined( HB_DATASEG_STARTUP )
      #define HB_DATASEG_BODY    HB_DATASEG_FUNC( leto1__InitSymbols ) \
                                 HB_DATASEG_FUNC( _hb_leto_rdd_init_ )
      #include "hbiniseg.h"
   #endif

Probably you haven't used compiler which needs HB_DATASEG_STARTUP
initialization like MSC or OpenWatcom so it was not necessary to
register to change registration code. But here I only guess.

BTW In Makefile.linux[37] spaces are used instead of <TAB> what breaks
GNU make builds.
source/common/hbip.c[846] should be:
   socklen_t sin_size = ( socklen_t ) sizeof( localAddr );
Now now this code is in practice limited to MS-Windows and Linux.
I suggest to use Harbour API what should resolve the portability problems.
utils/manager/console.prg and utils/manager/manage.prg use:
   #include "include\rddleto.ch"
"\" breaks non MS-Windows builds and not relative path hacked compilation
to work only in some strict places. It has to be:
   #include "rddleto.ch"
and any include paths should be set by build scripts using -I parameter.

HTH,

You are using older MinGWCE version which redirects by macro GlobalLock()
and GlobalUnlock() to LocalLock()/LocalUnlock().
It's probably version 0.51
Please upgrade to version 0.55

Message-ID: <9257026e1001210343p2994b581qc65d8df9bf8c7c75@mail.gmail.com>

Today I had to use debug in a gtxwc app and I've found that boxes are
painted using the app CP chars.

My setup is:

...
   REQUEST HB_CODEPAGE_ITWIN
   SET( _SET_CODEPAGE, "ITWIN" )
   HB_SETTERMCP( "ITWIN", "ITWIN", FALSE )
...

I've read about HB_GTI_BOXCP in the ChangeLog and the setup seems correct.

What am I missing?

Should I add an HB_GTI_BOXCP explicit set?

best regards,
Lorenzo

Good news, thanks for your interest

 >perhaps for a different memo block size used

I checked in general what they are doing using ADS 6.2 with (x)Harbour 
systems, VFP and Delphi

What I found was not an ADSCDX files size limit, but operation under a 
"risk condition"
Due slow querys using ADS-VFP, years ago developers/users decided to use:
- Reading: querys opening directly files on disk in read-only
- Writing: using ADS (ADS OleDB provider)
They can work in this way because "Advantage Proprietary locking" mode 
open files in "deny-write" mode to let non-Advantage applications to 
read files. And this is the "risk-condition"
In this way even with ADS they have since years regular data corruption 
fixed mainly re-indexing

In ADS 9.x Sybase/Advantage developers closed this "risk-condition" as 
explained in their info:

----------------------------------------
Non-Exclusive Proprietary Locking

Advantage Database Server

In older versions of Advantage, proprietary locking did not open files
using an exclusive mode, instead it used a "deny write" open mode. While
this would allow non-Advantage applications access to the data files, it
could also lead to index corruption. Non-Advantage applications could
still lock bytes in the files causing Advantage read and write
operations to fail. For this reason the default proprietary open mode
was changed. If, however, you require other non-Advantage enabled
applications (such as backup software or reporting software) to open
files in a shared, read-only mode, this server option is available to
revert to older behavior.

For more details on proprietary locking, see Advantage Proprietary Locking.
----------------------------------------

In case I am checking obviously VFP developers must change their 
"reading" operations from "direct use of files" to "use ADS"


I sent this info mainly for you so you can check it and review if 
Harbour RDDs are or not working with this kind of "risk-condition" 
explained by Sybase/Advantage developers

( We know you may feel free to correct them  :-) )

Great! :) I should be more careful about such things in my code. In some 
cases it is not obvious that we have such situation.

Hi,

If you mean Windows 64-bit, it's included in unified 
installer since beta1, with libs for both MSVC and 
mingw64, and also x64 tools and .dll. If you mean OS X, 
it's also available in Intel 64-bit binary form.

For the rest it depends on builders, but for sure it's 
easy to build from official source on any 64-bit *nix 
system.

Brgds,
Viktor

The sample program supplied by 73 de DF7BE Wilfried works with Clipper5.2e
(the buffer is not saved).
But in Harbour it DO save the buffer when the user press ESC (and then 'J' to confirm)

  * src/rtl/memoedit.prg
    ! Fixed to not return edited memoedit buffer if :Saved
      flag is false. This patch is meant to fix sf.net bug #2936334.
      Again such a huge bug I wonder no one noticed it so far.
      MEMOEDIT() is the remaining last dark corners of Harbour RTL
      (maybe with AChoice()) which is not fully C5.x compatible,
      and it's a heap of patches and hacks to give answer to
      reported problems.
      Eventually some concerned MEMOEDIT() user will have to rework
      it like we did with GET/TBROWSE to give a proper fix to all
      reported issues.
      (F.e. in TEditor() there is a bug where chars are stuffed to
      the wrong position if initially we position cursor after EOL.
      Try by deleting text.txt in attached example.)
      Please test, review, fixme, look also for regressions.
    + Added initial support for ME_PAST Xbase++ event. Please test,
      I didn't make any testing against Xbase++.

  * contrib/hbwin/wapi_wingdi.c
    + WAPI_SELECTOBJECT() got support for HBRUSH.

  * contrib/hbwin/win_prn1.c
    + Added two TOFIX comments to serious security holes and potential
      GPFs to bitmap handling functions. Enough to load a malformed or
      corrupted .bmp file to exploit it.
      Any takers for fixing them?

Hi!

It was excellent this option! I would just suggest to put this

Please note that in xHarbour there is protections against code like:
   hb_storc( hb_parc( 1 ), 1 );
anyhow this protection helps only in such limited situation and it's
not general solution so it should not be implemented in core code.
The NETIO_DECODE() code clearly shows why, f.e.:

   hb_storc( pszFile, 1 );
   hb_storc( pszServer, 2 );
   hb_storni( iPort, 3 );
   hb_storni( iTimeOut, 4 );
   hb_storclen( pszPasswd, iPassLen, 5 );
   hb_storni( iLevel, 6 );
   hb_storni( iStrategy, 7 );

it's still not correct though:
   hb_storc( pszFile, 1 );
is safe. The problem is caused by the unsafe API and any local hack
do not help at all because it's exploited by:
   hb_storclen( pszPasswd, iPassLen, 5 );
It can be resolved in two ways. One of them I used in new string API
I recently added where such problems does not exist. Just simply it's
enough to call:
   hb_strfree( hFullName );
after setting all parameters. With such API programmer fully control
the life of string buffers himself and does not have to worry that some
other code freed or reallocated memory accessible by previously extracted
pointers.

No, but please remember that in the future we add strong typing.
If you will want to enable type protection in your code then you
will have to precisely declare parameters with type in your class
definition so it's possible that you will make reverted modification.

Message-ID: <6943770e1001211515k60f16edcu1b24722959a5d79d@mail.gmail.com>

I got some complaints from users that mails were not delivered.... I
then went to smtp logs and found strange behaviours. I dug again the
code and found again that SMTP protocol is not implemented in the
code... everything is based on timeouts and the idea that the server
replies really really quickly (with a 1 second reply the server must
be quick !!!!)

I then made these changes to adhere a bit more to the protocol...in
order of chunks:
- nTimeOut defaults to 10 seconds
- check for actually receiving "250 " to EHLO and not waiting for timeout
- don't wait for timeout
- check for actually receiving "250 " to HELO and not waiting for timeout

I don't understand why it tries the EHLO first and then HELO because
the same "basic" commands are valid in both cases... you should revert
to HELO only if server (and it should be a REALLY OLD server) gives
error on HELO...
Instead it closes the transaction and open a new one !

Other issue is Open/OpenSecure... they differ only to HELO/EHLO
parameter sent to server (so it should be a parameter) but EHLO is NOT
only for "secure" connections, but a way to get server capabilities,
like for example maximum mail size, and login/encription
possibilities...

I'm do not follow xHarbour changes any more, but I guess you are talking 
about hb_itemPutCL():
620           if( szText == pItem->item.asString.value )
621           {
622             pItem->item.asString.value[ ulLen ] = '\0';
623             pItem->item.asString.length = ulLen;
624
625             return pItem;
626           }

I guess because in hb_itemPutC() (in Harbour) code:
  szText = ( char * ) hb_xmemcpy( hb_xgrab( ulAlloc ), szText, ulAlloc );
is executed before:
   hb_itemClear( pItem );

What about code:
    cI := "x127.0.0.1:2941:password:filename"
    cI := SUBSTR(cI, 2) // Let's create dynamic string instead of PCODE
    NETIO_DECODE(cI,,,,@cI) // I want to reuse cI value for password
Is this code safe in current version of NETIO_DECODE()?

What is another way?


Sometimes I understand, the things that always seemed simple are not such.

Thanks, I'll commit your patch in the next commit.

Note I'm not the author of this code, and never analyzed 
it in depth. As far I know the code, for sure it can have 
problems, even in the features I've added, but I can't 
easily address the issues/questions you list.

I trust your judgment though, so please continue with your 
patches, I'll keep adding them to SVN.

[ Just one small thing: pls .zip the patches, otherwise 
I have to manually apply them, which is slow and error 
prone. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

i understand but declaring parameters both in class definition and in
method implementation is a duplication of code and as we've seen a
source of ( formal ) errors.

In class(y) doc methods are always declared without any parameter.

It would be better to have only one method declaration/implementation
inside the class definition but if it's not possible declaring methods
without parameters seems to be the "second best" solution.

Lorenzo

    + Added HBQPlainTextEdit() class which implements some constructs
      which were not possible in pure prg code. The underlying code has
      been borrowed from TextEdit.c of QWriter - a work of 
      Gancov Kostya <kossne@mail.ru>, a big thank you. The code has been
      extensively formatted and changed to adopt to Harbour standards.
      
      The direct benefits by adopting this class are:
        :
        * Current line highlighting is absolutely ok now.
        * Line numbers display is extremely fast and optimized.
        * Book-marks are shown at the left of line-numbers.
        * Parenthesis matching is absolutely delightful.
        * To Upper/Lower implementation is accurate spanning many lines.
        * Stream commenting is made possible.
        * Book-marks management is smooth.

          In IDE book-marks are implemented in different way than 
          most IDE's offer. Here is the description:
            * Click on "Toggle Mark" icon on the toolbar.
            * A small dot will appear on the left of current line.
            * Look at status-bar, a small colored pushbutton will appear.
            * Navigate the document as usual.
            * Click on the colored push button staying in statusbar.
            * The editing cursor will stay at book-mark represented by 
                that colored button and current line will appear highlighted
                with the same color as that of button.
            * Navigate to another location and click again on "Toggle Mark" icon.
            * A new dot and one more colored button will appear in the statusbar.
            * You can create 6 book marks as such and all will have different colors.
            * You can click on any of desired usage.
            * To delete a book-mark click on the button then "Toggle Mark"
            * One button at the right will disappear.
            * All tabs will contain their own book-marks.
            * And every split window will have its own.
            * Navigating different tabs or split windows will rearrange the 
                buttons according to its own settings.
     
      ; QUESTION : Is it worth the effort to save book-marks settings for next session?

I'm preparing to do merging in 2.0

1)
Please try to isolate commits with [TOMERGE 2.0] so we don't have, in
a single commit, hunks that must be ported and hunks that shouldn't...

I cherry-picked the commits (about 32 up to now) that should be ported
and now I will try to expunge all the hunks that shouldn't be ported.
Changelog should be a manual thing since the patch will never apply...

Should I create a single "big-patch" with all 32 in one ? or should I
keep them separated ?
Should it be called 2.0.1 ? (I saw you are using 2.0.1 for current
development branch....) Or 2.0.0 sp 1 ?

[TOMERGE 2.0] in branch CHANGELOG should be changed to... ? MERGEDFROTRUNK ?
[TOMERGE 2.0] in trunk should be modified to... ?

2)
When you created the 2.0.0 branch, did you perhaps did something like:
svn mv trunk harbour-2.0
svn cp newbranch trunk
I ask because the conversion from svn to hg had some strange results
and I can't understand what happened.

That is good of you.

I noticed that there were a few bug fixes that did not appear to be marked with 
TOMERGE, did you notice them?

If not I will try and have a look through the ChangeLog and report them. As 
ever, I am behind the curve and I have not updated my repository for quite a while.

No, I didn't.
Up to now I exported all the single revs, one per file, so I have, for
example, patch-43-44.diff
I then grep TOMERGE 2 to select all the diffs, and manually selecting
a couple that have TOMERGE applied in a subsequent commit.

My idea is then to visually inspect each patch to remove  not
applicable hunks. For Changelog I'm waiting info from main committers
- a single big-patch, single patches, and what should be inserted in
Changelog

Please report them in a way that can be easily understood which commit
they belong to.

I'll try... but sometimes I just stick [TOMERGE 2.0] later, 
because I forget about it or I'm unsure about back-porting 
at commit time (= before feedback from users / testing).

Okay.

> Should I create a single "big-patch" with all 32 in one ? or should I
> keep them separated ?

Single "big patch" is fine. Although pls keep all 
the relevant sections of ChangeLog entries with their 
original time/user headers.

> Should it be called 2.0.1 ? (I saw you are using 2.0.1 for current
> development branch....) Or 2.0.0 sp 1 ?

It should be called 2.0.1 eventually, but this will only be important 
when we do a release from it.

If you want to do it now, first I should change trunk to 
version 2.1.0dev, then you can switch branch to 2.0.1dev.

I'll do the trunk part in a next commit.

> [TOMERGE 2.0] in branch CHANGELOG should be changed to... ? MERGEDFROTRUNK ?
> [TOMERGE 2.0] in trunk should be modified to... ?

Both: [MERGED 2.0]

In 2.0.x branch I think it's optional, since by default 
we can assume that everything comes from trunk, since no 
active / parallel development is done in the branch.

So, if you agree with it, just drop this markup from branch.

I used these commands:
   svn copy https://.../harbour-project/trunk/harbour        https://.../harbour-project/branches/harbour-2.0
   svn copy https://.../harbour-project/branches/harbour-2.0 https://.../harbour-project/tags/harbour-2.0.0

Just a Harbour SVN related comment:

As for code going into Harbour SVN, I'd like to ask 
everyone to always add full parameter list to declaration 
too. This usually gives a good overview of the class 
functionality and usage, and in many places INLINE METHODs 
are used, which would need parameters in declaration anyway, 
so to avoid a "hybrid" look, the parameter list is best to be 
put for every declaration. It's also a nice way to visibly 
differentiate methods from variable declarations in 
class header code.

[ And true, eventually class declaration may go into a 
headers, or be needed for strong typing. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

I've just check current xHarbour code and also next lines:
627           else if( szText > pItem->item.asString.value && szText <= pItem->item.asString.value + pItem->item.asString.length )
...
634           }
checks for overlapped regions.

Anyhow it's good to refresh mind sometimes ;-).
I forgot that few years ago I updated Harbour code to call hb_xgrab()
before hb_itemClear() in hb_itemPutC[L]() so it's also safe to make:
   hb_storc( hb_parc( 1 ), 1 );
anyhow as I said before it helps only in this particular case and the
problem can be still exploited by accessing different items.

Yes, I added it intentionally and I forgot about it. It means that we
can simplify NETIO_DECODE() code and only have to keep strict order
of hb_stor*() calls. I'll commit it.

In this case nothing wrong because number of reference counters to cI
is 2: 1 for the cI local variable and 1 for the 1-st netio_decode()
parameter so assign to @cI does not change it.
But the problem can be exploited if you change the last line of your
code to:
    NETIO_DECODE(@cI,,,,@cI)
in such case the reference counter for the string item stored in cI is 1
and any assignment to the 1-st or the 5-th parameter can damage both
pointers previously returned by hb_parc( 1 ) and hb_parc( 5 ).

If not programmer locks and unlock the memory area then it has to be done
by system. In the second version HVM has to lock the pointers returned
by hb_parc*() functions until some arbitrary point is reach, i.e.
until function returns. It means that when you call hb_parc( <n> )
1-st time then HVM creates internally hString reference just like
hb_parstr*() functions and attach it to function frame. When function
frame is removed then all such pointers are automatically freed so
each memory buffers returned by hb_parc*() functions are valid for
whole function life.

> Sometimes I understand, the things that always seemed simple are not such.

It's simple but programmers have to remember that functions like
hb_parc*() or hb_arrayGetItemPtr() return pointers to area which can
be damage by other function calls. Such API does not give any pointer
protection so it's danger.

Yes it is. But I do not think that most of people agree with your
conclusion because it's not the source of formal errors but method
of detecting real errors when declaration and implementation is different.
If you do not like declarations at all then it's your choice but usually
users like strong typing and similar features. They help to locate
errors and typos at compile time. I.e. I still miss compile time support
for method name verification so when I make typo like:
   oPrn:AskProperites := .T.
the error is generated at runtime only.

> In class(y) doc methods are always declared without any parameter.

Yes, in Classy it's illegal to use any parameters information in class
declaration. Anyhow it also uses some type of declaration for class
definition. I do not find big difference between validation only method
name and validation of method name with parameters. For people who do
not like declarations at all probably it will be better to make sth like:

   create class mysls
      method mth1
         ? mth1
      return self
      method mth2
         ? mth2
      return self
   endclass

Such version really eliminates declarations so you may want to create
new PP rules for class creation which will work in above way. Otherwise
you still have to make at least partial declarations so there is always
chance that you create code where declaration and implementation is
different.

> It would be better to have only one method declaration/implementation

See above. Just simply eliminate declarations at all.
But I do not think you will win too much in such way,
All time you safe eliminating declaration you will have
to invest in documentation or you will have to look for
the code to check exact method names and parameters.

Class declaration is minimal class description which is
usually very usable in the future when such class is used.
Especially if you are working in a team or when code it
actively developed for years.
Anyhow it's programmer your choice what to chose and it's
the reason why I enabled such verification only optionally
for -w3 and higher level warning and even in such case leaving
Class(y) compatible declaration method which does not force
strict parameter validation.

That's actually the reason I still keep out from 
using OO in Harbour (Clipper). Very easy to create 
RTE due to simple typo. And simple typos happen often.

Well, IMO it could be enabled all the time, because 
it's such a good tool to help creating good code.

I guess this would lead to hard debate, but Clipper 
(and thus Harbour) .prg code can be very sloppy and 
the same thing can be written in dozens of syntax 
variations. Maybe this is regarded a "strength" by 
some programmers, but I think it's one of the barriers 
to move Harbour closer to "modern" languages like 
f.e. C#, where it's much more difficult to write 
bad or dubiously looking code (= hard to read for 
anyone else but the writer).

Any steps to change this in Harbour can only be gradual 
while keeping way to stay fully compatible, but IMO 
it would be great if Harbour compiler could help even 
more to create cleaner, better code with less RTE 
traps and better readability. One tool is to provide 
_less_ options (synonyms) to express the same thing, 
plus features like strong typing. Anyway it's probably 
still too early to think about these things yet.

Brgds,
Viktor

I'm still waiting for confirmation and regression 
testing, but if it's the right fix it's definitely TOMERGE.

Same as above. MEMOEDIT() is notorious to regress 
as we don't have any unit tests. But also TOMERGE if right.

Rest looks fine.

Hi Przemek,

What's your opinion in extending 
str API functions expecting an item 
(f.e. hb_itemGetStr()) to also check 
for pItem being NULL and go to default 
path in this case?

So this:
  if( HB_IS_STRING( pItem ) )

would be changed to this:
  if( pItem && HB_IS_STRING( pItem ) )

Brgds,
Viktor

So, this should be also fixed. NETIO_DECODE(@cI,,,,@cI) sounds a little 
nonsense, but it could be result of typo and generate GPF, corrupt 
memory, etc.

Yes, it should be modified to work in such way just like other
hb_item*() functions. I'll commit this modification ASAP.

And now we are touching the area which cannot be easy fixed without
switching to new API. Such problem can be exploited in many ways.
Just simply after each hb_stor*() function or even hb_ret*() if you
haven't verified what exactly is modified then you should expect that
all pointers to string item buffers or array items or anything like
that has been discarded. I.e. hb_itemClear() can activate destructor
which will remove or resize some arrays removing the original items
or changing the memory addresses of existing items for which you keep
pointers retrieved by hb_arrayGetItemPtr() or hb_hashGetItemPtr().
It means that you can find many different similar places in Harbour
or Clipper source code where this problem can be exploited. Adding
workaround in single place is not a solution. It has to be resolved
by alternative API which introduce item protection. Such protection
well implemented may give also item write protection in MT mode.
Anyhow it will not be Clipper or current Harbour compatible C API.
Maybe in the future we will create sth like that. I'm systematically
adding new functions like hb_array[SG]et*() or recently added string
functions which do not cause such problems for user code or give
explicit interface for such protection.
Now let's see how we can use it to implement Unicode support.
If it's possible in reasonable time to replace all string related
functions in the whole Harbour SVN code to work with Unicode items
then we can think about replacing also other functions and switching
to new API.
Harbour is not my fulltime job so I do not want to start global
modifications which I cannot finish in reasonable time so it's
possible that it will never happen :-(

Przemek

This seems to indicate that my newfound usage of hb_hashGetCItemPtr() 
in hbwin is not safe in case the hash variable is shared between 
threads. Is this right?

Anyway I think it would be useful to add hash APIs like this:
   hb_hash[Set|Get|Add]CItem*()
where * is 'NL', 'C'/'CPtr', 'NI', 'NInt', 'L', etc. just like 
we have already for arrays and items.

In above skeleton I means 'Set' to set the hash if the key 
already existed, while 'Add' to add a new item if it didn't 
and set it. Maybe it can be made more compact.

Also the .cpp file does seem to be missing.

Plus the hbqt_hbqplaintextedit.h file is missing 
from MOC_HEADERS section in filelist.mk.

MOC_HEADERS section is correct.
Probably it reported because it could not find any of 
the source/header.

Hope I have recovered sleep-hangover.

Thank you, can you pls fix filelist.mk ? The new header 
is missing from it, so MOC file won't be generated for it.

I will test above code shortly.

A rule in MT: 
   The dialogs in another threads have to be destroyed by 
   the program code and only then destroy the main window. I was unable 
   to cover this problem. 

I will see what can be done in this context.

BTW : did you find that other dialogs were behving properly ?
I have many changelog notices to describe this issue with MT and 
multi dialogs.

Pritpal Bedi

Maybe it's related: Plain demoqt built in -mt 
will also behave strangely, f.e. second window is slowly 
or not catching any events. I've reported this twice 
in the past.

Hi Tamas,

Pls note that these two failures are result of not 
rebuilt _native Harbour binaries_ used to create these 
cross-builds.

I'd appreciate if you could resend these results 
after rebuilding Linux Harbour binaries.

   * updated hb_itemCopyStr*() functions to set '\0' in the buffer if not

   * updated hb_itemCopyStr to return number of characters which could be
     stored in buffer if buffer when passed buffer is NULL and its size is 0
     Now all hb_itemCopyStr*() functions can be used to retirve the size in
     character of destination string by:
         ulSize = hb_itemCopyStr*( pItem ..., NULL, 0 )

I'm not sure if this could be done and that way, but it would be nice to 
have some better cooperation in development. I think more developers can 
help, if large modifications can be divided into smaller pieces and the 
road of reaching the final goal is clear for more developers.

That's very true.

Many times I feel that it's only me who wants 
some changes, which makes me slowly but painfully 
advance alone (for the most part). Not very 
efficient and even I wonder for how long I can 
keep it up.

I can see two large areas which are pending / in 
progress and can easily be split into multiple / parallel 
steps:

- "type cleanup" - The goal is simple:
  Replace all Windows types present in portable 
  Harbour code with native Harbour types (HB_*).
- Harbour native "unicodization".
  (perhaps joint with API reform)

Plus two shorter term tasks:

+1 Windows .dll handling both 32-bit and 64-bit.
+2 hbwin/hbqt issues with GC reference counting.

Brgds,
Viktor

      like point and rect, for anything more complicated hash is
      a much convenient answer (don't have to remember structure

Hi!

I have a production system based on hbnetio with rpc support that is
working very well and would like to thank all and especially to
Przemek for this wonderful tool! For this I have changed the sample
hbnetio/utils/netiosrv.prg adding a few new features you'd like to
share with you but do not know if it will be useful to someone else.
Here are some details that I implemented in this version:

* Added more commands:
 clear   - Clear screen.
 config  - Show server configuration.
 help    - Display help.
 quit    - Stop server and exit.
 sysinfo - Show system/build information.
* Supported keystrokes:
 Up      - Move up on historic list.
 Down    - Move down on historic list.
 TAB     - Complete command.
 Alt+V   - Paste Clipboard contents (if apropriate).

* Adjusted the positioning of cursor on navigate through history

Attached I send the version that changed with the sources and also
the. Diff for comparison. Again thank you for this great tool!

Regards,
Vailton Renato

Message-ID: <2386af1b1001221127wea285a3w96208c2302afaeb5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, Przemek

After creating dbf file:

 dbcreate("TEST", {{'F1', 'N', 10, 0}})

content in hex:

0000: 03 6E 01 16 00 00 00 00  42 00 0B 00 00 00 00 00
0010: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0020: 46 31 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 4E 00 00 00 00
0030: 0A 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0040: 0D 00 20

Note last symbol (0x20)

Now after appending one deleted record:

 dbAppend(); dbDelete()

0000: 03 6E 01 16 01 00 00 00  42 00 0B 00 00 00 00 00
0010: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0020: 46 31 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 4E 00 00 00 00
0030: 0A 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0040: 0D 00 2A 20 20 20 20 20  20 20 20 20 20 1A

And after packing:

 __dbPack()

0000: 03 6E 01 16 00 00 00 00  42 00 0B 00 00 00 00 00
0010: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0020: 46 31 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 4E 00 00 00 00
0030: 0A 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0040: 0D 00 1A

Last symbol changed from 0x20 to 0x1A
Is this expected ?

No. It's the result of typo in one of modifications I made over year
ago. It does not have any bad side effects but of course I'll fix it.
Thank you for the information.

Can you see what you did wrong with your code:


// Ask for pass
oSLE2 := xbpSLE():New(oDlg:drawingarea,,{m->COL_PX*3,m->ROW_PX*3},
{m->COL_PX*15,m->ROW_PX})
oSle2:bufferLength  := 15
oSle1:dataLink      := {|x| IIf( x==NIL, cP, cP := UPPER(x) ) }
oSle2:unReadable    := .T.
oSle2:Create()
oSle2:SetData()

The example works correctly if you close the other 
opened window before closing main. On my XP machine 
the above code is working fine even if I close the main
without closing the other windows. But I am sure GPF can
appear in this case.

Some more thoughts are needed...

You are mixing files from different downloads.
Check your hbqt.h

This is the latest one.

Sorry, my first reply is invalid.
Error message is different.
It suggests that you have missing line in QSizeGrip.cpp

#include <QtGui/QSizeGrip>

Message-ID: <6943770e1001221618t4c957d8ehcddb08dff3fbe8bc@mail.gmail.com>

I proceeded with the merge work and I found some problems in the process...

1) hbtrace.c
only some changes to hbtrace are marked TOMERGE and so the marked
patches don't apply.
Can I use the TRUNK version ?

2) hbmk2.pt_BR.po
there are several commits for this file and for some of them the label
[TOMERGE] was written and then removed... PLEASE don't do it again. If
a file "file.prg" has a "complicated" history due to test with poor
results there are two possibilities: keep the [TOMERGE] label on every
revision on clearly say in the commit "take directly this revision
dropping the history" actually collapsing several commits into one.
Can I use the TRUNK version ?

3) 2010-01-05 18:48 UTC+0100 Viktor Szakats
only in hbmk2.pt_BR.po, probably due to not applied patches at point 2.

4) 2009-12-31 12:43 UTC+0100 Przemyslaw Czerpak
it doesn't apply, but I need to investigate better (probably due to
some missing previous codepage patches)
Should all codepage rfelated patches be MERGED ?

5) 2010-01-13 20:14 UTC+0100
it doesn't apply because it must be applied to lines added by
"2010-01-13 09:37 UTC+0100 Przemyslaw Czerpak" that was not marked as
TOMERGE that added some similar lines in the same lines confusing the
patch system. Should I MERGE it ?

6) 2010-01-18 13:27 UTC+0100
mapi.c doesn't apply for different formatting.... no problem


PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, in order to not destroy the work I have done up
to now, please DON'T make changes to ChangeLog but instead tell me in
this message what should I do !

29 patches apply cleanly.

Thank you

Yes, this line is since day ONE.
How come that you are experiencing this problem only today?

I cannot suggest anything, just see in your Qt distro about QSizeGrip
file and find out what has caused this problem.

I think you can't. Several features were added 
to this component, so it doesn't count as pure 
bugfix. To avoid regressions, no new features 
should be back-ported to 2.0.x as a rule.

(as for 'don't do it again': you can safely assume 
that such commits are only done when there is some 
serious issues along the way, in this case it was 
codepage problems came at last minute before release.
That's life, such thing can happen in development ,
unfortunately. Anyway, multiple modification should 
not pose a problem in general.)

I'm not sure what you mean, but this specific 
patch of this file shouldn't be merged.

The hbmk2.prg -warn fix should go though, it's definitely 
a manual merge, since multiple changes were done in 
this one commit.

This should go as is. hbext*.ch files may need 
to be applied manually.

This change is not marked as TOMERGE, so you shouldn't.

I can't see the exact problem, but the fix it rightly 
marked as TOMERGE, maybe it needs to be manually applied.

Thank you. My only comment is that nobody ever told 
that patches should or would apply cleanly :( There are 
cases when things has to be done manually. IMO it's 
almost impossible to design daily "life" around making 
back-porting patches a no-brainer. [I've went through 
it in 1.0.1, which I did fully manually BTW.]

Based on merging experiences we may try to create some 
basic committing rules to help the process though, but 
IMO there is no way to _fully_ avoid automatic merge issues.

One such rule could be to commit fixes in distinct commits, 
if there is any chance that fix needs to be back-ported 
"AKA [TOMERGE 2.0]-ed".

Brgds,
Viktor

If possible, please mark them as [TOMERGE 2.0] in a 
new commit, if you forgot to mark it at first. (in this 
case maybe only after Francesco has finished this job)

You can merger all my commits. In practice the short answer is:
merge everything except new type modifications (HB_SIZE, HB_ISIZ,
HB_BOOL, ...)

It's really not fun to be ignored like that, but 
anyway I report again that demoxbp, built with 'hbmk2 demoxbp -mt' 
then run, selecting "Dialog | One more instance" 
will open a new window which is unusable, mouse works 
strangely, keys are not accepted, etc. When I open a 3rd 
one it first worked, but then has fallen back to the 
same faulty state. Moving the mouse over the different 
dialog also results in strange focusing behavior, sometimes 
repaint are done wrongly, etc.

Is this normal in HBQT + HBXBP? Am I the only one 
experiencing this?

Brgds,
Viktor

And BTW: It consumes 100% CPU.

After closing all three dialog (in reverse order), 
the 100% CPU consumption stays and the app keeps 
running with no visible window.

I reported many times, BTW never ignored your messages, that
hbQT have many MT issues which are primarily based on Qt's 
paint engine and events dealing with painting in MT scenario.
I have made extensive tests and applied different approaches,
but of no positive results. I do not know how to cover it.
Probably I need more hands in this matter, specially Marcos Gambet,
as seems to have worked with Qt for a longer period.

NOTE: in gtqtc, this issue is not present as I am handelling all the
         gdi stuff myself. Probably I have to discover how to handle
         this in hbQT GUI.

Okay, thank you, for me it's enough if you're aware

Damm !!
Silly me !
I'm sorry for troubling you

What about the other issues ?
1) Modality of login window
2) Destroying login dialog gives RTE
3) can?t hide minimize maximize and system menu of login dialog

Any way, I will correct my stupid mistake and come with this.
I pretend to do some masked imput also. I have some idea of how to do it.
What I couldn?t do is redirect ENTER to TAB.

Thank you Pritpal !
Sure you`re right. Now I've found time to begin migrating my systems to 
hb+qt so I will come with many more questions. I'm doing a basic app 
framework to build a sytem upon so all comunity has an example of qt-xbp 
style.

Regards
Angel

PD: I've also commanded Diego ( the guy that works with me ) to test 
hbide on linux. He will suscribe this list soon with suggestions. BTW he 
is using ARCH Linux with KDE and all is working fine and fast on that 
distribution.

Message-ID: <27282667.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello everybody,

Recently Angel Pais posted an 100% Xbase++ code 
application ( only one direct call to hbQT ) which I tried
with hbIDE directly, thinking myself as a newbee to have 
fun with it. Below are the steps I employed :

1. Created a shortcut pointing towards E:\harbour\contrib\hbide\hbide.exe

2. In shortcut icon's Properties dialog I changed the "Target" as 
    E:\harbour\contrib\hbide\hbide.exe 
        =>
    E:\harbour\contrib\hbide\hbide.exe  "E:\dev_projects\hbide\hbide.ini"
    E:\dev_projects\hbide\hbide.ini is the projects startup file.

3. E:\dev_projects\hbide\ is a folder where I am keeping all projects.

4. Created a subfolder E:\dev_projects\hbide\angel_pais\ to keep 
    Angel's project files, sources only. Downloaded project sources
    and unzipped in this folder.

5. Clicked on shortcut icon on desktop and invoked hbIDE.

6. Blank, no projects yet.

7. Right-clicked on "Projects" tree  node, and selected "New Project",
   Project Properties Dialog opens.

8. Filled the fields as:
      Project Title: Angel Pais - Amigo WQ
      Location: E:/dev_projects/hbide/angel_pais
      Working Folder :
      Destination :
      Output Name : amigo
      Compile Link Flags : 

9. In sources tab:
      E:/dev_projects/hbide/angel_pais/amigowq.rc
      E:/dev_projects/hbide/angel_pais/appLogin.prg
      E:/dev_projects/hbide/angel_pais/AppMain.prg
      E:/dev_projects/hbide/angel_pais/appVer.prg
      E:/dev_projects/hbide/angel_pais/lib/fechas.prg
      E:/dev_projects/hbide/angel_pais/lib/qMsg.prg

10. Pushed <Save and Exit> - I could see this project 
     under "Executables" node.

11. Right-clicked on "Angel Pais - Amigo" node and selected
     "Build Project".

12. In "Output Console" I received :
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project [ Angel Pais - Amigo WQ ]    Launch [ No ]    Rebuild [ No ]   
Started [ 18:29:45 ]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13 :((- Nothing happened. I knew what is the reason - 
    hbIDE.exe desktop shortcut was unaware of Harbour 
   and Qt's environment. So,

14. I opened the development console where Harbour and Qt's
     environment is fired with a batch file, i.e., harbour/contrib/hbide.

15. I executed 
     E:\harbour\contrib\hbide\hbide.exe  "E:\dev_projects\hbide\hbide.ini"
     on the command line, hbIDE appeared on the screen.

16. Repeated step 11.

17. Received in Output Console:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project [ Angel Pais - Amigo WQ ]    Launch [ No ]    Rebuild [ No ]   
Started [ 18:36:27 ]

29. The line below was highlighted with blue color:
E:/dev_projects/hbide/angel_pais/AppMain.prg(70) Warning W0001 Ambiguous
reference 'HBQT_RELEASE_WITH_DELETE'

30. Doule-click on this line opened the "AppMain.prg" in the only editor
tab,
     cursor was staying at line#70. I knew that this function has been
depricated,
     so I commented out this line with <Edit><Block Comment> option, clicked
<Save>
     icon and repeated step 11, and got following output:

32. <Exit Code [ 0 ] was good enough an indication that project has been
built successfully.

33. Right-clicked on "Angel Pais - Amigo" node and selected "Launch", the
result:

34. WOW, I could see the amigo.exe in action.

I know that this will not happen if you have not setup your environment to 
compile with hbQT and Qt dlls are not known to the hbIDE. At present this is
the only
missing feature in hbIDE to centralize your all projects. I will address
this issue 
shortly after covering some editing features which are a MUST in an IDE.

Hope that above case-study will facilitate beginers to adopt hbIDE, may be 
in a limited manner, for their few of the projects.

Perhaps it would be useful to add an option to HBIDE to 
configure location of hbmk2.exe. If this is done, everything 
should work just like if hbmk2 were launched from the 
cmdline.

Plus, it would be nice if HBIDE would allow setting an 
arbitrary list of envvars. By setting HB_WITH_QT and PATH 
properly, QT components would be found, without any extra 
tweaking like additional -L flag.

Maybe I will implement the latter in hbmk2 itself, by 
new cmdline options --eVAR=VALUE and --eVAR+VALUE.
Plus maybe a new input file .hbe which can be used 
like .hbc but is reserved for VAR=VALUE and VAR+VALUE 
pairs. I'd separate it from .hbc/.hbp because these 
settings are inherently environment specific (= 
dirs in local environment), so allowing them to 
be mixed in generic and portable files like .hbc/.hbp 
doesn't seem like a good idea. I have to give it 
some more thought.

   > hbmk2 hello.prg --ePATH+C:\mingw
   > hbmk2 hello.prg mingw.hbe
   > hbmk2 hello.prg mingw.hbe 3rd.hbe

where mingw.hbe is:
---
PATH+C:\mingw
---

and mingw_3rd.hbe is
---
HB_WITH_QT=C:\qt\4.5.3\include
---

Brgds,
Viktor

All the good.

You know I left Xbase++ years ago and hende have no
working code to apply hbXBP. You are the real user and your 
input will greatly lead to put hbXBP for production usage.

That will be even better.
I intend to migrate whole hbIDE on Xbase++ framework, and probably
will introduce many classes which are not present in Xbase++. Your
inputs will surely help in this direction.

This was the whole idea in hbide.env file which I thought of 
initially. I will rework on that concept. The idea is to forward all 
required info to hbMK2. A single.env will hold all the environment
settings user may have, compiler|platform specific.

As above.

WOW, so you are on target. 
hbIDE is heading to supply all info to hbMK2, and there you stand.
Let me concentrate on user interface and supply engine, you 
implement any such protos. I will forward whatever you would 
like to be forwarded.

Hi,

I get the following error in HBIDE, when I try to do a search (Ctrl-F), and
select "Entire file", then "Find", and this is the error:

I do not know if this was already reported, I hope your comments please.

I try to compile harbour on freemantle/maemo (never did before).
maemo is a linux distrib (debian derivative) for smartphone
supported by nokia. nokia promote qt on this platform.

QtGui/QSizeGrip is only one line : #include "qsizegrip.h"
and there is a file "qsizegrip.h" in /usr/include/qt4/QtGui

So, i think I am not qualified enough to solve this problem.

Thank you.

It's ok, I just wanted to say that for clean patch apply all the

But 2010-01-13 20:14 UTC+0100 adds a line in function
hb_hashGetCItemPtr() added in "2010-01-13 09:37".... or we add both or

I'm doing it quite manually to extract commits and hunks.

But you are a "core" developer, I'm just helping and I can't know if a
patch is really a bug fix or something else...

For example in one of your patches (about unicode overflow protection)
there were changes to win_prn3  (TEXT(0)) not listed in the Changelog
and I can't know if they are needed or not... in anay case, they don't
apply..

Yes, for example if you set a [TOMERGE 2.0] label for previous
commits, the comit message should be
Added [TOMERGE 2.0] to rev XY
and not "updated previous Changelog...."

In 2010-01-13 09:37, only one sub-change is marked as 
TOMERGE, the file harbour/contrib/hbclipsm/environ.c.

Yeah I know, it can get difficult, that's why 
we should use these marks.

Which commit was that?

Should be, but I can't promise that, since it 
takes a lot of time to do these lookups and keep 
it precise on every occasion. Anyway I may stop 
to mark changes as TOMERGE afterwards, I do this 
as convenience, but if it makes things worse, 
it's much easier to drop it. After all in other 
projects I just can see any notion os TOMERGE 
marks. Maybe there exist superior workflow for 
this.

Brgds,
Viktor

Only 2 hunks don't apply and they are the removal of cphr437 and
cpsl437, so this should be ok

      Read more in --help.

I am using Windows Vista and have GPF all times if I close the main 
window without closing the child windows.

A new version of the sample, using a static variable to control the 
windows opened. The main window only close if all child windows are closed.

[begincode]
#include "xbp.ch"
#include "appevent.ch"

Static nWindowsOpen := 0

PROCEDURE Main ()

    LOCAL oDlg
    LOCAL mp1
    LOCAL mp2
    LOCAL oXbp
    LOCAL nEvent
    LOCAL oMenuBar
    LOCAL oSubMenu

    oDlg := XbpDialog():new( , , {10,10}, {800,600}, , .f. )
    oDlg:title := "Test"
    oDlg:create()
    SetAppWindow( oDlg )

    oMenuBar := XbpMenuBar():new(oDlg)
    oMenuBar:create()

    oSubMenu := XbpMenu():new(oMenuBar)
    oSubMenu:create()
    oSubMenu:title := "Menu"
    oSubMenu:addItem( { "New window", 
{||hb_threadstart({||NewWindow()})} } )
    oMenuBar:addItem( { oSubMenu, NIL } )

    oDlg:Show()

    DO WHILE .t.

       nEvent := AppEvent( @mp1, @mp2, @oXbp )

       IF nEvent == xbeP_Close .AND. nWindowsOpen <> 0
          MsgBox( "Close child windows first", "Alert" )
       ENDIF

       IF nEvent == xbeP_Close .AND. nWindowsOpen == 0
          MsgBox( "Closing main window", "Alert" )
          EXIT
       ENDIF

       oXbp:handleEvent( nEvent, mp1, mp2 )

    ENDDO

    oDlg:destroy()

RETURN

STATIC FUNCTION NewWindow ()

    LOCAL oDlg
    LOCAL nEvent
    LOCAL mp1
    LOCAL mp2
    LOCAL oXbp

    oDlg := XbpDialog():new( , , {20,20}, {640,480}, , .f. )
    oDlg:title := "New window"
    oDlg:create()
    oDlg:Show()

    ++nWindowsOpen

    DO WHILE .t.
       nEvent := AppEvent( @mp1, @mp2, @oXbp )
       IF nEvent == xbeP_Close
          EXIT
       ENDIF
       oXbp:handleEvent( nEvent, mp1, mp2 )
    ENDDO

    oDlg:destroy()

    --nWindowsOpen

RETURN NIL
[endcode]

The windows are empty. Next step is to add things to the windows.

Thanks!

This is my first test with hbxbp, 2 or more windows and MT. The windows 
are empty. Now I am adding controls to the windows to see what happens.

I will keep you informed about the tests.

    + Reworked the way DEVMODE structure is handled. As many winapi
      interfacing methods, this is also a strange beast, it contains
      some hidden information, so it must be created using some
      winapi calls. I finally settled with these three functions
      to handle DEVMODE structure from .prg level:
         __WAPI_DEVMODE_NEW( <cPrinterName> ) => <pDEVMODE>
         __WAPI_DEVMODE_SET( <pDEVMODE>, <hashToWriteFrom> )
         __WAPI_DEVMODE_GET( <pDEVMODE>, <hashToReadInto> )
      Then <pDEVMODE> can be passed to WAPI_CREATEDC() and WAPI_RESETDC().
      Remember to recreate <pDEVMODE> after using __WAPI_DEVMODE_SET()
      and before using __WAPI_DEVMODE_GET() to refresh the structure
      content with actual device settings.

Ok, this is the first try
big-patch-2.0.0.diff should cleanly apply to branch 2.0.0
trunk-changelog should be applied to Trunk, it contains the TOMERGE ->
MERGED changes


So, to power-users and power-coders, please review and apply the
big-patches locally

If you also apply locally (DON'T commit) trunk-changelog you will see
some TOMERGE 2.0 still active.
One of them (2009-12-23 02:59) is actually present in the big-patch in
the form, but please double check should be done on the accented
chars.

Wonderful.

I will make tests today and come back to you later.
One more option may be needed: 

cCmd := [CALLl "%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"
x86]
cCmd += " PATH#c:\harbour_dev;%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio
9.0\VC\bin;%path%"

hbmk2 hello.hbp -cCmd

I mean, MSVC needs above call cmd to be invoked before setting the others.

Highly possible that I am missing something.

Pritpal Bedi

This cannot be done very cleanly. And I feel it somehow 
uncomfortable to add such feature to hbmk2, it makes its 
own launching mechanism fragile and error prone, and makes 
it possible to mess up lots of thing unintentionally by 
users (f.e. launch some apps, or make something interactive), 
which can make support for this tool quite difficult.
I also expect some potential problems regarding output 
redirection. Remember that such init command needs to 
called before _each_ external subprocess invocations, 
which may be done hundreds of times for some compilers 
and larger projects. Besides error prone, it's not very 
efficient.

[ BTW, note that "%ProgramFiles%" wouldn't work in -env: 
option, as hbmk2 would need shell emulators built-in to 
support it. ]

So I still think that it's not hbide or hbmk2's job to 
configure user C compiler environment, but if you absolutely 
want to implement it for hbide, you should detect shell type
(see sample code in config/global.mk), and create a temp 
script which calls such user init script first, then 
launches hbmk2. You will have to support posix shells (.sh), 
OS/2 shells (.cmd), NT/Win9x shells (.bat).

For .sh create this (LF delimited, with executable attr set):
---
#!/bin/sh
<call user commands>
<full hbmk2 cmdline, as launched now in hb_processrun() call>
---

For .cmd and .bat (just the temp file needs to have different extensions):
---
call <user commands>
<full hbmk2 cmdline, as launched now in hb_processrun() call>
---

Then you need to launch above scripts using shell processor.
This also varies from shell to shell. F.e. for NT/Win9x (and OS/2?) 
it's the well known '$(COMSPEC) /C <cmd>'. For *nix, the 
executable attr should be enough.

Brgds,
Viktor

OK.

I differ. It may not be hbMK2's job to configure as such,
and you are right, as it is essentially a command line tool,
but for hbIDE it is absolutely necessary. I do not want to
request user that please come out of hbIDE, reset your 
environment, and then reenter, just to compile a project
on different platform.

I think I need to dig deep into this issue.

So, in a way you have provided a clue how it can be done.
Though I am not well-versed with "make" internals, but for sure
I will give it a shot.

Surely not, but I doubt it is necessary in practice.

_Only MSVC_ (and ICC) requires a batch file to be called 
for configuration, and even this batch file will do nothing 
more than setting up a few envvars. So it's possible to 
reproduce it with pure -env: options.

The other option is to leave MSVC setup all the time, 
but this has the unfortunate disadvantage that it makes 
it difficult to support MSVC / MSVC64 / MSVCARM / MSVCIA64
multicompiler setups. (Idiocy of MS.)

Apart from this, we could also start to explore if 
there are any issues if we keep multiple compilers 
configured in parallel. This wasn't a supported scenario 
so far, but I see good chances that it can be made 
work for most, important to us cases.

I have some items on the hbmk2 TODO list, which could 
make this easier. One of them is autodetection developments, 
the other is to invoke commands with full pathspec 
to rely less on PATH envvar and avoid potential clashing 
names. This way we could handle scenarios like two MINGW 
compilers (with different version).

But even without these features, it may already be possible 
to start testing such scenarios with hbmk2.

And remember that with '-env:' option everything can be 
made work, even MSVC with the trick described above.

Technically it can (most probably) be done. But on hbmk2 
level this creates much more problem then it solves.

This has nothing to do with make internals. You simply 
call some shell commands before invoking hbmk2 and let it 
do its job just as now.

Viktor

Hi Francesco,

It came through, thank you.

Here are my results:
1) I had to 'unix2dos *.diff' to make it work on Windows.
2) I had to move my freshly checked out branch 2.0 dir 
   (named 'harbour-2.0' by default) to b/harbour/ dir to 
   make it work.
   (it would be nice if the patch would just apply by 
   starting it from root, or one level up, recognizing 
   'harbour-2.0' dir.)
3) There is one problem in patched ChangeLog @ line 90, 
   where an embedded .dif file content appeared. This 
   has to be fixed. (this was the only one of this kind)
4) I got some error on patching. This first kind is most 
   probably the result of 'unixtodos'. And this means 
   whoever applies this patch should use *nix OS, like you do.

It looks safe to copy the current latest (r13473) src/common/hbtrace.c 
from trunk. I didn't verify it though with an actual build
(should be before 2.0.1 release).

Hi,

I posted this question on the users- mailling list, with no replies.
Perhaps it's a bit more developer suited.  Hopefully I am not intruding by
posting this here.

   1.

   Why can't I compile my Hello World program on my Windows 7 x64 OS?

   options of what to install and no hint as to which one you need. But with my
   brother's help, he picked out likely the one to use, and it didn't make any
   difference on this issue. Nor did reinstalling Harbour 2.0.0 with every
   option installed in the Wizard. *sad face**


PS:  If anyone knows the answer / solution, I will keep track of it on my
Harbour blog:  http://209.97.219.2/sjohnson .  If anyone cares to look
through it and answer some of the other questions, I'd be happy to put them
in there too.

If someone wants to go the extra mile and participate with me through email
and answer all the questions or any simple ones I come up with in hopes to
improve the documentation as quick as possible, I'd be very excited and
motivated to do so.

Thank you for reading.

It seems you opted to not install the embedded MinGW compiler, 
which means it uses the one you have installed in PATH, and this 
one isn't compatible with this Harbour build.

Can you tell us which MinGW version is this?

Nor did reinstalling Harbour 2.0.0 with every option installed in the Wizard. *sad face*

MinGW64 is required only if want to create x64 binaries.
Instruction are vague because no one has time to update 
the link every week, plus lately there is both x64 and 
x86 native binaries as option (both can be used with 
Harbour). MinGW64 is still is development phase and 
hopefully they'll make it more obvious what to download 
to use it.

Unimplemented CL5.3 LIGHTLIB setting. We intentionally return NIL to
indicate the fact that LIGHTLIB is not part of Harbour.
---

Actually Harbour is returning 0 while Clipper NIL, 
so maybe we'd need to fix this in Harbour.

I reinstalled Harbour and selected every checkbox during the install
process, so I don't think I purposely chose to leave anything out.  I also
never have installed MinGW prior to trying Harbour on that machine...  But I
will probably take a trip down to work tomorrow (where the machine is) and
post what I can, since I will be near there anyway.  I appreciate the
response!

hi smu johnson
I am intrested to grow your harbour blog
I received same mail so gemeralize same typical question
i can share same google document collected is samebody help me revise


Why a lib is named libhbxbp.a instead hbxbp.lib?
Becase is the standard of mingw compiler used
harbour in hbmk allow use hbxbp.lib and automatically understand name of library

How  can i use hbmk2 for script like clipper and rtlink?
http://docs.google.com/View?id=dhmtv9fs_231ds785wf9
How find a. ng harbor updated?
for now Documentation in is not jet present but you can find the ascii
version in  \harbour\doc directory
You can learn harbour from sample
read clipper documentation as basis at http://www.ousob.com/ng/53guide/
the explore habour\tests directory and tests directory contained in
any  contrib area
a sample will be good than 10000 word


What is ontrol source header parsing (in incremental build mode) <m>
can be: native, full, partial (default), off ?
How replace sixdriver?
i want know a list of functions in c + + examples for use in harbor
How find in wich are missing lib can that cause  undefine external ?
How resolve Duplicate definition wich library are coinvolte
I have cre created a gui application but how trasform?
 how to get the processor serial number

other info

In this case I have no idea ATM, I unzipped the .7z 
release (should be the same as installing with every 
checkbox checked), typed the same thing (with -trace 
and I left hello.prg in its original location), and 
got this (on Win7 x64 EN):

Please post your 'set > log.txt' results, maybe we can 
spot why hbmk2 chooses an external GCC compiler on your 
system.

2. In "bkmk2", what does the two mean? Was there an "hbmk" before?

Yes, in fact it's still around, called 'hbmk', and it's the 
initial bash script version created by Przemek, which supports 
GCC family compilers, and core options only.

hbmk2 was created to support all shells, all compilers on 
all platforms, also to replace old 'bld.bat' solution, while 
staying compatible with existing hbmk script features and 
options. Now it offers lots of new features, like incremental 
mode, static and dynamic library generation modes, .hbp/.hbm/.hbc 
input files, option filtering, built-in macros, C compiler 
environment autodetection and autoconfiguration, integration 
with VCS systems, built-in complete .po handling, Windows 
resource files, C++ support, implib generation, timestamp 
header generation, multiproject invocation, multilanguage UI, 
.clp support, rtlink/exospace/blinker/clipper emulation support, 
Harbour 1.x and xhb support, conversion of xmate/hbmake/xbuild 
make files to native hbmk2 format, optimization and warning 
control, binary compression, embedded Harbour compiler. And 
a lot more on the deeper level.

Brgds,
Viktor

	Change win_BMP to allow printing compressed formats JPEGs, PNGs.
Message-ID: <4B5C3ED8.4040208@gmail.com>

Hi,

I've extended the class win_BMP to allow printing compressed formats JPEG and PNG if the driver allows it with a good result. 
Today many printers support these formats and not is the same, in network environments, send to printer 6MB in DIB plane that 
90KB in JPEG.

The code is 100% compatible with existing. Load supports JPEG and PNG files in addition to BMP and check the driver for 
printing. Any existing application by simply changing the file can exploit this advantage, of course, if your printer driver allows.

If you want I can commit it in SVN.

Hi Xavi,

That's great, I've actually started to fiddle with this exact 
same area in these moments.

Pls commit.

Hi Pritpal

I appreciate very much your efforts.

I tried to make a static and put the butoon on it but it didn't work.
So I guess some other parts in the hierachy is stealing the key.

Works fine !

See attached appLogin.prg  ( sustitute the one you have on your pc )

It works but has an odd behavior as you'll see in example.
Enter event doesn't get removed so it continues tabbing to the end.

I tried to subclass xbpSLE into xbpGET to test local changes and I 
discoverd something:  setdata() and getdata() doesn't work due 
xbpdataref is using fixed class names instead of IsDerivedFrom() function.

I also noticed a new object is created every time you call AppDeskTop(). 
Isn't it resource consuming ? Maybe an static var could be better.

keyboard() method of xbpdialog is not working, I can capture esc, enter 
and Fx keys ( F1,F2,etc )

I'm not sure but I suspect PosAppEvent isn't working either.

I some days I will post much better expample-test .prgs

Thank you =)

Angel

Hi Viktor,

Ok, this afternoon I finish to tune some things and I do it.

One more thing:

I was lurking xbpDialog source and was wondering why you chose

       ::oWidget := QMainWindow()

instead of

       ::oWidget := QDialog()

Just curious

Currently changing default theme only applies to new files opened
or the next run is executed. If you want to apply theme to current opened
tab, then right-click on the tab and select "Apply Theme". On my TODO list
there are many artifacts planned for themes. Right now I am concentrating 
on how hbIDE can be used for building projects.

Because QDialog() does not provide for Menu's, Toolbars, StatusBar,
and central widget which is the :drawingArea of XbpDialog().
XbpDialog() in its strict sense is not a _DIALOG_ with dialog behavior,
it is essentially a _WINDOW_ with window behavior.

Alaska did not distinguish a pure dialog and XbpDialog(), 
    and
hence this is the reason of so many nights I spent on resolving
this concept only. There is a distinct behavior of dialogs and windows.
If your login dialog would been a pure dialog, then "Return" on default 
push button would have succeeded but here it fails because parent is a 
window, not dialog.

Infact Aalska's concept of drawingArea is also crappy, because, as its base
levels it does not confirm to Qt's Central Widget concept. I have reported 
earlier also that much of the Xbase++ class framework, with names and 
method calling convention are derived from Qt or some similar
implementation.

May be I could not have explained well...

No, it wont work there either. To accept _ENTER_ for a push button,
parent needs to be a QDialog() only.

Can you amend hbXBP source to show exactly how this can be 
achieved? Or can you explain a little more in detail so that Przemek 
can look into this aspect. I am not much familiar with all OO constructs.
Probably it will be a matter of some small change in the sources.

No, it is a static object returned everytime you call.
How did you observer it is returning a new object every-time?

No, PostAppEvent() is not working. I tried but it is not possible

Make it a show-case application, 100% Xbase++, and add functionality
inside. This way I will always be in a position to adopt your changes 
and make tests. It is highly likely that I will post this application on SVN
in hbxbp/tests. Put on notes whereever possible, I see you have done it
and is self descriptive.

Thank you for your positive interest.

You have been allways very clear on your concepts =)
But I'm a pragmatic man so I don't think we have to stick with all AS 
design choices so...
I propose you to create a new class: xbpForm() or xbpGetDialog() based 
on QDialog() to make upon all our get screens easier and compatible with 
qtDesigner's .ui form loading.

What do you think ?

Angel

This way you are supporting extensions to Xbase++ language.
XbpHbDialog() or XbpQDialog() seems to be the right name and will base
itself on 
QDialog() instead of QMainWindow(). It will also have a :drawigArea
which will point to itself to facilitate not to rewrite the already tested
code.

So you are supporting Xbase class extension ?
Groups opinion ?

Yes. I tested it. See in my other post the new class proposal.

See in AppLogin.prg line: 19 to 22

// prevent undesirable maximizing effects
aSize := oDlg:currentsize()          <---- gets current dialog size
oDlg:maxsize := {aSize[1],aSize[2]}  <---- don't allow to make it bigger
oDlg:minsize := {aSize[1],aSize[2]}  <---- nor smaller

See and run new AppLogin.prg
First SLE's enter gives focus to second and second to the puchbutton
Should have stopped in second SLE

I will try but if I can't send events in response it has no sense.

Hi Xavi,

Thank you very much.

It works with .jpeg and also .png.

I began testing with the same .png I used for all 
my previous .pdf tests, it's a 10 years old file, and 
it made the test Harbour app crash. Another such 
.png is pngtest.png from libpng package. This will 
not crash the app, but something nasty happens in 
the background because no printer output is created.
I've been testing on Win7 with MS XPS Document Writer,
win_CheckPrnDrvFormat() returns .T. All in all it 
seems MS .png support isn't terribly robust, even 
on Win7.

Do you know a way to determine .jpeg and .png 
image dimensions? It would be nice to have it working 
in win_bitmapdimensions().

Brgds,
Viktor

Anything it takes to ease bussines programs programming.
I'm not a fundamentalist. I am using xbase++ till now cause it was the 
most serious option available in 1999 when I migrated 16 bit clipper 
console apps to 32bits GUI ones.
I'd like to design entry screens with qt designer and load-execute them 
on my app.
Sometimes data driven screen area needed and sometimes custom made ones.
I know many xbase++ programmers and I'm sure they endorse my oppinions.
I've been trying to make them post in this list but they are shy and 
only lurk here.

As I said, I'm out and ingernet connection is worse than expected....
at least today.... don't know next days.

Yes, I worked on linux and transformed the repository in a mercurial
repos... I will check the problems you report asap.

I still think we should mark them as extensions.
Be it special name, or #if guards. So far special 
names seem to have been used. In this case it 
could be xbpHBForm.

If we don't mark where xbase++ compatible parts 
end and where extensions start, we will pretty 
quickly start to inevitably _alter_ existing 
functionality and this may eventually break even 
backward compatibility, so if this is what we want 
(I strongly don't), we should rename HBXBP to HBQTGUI1 
or something similar to not give wrong expectations 
with the name, or even more it outside the repository 
where no such basic rules exist and no promises are 
made.

Brgds,
Viktor

I agree with angel's idea
and add a little dream add element created by qt designer to hbide, or
better integrate qtdesigner in hbide

we can explaing where xbase++ compatible parts end and where
extensions start with a dirretent naming in  class
so instead XBP wil be hbp or  XXBP or XBP2 or HQT or XQTor  XBQ

How about pure Hbp*.

HbpDialog()
HbpForm()
HbpLayout()
HbpGraphicsDialog()
HbpGraphs()
...

It is intuitive and communicates well to the world that
it is an extension in Harbour. Off course these classes will 
respect complete naming convensions of Xbase++.

You only dream OR actually observe what is happening around ?

Did you ever tried to look into hbIDE's code ?
Did you tried to follow what is going on in hbXBP ? and hbIDE ?

Stop _dreaming_. Look into hbIDE sources and you will see that almost 
all dialogs, even main window with docking widgets, are created with 
Qt Creator and reimplemented through XbpUILoader() class.

I plan to extend XbpUiLoader() class to return an object of type Xbp*.

You are correct in your observation. Me too took to Xbase++ around
this period, but could never launch converted appln because of many
bugs at that time. In 2002, when I discovered xHarbour, I knew this 
is what I need and never looked back again.

It is already there. Look into XbpUiLoader.prg. Also check in hbIDE, its 
implementation details. I would like to hear how exactly this class should 
behave. Try something...

Me too expect more posts from Xbase++ users but ... may be in near future...
who knows. It is again my request to them to speak out on this list.
It is going to be in xbase community's benefit all the way. Be rest assured
that I have developed a passion for hbQT, hbXBP, gtqtc, and hbIDE and 
will try my level best that it is realized in masses.

Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP95DF7D1F0AAD2BF23585ABEF5F0@phx.gbl>

My Ubuntu PC has been flakey lately.

I booted it up after maybe two months and I only got a grey screen after 
the system started.

So I reinstalled everything, it worked, it confirmed to upgrade to 9.10 
and I accepted.

Now it does not boot at all.  Well it boots but then ABEND's.

I saw a message about video flash by, so I searched the Web for info on 
my monitor got a suggestion about adding "i915.modeset=0" to the kernel 
line of the boot up process and within the grub menu list file.

When I rebooted the video message was replaced by one about waiting for 
a device.  I thought it did not like the mount point I made to the WinXP 
PC so I managed to get into a command line and restore the original 
version - thank god for a backup file!

But the reboot gave the same thing, waiting for a device.  I only see 
this message if I interrupt the boot process and get into the 'recovery' 
mode boot up and let it run single lines (I think that is what I did).

I found an Ubuntu blog which described my exact issue but the page did 
not help.
(https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mountall/+bug/483205)

Are there any suggestions from the group?

Downlad a Cdrom from Ubuntu with the last version 9.10 and install it

try to download alternate CD version ( is a text mode version , with more
options at the moment of install )

Do you have separated    /   ( root ) and /home partitions ?

If you have , only format / ( root) partition to save your home data

in this way you can have an operating linu box quiqly and without lost any
of your data

I was going to respond before I see your changes that "we need to use JPEG's and PNG's structs" but...
That's great!. I need to assimilate, it's sophisticated but look good. :)
Thank you.

I just got the .png size checking ready, but no wonder, 
it requires libpng. We have it so it's not a problem, 
but it will create a new dependency so I'm thinking how 
to minimize the effect.

Brgds,
Viktor

    + Added libpng dependency for hbwin lib. libpng requires

Subject: [Harbour] INIT/EXIT Procedures - Thread Wise
Message-ID: <27302415.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello Przemek

1. Do we have something like thread scoped INIT/EXIT 
procedures. In hbXBP some functions have to be called
only once and that too before any other code is executed.

This will facilitate the better performance. Otherwise I 
ever have to check the existance if some variable if 
it is initialized or not.

2. Do we have some provison in Class framework to get 
the chain of inheritance. This is required for Xbase++ object 
method :isDerivedFrom( cClassOrObject ). 

I need to establish if a particular class belongs to the same
family somewhere ancestral. And based on this some actions 
are executed. Right now I am doing like this ( but it is only one 
side of the coin ):


METHOD XbpWindow:isDerivedFrom( cClassORoObject )
   LOCAL lTrue := .f.
   LOCAL cCls := __ObjGetClsName( Self )

   /* Compares without Xbp or Wvg prefixes  */

   IF hb_isChar( cClassORoObject )
      IF upper( substr( cClassORoObject,4 ) ) == upper( substr( cCls,4 ) )
         lTrue := .t.
      ENDIF

   ELSEIF hb_isObject( cClassORoObject )
      IF upper( substr( cClassORoObject:className,4 ) ) == upper( substr(
cCls,4 ) )
         lTrue := .t.
      ENDIF
   ENDIF

   IF !( lTrue )
      IF hb_isObject( ::oParent )
         lTrue := ::oParent:isDerivedFrom( cClassORoObject )
      ENDIF
   ENDIF

   RETURN lTrue

As you can make out, above code is valid only for those 
instnces who have oParent only. This is not real implementation.
Your help is requested.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

      generate any project on any compiler from within 
      single instance of hbIDE without leaving it.

      Here are the implementation details:

         Right-click on <Projects> node in "Projects" tree and select <Environments...>.
         The selected environment will become the default for current session and will 
         be saved for next invocation until it is changed. Next build will respect 
         this setting.

      EFFECTIVENESS
      =============
         Create a desktop icon pointing to hbIDE.exe and place the only parameter 
         poing to "hbide.env" file. You can copy it anywhere in your project tree,
         amend it to suit your requirements, and just execute hbIDE on your desktop.
         NOTE: you _MUST NOT_ set any compiler specific variables before invoking
         hbIDE. Your working slate must be clean.

      WHAT_IS_NOT_DONE
      ================
         The bash commands and their shell invocation. But I know a lot of you 
         will implement that in no time.

Don't forget the "make" like automatic feature of detecting when header files 
are newer than the source file that includes them in -inc mode. I mentally thank 
you, Przemek and Maurilio for this contribution almost every day!

Viktor,

I am ecstatic that you helped me, and correctly guessed what was happening!
I was ready to swear I didn't have gcc.exe on my computer, but as it turns
out, I did.  It comes bundled with Strawberry Perl, a win32 Perl
environment, and sets it up for the %PATH% variable.  Well I'll be!
Actually, to find out what was happening prior to running C:\>path, I ran
locate32 (freeware windows filesearch harddrive indexer) and found the
problem right away.

Again, many thanks for giving me a hint.  I will add this to the FAQ page on
my end, as hey!  It could happen to anyone.

Thank you for your kind words.

That's true, I forgot about it (and probably more), so:

'.prg and .c header file dependency autodetection' also 
comes as new feature.

Everything what I've committed should be merged in 2.0 because
it's very hard to take such modifications separately.
Probably only core developers who well knows Harbour internals
can apply patches separately but even in such case it's very
big risk of making some mistakes.

best regards,
Przemek

That would IMO be much more difficult to do than 
applying the selected patches only, since the 
selected ones are usually well separated, while 
the patches in general are no so much so. Take 
the hbwin patches for an example, or any patches 
which were done after type changes.

Plus such is doubtful, because you say all your 
patches should go (after marking some of the for 
merge), while I say only my marked ones should go, 
and while this system already looks unsystematic 
(f.e. what about the other developers?), it's 
the perfect way to confuse anyone who's trying 
to do the job.

This could be avoided by simply copying current 
trunk to 2.0.x and say we were developing 2.0.1 
all along. I don't agree with that though, because 
that wasn't how f.e. I started to make changes, 
which means there may be things which are not 
necessarily stable, were not necessarily tested 
on all targets, and may break compatibility 
promises.

Even some of your changes may break it, f.e. 
adding WIN32PRN to xhb. (it's a good change, 
but nevertheless not a 2.0.1 one), or 
'renamed DB_DBFLOCK_XHB64 => DB_DBFLOCK_HB64', 
or WinCE function cleanup.

So to make merging task easier, maybe it'd 
be useful if you marked the remaining ones 
you think should go, as TOMERGE. A quick 
review revealed that there are some which 
may indeed qualify as bugfix but not marked 
as such. Of course we can let it to Francesco's 
best judgment.

Brgds,
Viktor

I do not agree. I think that everything should be committed.
Maybe I'm wrong but I expect very serious troubles with HB_SIZE
and similar type modifications so I would like to give stable
Harbour version for users with all current features which I also
plan to use in my production environment.
If you want then I can try to merge all modifications except new
types to 2.0 branch.

Przemek

Sorry for reopening a very old and OT thread, but my needs are quite the same
as Viktor's one and i think something changed after 2005.

I ported successfully a large clipper 5.2e application, working on many
networks, to Harbour 2.0.
Now, before to swap the installation to Harbour version, i would to test the
effectiveness of the job using one or few Harbour workstation concurrently
with old Clipper ones on the same network.

Thus, i changed the Clipper app to use the DBFCDX driver and compiled
Harbour using the same driver and setting the locking scheme to CLIP (not
CLIP53). The adopted code is:

   REQUEST DBFCDX
   RDDSetDefault("DBFCDX")
   RddInfo( RDDI_LOCKSCHEME, DB_DBFLOCK_CLIP )

   REQUEST HB_LANG_IT
   REQUEST HB_CODEPAGE_IT850
   hb_cdpSelect('IT850')
   hb_LangSelect('IT')

Apart of a dirty Clipper problem about the compound indexes (i posted
yesterday a message on the google clipper group) solved using the INDEX
command in place of the OrdCondSet()/OrdCreate() pair, the program crashes
only in one function, giving a "lock required" error after a successfully
lock of the same record. The strange thing is that the flow is apparently
the same of other parts of the application working fine.

Thus, i'm thinking that i gone wrong in some configuration option or i'm
ignoring some bug of the adopted implementation.
Ther'is any hint about the DBFCDX driver coexistence? Ther'is another better
path to try (not SQL based, as i need to mantain DBF approach before
quitting old Clipper world).
TIA.
Maurizio

I'm sure you can do it and do it right, but IMO 
our project would scale much better if such 
things could be done by new contributors, and 
Francesco gave it a pretty nice go. Plus I still 
don't feel confident to release all _my_ patches 
to 2.0.1, some were not tested thoroughly (hbwin, 
hbmk2), or cannot be yet considered as the ultimate 
final solution which I'd like to make any compatibility 
guarantees (hbwin), and I'm not thinking about 
HB_SIZE/HB_BOOL (which I still have to understand 
why worries you that much).

BTW, just to repeat also for myself: the notion of 
minor (?.?.x) releases is to provide fixes-only and 
no new features (unless absolutely required, 
tested, and finalized), plus it should be binary 
compatible with ?.?.0.

Anyway, I'd suggest to discuss this between you and
Francesco, for me anything is good which is inline 
with basic ?.?.x release rules and produces a stable 
Harbour 2.0.1.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi pritpal and hbide community follow is my observation about the good
hbide that will transform harbour in Rock solid , visual development
environment for business application

Now in windows when executed hbmk2 from hbide it not show a separate
process  (very good! i strong like)

Follow is feature that i like in future release
- generating ppo using Spit Horizontally .... and sync row
- Having in  hbide support project embedding explained by Maurizio La Cecilia
  Maj be done Instead "set as current" defining a sequence of project
to compile  . set as current 1,2,3
- Having in ihbide something like xmate Option Keyboard . A keyboard
mapping to a script language
- Having  debug in  hbxhb based version, because after see source code
and set breakpoint    is useful use same environment to display
source in debug mode
- Having Find in file feature because is very important search in
project or directory. i daily use this option in xmate

follow is my little guide to hbide prerelease
http://docs.google.com/View?id=dhmtv9fs_235db6hz754
for now is still a bad and copyless works but i hope that with
observation will be more good

I remember fixing it, also after a 9.10 upgrade, by removing the
"search ..." statement (or something like this) from the grub config
on bootup and in the menu.lst.

Message-ID: <6E0B8757-E4B6-4E87-A64E-B52C295E4E97@syenar.hu>

Hi All,

It's been one month since we released Harbour 2.0.0, 
and since then, the sf.net stats are even better than 
before.

As for the overall sf.net rank, Harbour Project was 
most of the days in the 135-175 range. This is 
pretty good considering that this is a sophisticated 
development software for expert audience only and 
sf.net hosts hundreds of thousands of project. [ I'm 
sure it can still be even better though. ]
   http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/rank_history.php?group_id=681&ugn=harbour-project

Among 'compiler' projects, this rank translated to 
_5th_ position, which is simply great:
   http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?stquery=&sort=group_ranking&sortdir=asc&offset=0&form_cat=48

Among 'database' projects, this translated to 7-9th 
overall sf.net rank, also very nice.
   http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?stquery=&sort=group_ranking&sortdir=asc&offset=0&form_cat=66

We exceeded 90000 total downloads a few days ago.

There has been a total of 3145 downloads for 2.0.0 
in one month, and this is very good, especially 
if we consider that by 2.0.x we offer the unified 
package for majority Windows users, which contains 
10 platforms/compilers, amongst them MS-DOS, OS/2 
and Linux targets. So all those separate downloads 
in 1.0.x release are now blended into one download 
with 2.0.x. This is no so good for our stats, but 
it's good for users :)

Please keep downloading and recommending the project 
on these links:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/harbour-project/
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/harbour-project/files/

Brgds,
Viktor

Massimo it is posible in anyway compile a prg in Hbide
without createing a project ?

Just for test some code ?

and , its posible when I need to edit some file
that HBide can open directly a prg file  like another editors ?

I know that HBIDE it's much more than a simple editor but
I like the source editor of hbide , but I need to open HBIDE
an then open the file , when with others I can use contextual button
to decide wich editor use.

Do you understand ? may be my english is not so good to explain my question

Thanks
Bruno

This is the hbmk2 way
Hbide have visual editing,debug,run cycle


>

This is right idea i suggest Pripal implement a sigle file edit
compile run without  creating a project
but for now in command line is planed a hbide,env file
inestead a sigle prg editing will be good

in your mind you wand use hbide like notepad++
start project
open a single file
compile if is a sample test or file in
You request is like a editor mode alternative to project mode
Imo a lot of user thik in this way

Be Proud! All of you!

Hi Bruno

How about this idea ...
hbIde source code is open, so it would be possible to strip out the text 
editor with sintax higlighter and make a single source editor that 
accepts file name in commnad line.

Maybe hbSE (harbour source editor) ??

Anyway good exercise to begin with hbxbp programming ;)

Regards
Angel

It's the result of an intelligent team with a lot of perseverance and a 
precise goal.This project is driven by real programmers needs, not by 
any marketing department, and there are millions other guys like us in 
the world.

Xbase as a languaje deserves an honored place in the IT world just like 
Python and many other dynamic languajes.

Congratulations to the team !!

IMO is better If possible implement as part of hbide  also for giving
to hbide a more big audiences. and not confuse harbour user with
different executable for ide and editor.
Imo is sufficent filename in command line and atual env in "/env:hbide.env"

Introducing THREAD INIT PROCEDURES is very bad idea.
Let's imagine that such feature is used in many different places
by core, contrib and 3-rd party libraries. In such case even trivial
few function thread will activate absolutely unnecessary initialization
code which will consume much more time then the whole thread and this
cost will have to pay all Harbour users even if they do not plan to use
features which needs such initialization. It's enough that such code
will be linked with final application.
Anyhow we can think about adding dynamically initialized thread static
variables were initialization code is executed when variable is accesed
1-st time, i.e.:
   thread static s_var init <{code}>
<{code}> is evaluated when thread access s_var the 1-st time and its
result is assigned to s_var. Such implementation does not cause any
overhead in code which never access s_var.

The functionality like THREAD EXIT PROCEDURE can be done quite easy.
Just simply store object with destructor in THREAD STATIC variable
when your thread starts.

   __clsParent( <nClassHandle>, <cClassName> ) -> <lDerived>

i.e.:

   ? __clsParent( obj:classH, "MYCLS" )

We have also commented code for :isDerivedFrom() method in src/vm/classes.c
which we can enable if we decide it's usable as general OOP functionality
like :CLASSNAME or :CLASSH

Subject: [Harbour] hbIDE some ideas, suggestions & questions...
Message-ID: <531d7a751001250733s5b3cda46tb5837b84818696c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all!

After reviewing the suggestion of Massimo on the option to create a new project,
I thought better about hbIDE and came to these ideas and some
questions what I want to expose to the group:

1) I need to set the project properties which the name of the main PRG
contains the function main ()? If the answer is YES, we need to put it
easily as the first array of sources? This would be the idea of the
menu PROJECT SELECT MAIN MODULE - be a quick shortcut to this feature
- but it is still necessary?

2) The option PROJECT> ADD TO SOURCE PROJECT or PROJECT> REMOVE FROM
SOURCE PROJECT would be two options to speed up common tasks of
manipulating the sources modules in a project.

3) In the project properties there could be an option for me to put
there favorite icon for my application (where appropriate).

4) I need to inform the root location of my HB installation path,
because I would like to use hbIDE (done in Qt), but I compile with my
HB + BCC or HB + MSVC or HB + MGW... The option "Path to hbMK2.exe" in
properties would be for this?


5) In the properties of hbIDE should be have an option to specify the
'default location' where hbmk2 is found. So if we open a file PRG
without a project open, we could click with it and build hbIDE could
compile and link the file in use ... And until we could add a button
similar to  "Build only this source" in the options menu.

6) When I click on "new project" option, I believe that we could ask
very little information to streamline and simplify this step.
Additionally we could put some 'templates' which could be mounted
(using HRBs) to assist also with a field to enter the path of hbmk2
... I build a screenshot how it could be look like this:

http://www.kssoftware.com.br/new-project.png

If you need to change something in the project, I can do this later,
but the basics to build something that would be.

7) I need to have an option to personalize the flags for compiler and
linker in "Debug" or "Release" modes. in the toolbar and I need a
practical way to  choose what target I would like to generate the
application. So I could have # defines specific project to my way of
"Debug" would not want to use in "Release" and this could be of great
help. (Like MSVC)

http://www.kssoftware.com.br/select-target-type.png

8) In the DEBUG option eventually I need to change some environment
variables what I do not want to use the OS shell to do this. (Like RAD
Studio)

http://www.kssoftware.com.br/debug-enviroment.png

9) In the project properties would need a field to set the target
platform and may be useful to make cross-build process.

10) Support BUILD-EVENTS that when the hbIDE for start and end the
process build it call some specific user-commands (such as calling the
upx, send the generated file via FTP or run any other program like
compression or encryption, etc.)

http://www.kssoftware.com.br/build-events.png

11) How we can generate an HRB from an source in current project?

Remembering that I am not xMate user but these suggestions as I'm
mentioning my experience with other development tools. I think these
are interesting features, what do you think?

I'm sure it is not. But as I would like to separate these commands in
a separate source, this was my first idea. If only validate the
routine name calling instead of the name + source is already seen as
something safe, we can simplify the process of validation.

Yes, you don't need to supply your Harbour root dir 
at all, as HBIDE uses hbmk2 as its build engine, and 
hbmk2 is able to handle all the little details of that. 
Based on its own location it will autodetect every required 
components of Harbour. Of course if you need to use 
something non-standard you can use existing hbmk2 
facilities to override any of the environment details 
using envvars (HB_*_INSTALL). I wouldn't recommend to 
do this though.

So the only required setting to make hbmk2 work is 
the location of hbmk2 executable. On all platforms.

[ BTW it can even be in PATH. But we must supply 
options for those who don't wish to add it to PATH. ]

I added HBIDE_DIR_HBMK2 envvar for this purpose, I didn't 
recheck after latest changes, but hopefully it still works, 
if not I think it should be fixed. And even better would 
be to propagate this option to the GUI somewhere as 
global option with per-project override.

This needs alteration of 'workdir' in hbmk2, which 
can be done using -workdir= option and adding a 
'${hbide_build_type}' macro component to the dir, 
and add -env:hbide_build_type=<debug|release> option 
to set it.

Target platform is just an hbmk2 switch: -plat=

In HBIDE it was recently implemented as separate option with 
{hb_plat}, which uses HB_PLATFORM envvar. I don't know the 
reasons, this seems like overcomplicating this matter and 
HB_PLATFORM envvar is definitely a legacy solution, so using 
-plat= option directly seems to be the optimal solution here.

> 11) How we can generate an HRB from an source in current project?

As for the hbmk2 part, see contrib/hbnetio/utils/modules.hbp 
for option for this case.

I don't know, to me it looks like a very light 
protection. I feel that _any_ hbnetiosrv setups 
with unlimited RPC enabled is inherently unsafe 
with or without such tricks. After all the protected 
function is just one more public function calling 
other public functions, which are available anyway.
If harm can be done, it can be done regardless of 
protection. For example client could call __QUIT() 
function anytime to shutdown the server. It's 
pretty difficult to create an executable to sort 
out all potentially harmful public function which 
gets linked via various dependency paths.

What do you think?

Brgds,
Viktor

IF prg have a main a standard option must be emulated
No operation will be neccessary for compile most harbour\tests\
other that open and run

I missed that one. Well, hbmk2 _does_ copying to any filesystem 
target after successful build (-instpath= option), it also supports 
upx for compression (-compr option), which leaves FTP/SCP and 
friends, and to address that shortly: I wouldn't like to convert 
hbmk2 into a 'curl' clone, it simple hasn't got any point to 
duplicate existing functionality in an inferior fashion.

BTW, you missed installer creation which is also a feature missing 
from hbmk2, and it will probably be missing forever due to 
the many variations and due to the fact that building installers 
is rarely tied 1 to 1 to building binaries, so some 'postbuild' 
script seems to fit the task better. For sure newer IDEs offer 
such feature, but I don't know how usable it is at this stage.

There is also .app bundle creation on OS X, which hbmk2 tries 
to do now, but it's pretty much experimental yet.

Overall there can be any number and sort of prebuild/postbuild 
tasks that users may want to automate, but as a general rule 
I'd like to keep hbmk2 as the builder tool only. Though if 
there is some generic and portable task that seems to be better 
suited for hbmk2, we can still add it there.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Viktor!

Looking from this perspective it may be unnecessary that kind of protection.

And while we're on this subject: one idea I have studied is the
comparison of hbnetiosrv with other servers such as MySQL and
PostgreSQL and I think we could have a full server and a command line
client with all the options we have done so far. How could we do, for
example, if we need to remotely monitor the status of a server
hbnetiosrv? If we have a thin client could connect and do exactly what
we need to inform only the data from remote connection ... what do you
think?

You just missed "Environments" concept altogether.

You are absolutely right.
_DO NOT_ split hbIDE.
It was easy and I could have done it if it were to add productivity.

I will add this feature today.

I speak of this to generate from within the hbIDE without having to

You are totally wrong Angel.
If this would been the goal, it would been realized the day-7.
But hold-on, you may find all the features in hbIDE itself, who knows.

I know, all I wanted is to point to existing hbmk2 configuration 
which does exactly that and which can be implemented in HBIDE.

BTW, the easiest would be if HBIDE would open .hbp files as projects...

Current double system of HBIDE projects and hbmk2 projects 
seems like a large duplication of effort.

And also note that even hbide options could be stored right 
in .hbp files as specially formed '#' (commented) lines. Which 
means it wouldn't bother hbmk2, but it could be recognized by 
HBIDE.

This way you could rebuild a project from both command line, 
and edit it in HBIDE. For this would be a crucial feature 
to ever use such IDE.

Brgds,
Viktor

Ok, I understand that Viktor ... but I speak not to change the hbmk2
to insert it these resources, because hbmk2 did not need this. I speak
from hbIDE give me a field for me to customize these actions on my
project. So I can work on my CPU in "Debug Mode" and when  I finished,
I compile in "Release mode" and her call my batch file that compress
my app with custom software (not UPX) and send it via FTP or do other
things that I consider important.

Hi Pritpal

Maybe my english is confussing but I was not suggesting to split hbide.
I was encourging Bruno to make the tools he needs himself as a practice 
on hbxbp programming. This is the advantage of open source projects.
We have source and we can make our own tools if we need to.

Angel

1) on server write status to a text file every n seconds.
2) on client memoread that file and.. voila !

Clear to me.

I wrote these to draw the line where hbmk2 ends and HBIDE starts.
In some cases it may not be obvious first. We should implement 
everything in its best place and avoid implementing the same 
thing in both projects, as a general rule.

Brgds,
Viktor

Thanks for clarification!
Hbide is full prg code so Modifying it will be a good internal experiment
i have a created a hbide2 local directory with my simple modification

Hi Angel!

Using RPC does not need it. But I think the server does not need to
have many commands... I think we should make a client that has the
most complete command line and we can connect remotely via IP on a
server. For the way it is today, I need standing in front of the
computer where hbnetiosrv is running to get any information (ok, I
could use VNC, logmein, etc.) because what we have is good, however we
needs the an client more robust and efficient.

Yes, it's a good idea. We need to deal with 
security though. On one hand there are server-level 
information (and tasks) we don't necessarily want 
to share with all clients. And there is server-side 
information which is not confidential, yet it can 
be exploited by hostile client.

All this means that we need some sort of 
authentication and multiple security levels on the 
server, and have each command associated with one 
of these levels. And this is even true for the server 
console, which can simply be regarded as a local, 
embedded client, which means there is no need to 
create separate code for local and remote admin 
consoles.

Brgds,
Viktor

Yes, it's a good idea.
In this suggestion is good think also to all harbour server service like
hbnetiosrv.prg  trm_srv.prg and the upcoming gtnet or httpsrv.prg


IMO will be good also Having a Unificate server service :
hbsrv:=hbnetiosrv.prg + trm_srv.prg + httpsrv.prg+gtnet when ready
with a ini for define what task activate
will help spread harbour over ip having a Unique application_dabatase
server application ready to run in bin

This is my 2 cent

Hi Viktor!

I think the main gain is the ease of maintenance we perform on remote
servers. This certainly will make a big difference, because even with
the use of passwords our server is already somewhat protected from
access of others.

I'm not sure I understand; if the server is password 
protected but you can get a remote console to it from 
any client machine with equal rights as if you were 
standing in front of the server machine, what gives the 
protection?

One other way to add protection is to offer admin remote 
access on a different port, and this port can have limited 
access from certain IPs, etc. This way you can SSH into 
a server console and control the server process via commands 
or a console tool. Well, instead of limited access 2nd 
port, even the security levels could be determined based 
on what IP connected to it, but that seems less flexible 
and more exploitable.

I can think of an analogy with f.e. a Cisco IOS/PIX router, 
where the whole box is just running, serving connections, 
and you can connect to a separate port as admin, authenticate 
with your admin pw, change security level (like "sudo") with 
additional pw, and run commands which control and query the 
whole box's operation.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Viktor!

An remote client connects (command line app or not) on hbnetiosrv he
needs must know the IP, port and password on our server. I say that
already exists at this point a certain level of security (even though
very little) in this respect.

Now I understand your point of view and you're right. But I believe we
dont have to worry about this right now.

Yes, as you say very little. These things are not that 
much of a problem if the server is running inside a LAN 
protected from the outside (typical for hbnetiosrv), but 
for any server that gets opened to the internet, it's 
highly unsafe. Remember that now we have only _one_ password 
which protects the only one data connection that exist, 
and using the same password for data connection and admin 
connection is already a big security problem, even for 
a local network with many users. It can be solved, 
but it needs effort.

If we will be lucky to have GTNET in the future, 
at least I'll have to deal with these (at least if 
I need the comfort of built-in remote control). Since 
GTNET will happily run via slow internet connections, 
too.

BTW, we will also need to deal with this if we want 
to convert (= run) either hbnetiosrv or hbgtsrv to/as 
a daemon or Windows service. This is the only way 
to control such "headless" setups.

Brgds,
Viktor

:isDerivedFrom() must be in the core as it is Xbase++ implementation.
I would prefer to call it directly instead of __clsParent( obj:classH,
"MYCLS" ).
Looking forward that it is enabled by default.

Thank you for the insight.

Subject: [Harbour] hbIDE - Requested/Thought-of Features Tracking
Message-ID: <27313368.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hi Everybody

To not forget what we need to implement in hbIDE
( getting older day-by-day ) I am compiling all such messages
pertaing to the betterment and usefulness of hbIDE for the masses.

Please reply to this thread if you need any feature is missing or
need reworking to _THIS THREAD_ only. It is easier for me to
look at one place only to base my strategy upon. Scattered threads
make is nearly impossible to track them down with the passage
of time, and hence, has the tendency to be lost forever.

I will feel highly oblidged if you follow the above rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------


1) I need to set the project properties which the name of the main PRG
contains the function main ()? If the answer is YES, we need to put it
easily as the first array of sources? This would be the idea of the
menu PROJECT SELECT MAIN MODULE - be a quick shortcut to this feature
- but it is still necessary?

2) The option PROJECT> ADD TO SOURCE PROJECT or PROJECT> REMOVE FROM
SOURCE PROJECT would be two options to speed up common tasks of
manipulating the sources modules in a project.

3) In the project properties there could be an option for me to put
there favorite icon for my application (where appropriate).

4) I need to inform the root location of my HB installation path,
because I would like to use hbIDE (done in Qt), but I compile with my
HB + BCC or HB + MSVC or HB + MGW... The option "Path to hbMK2.exe" in
properties would be for this?

   Yes, you don't need to supply your Harbour root dir
   at all, as HBIDE uses hbmk2 as its build engine, and
   hbmk2 is able to handle all the little details of that.
   Based on its own location it will autodetect every required
   components of Harbour. Of course if you need to use
   something non-standard you can use existing hbmk2
   facilities to override any of the environment details
   using envvars (HB_*_INSTALL). I wouldn't recommend to
   do this though.

   So the only required setting to make hbmk2 work is
   the location of hbmk2 executable. On all platforms.

   [ BTW it can even be in PATH. But we must supply
   options for those who don't wish to add it to PATH. ]


5) In the properties of hbIDE should be have an option to specify the
'default location' where hbmk2 is found. So if we open a file PRG
without a project open, we could click with it and build hbIDE could
compile and link the file in use ... And until we could add a button
similar to  "Build only this source" in the options menu.

   I added HBIDE_DIR_HBMK2 envvar for this purpose, I didn't
   recheck after latest changes, but hopefully it still works,
   if not I think it should be fixed. And even better would
   be to propagate this option to the GUI somewhere as
   global option with per-project override.

6) When I click on "new project" option, I believe that we could ask
very little information to streamline and simplify this step.
Additionally we could put some 'templates' which could be mounted
(using HRBs) to assist also with a field to enter the path of hbmk2
... I build a screenshot how it could be look like this:

http://www.kssoftware.com.br/new-project.png

If you need to change something in the project, I can do this later,
but the basics to build something that would be.

7) I need to have an option to personalize the flags for compiler and
linker in "Debug" or "Release" modes. in the toolbar and I need a
practical way to  choose what target I would like to generate the
application. So I could have # defines specific project to my way of
"Debug" would not want to use in "Release" and this could be of great
help. (Like MSVC)
http://www.kssoftware.com.br/select-target-type.png

   This needs alteration of 'workdir' in hbmk2, which
   can be done using -workdir= option and adding a
   '${hbide_build_type}' macro component to the dir,
   and add -env:hbide_build_type=<debug|release> option
   to set it.

8) In the DEBUG option eventually I need to change some environment
variables what I do not want to use the OS shell to do this. (Like RAD
Studio)
http://www.kssoftware.com.br/debug-enviroment.png

   I hope that Will be made also a (xhb) visual debugger for made easy
   all the works

9) In the project properties would need a field to set the target
platform and may be useful to make cross-build process.

   Target platform is just an hbmk2 switch: -plat=

   In HBIDE it was recently implemented as separate option with
   {hb_plat}, which uses HB_PLATFORM envvar. I don't know the
   reasons, this seems like overcomplicating this matter and
   HB_PLATFORM envvar is definitely a legacy solution, so using
   -plat= option directly seems to be the optimal solution here.

10) Support BUILD-EVENTS that when the hbIDE for start and end the
process build it call some specific user-commands (such as calling the
upx, send the generated file via FTP or run any other program like
compression or encryption, etc.)
http://www.kssoftware.com.br/build-events.png

   This is very usefull but imo must be integrated in hbmk2 so will be
   executed also via comamnd line

      I missed that one. Well, hbmk2 _does_ copying to any filesystem
      target after successful build (-instpath= option), it also supports
      upx for compression (-compr option), which leaves FTP/SCP and
      friends, and to address that shortly: I wouldn't like to convert
      hbmk2 into a 'curl' clone, it simple hasn't got any point to
      duplicate existing functionality in an inferior fashion.

      BTW, you missed installer creation which is also a feature missing
      from hbmk2, and it will probably be missing forever due to
      the many variations and due to the fact that building installers
      is rarely tied 1 to 1 to building binaries, so some 'postbuild'
      script seems to fit the task better. For sure newer IDEs offer
      such feature, but I don't know how usable it is at this stage.

      There is also .app bundle creation on OS X, which hbmk2 tries
      to do now, but it's pretty much experimental yet.

      Overall there can be any number and sort of prebuild/postbuild
      tasks that users may want to automate, but as a general rule
      I'd like to keep hbmk2 as the builder tool only. Though if
      there is some generic and portable task that seems to be better
      suited for hbmk2, we can still add it there.

         Ok, I understand that Viktor ... but I speak not to change the
hbmk2
         to insert it these resources, because hbmk2 did not need this. I
speak
         from hbIDE give me a field for me to customize these actions on my
         project. So I can work on my CPU in "Debug Mode" and when  I
finished,
         I compile in "Release mode" and her call my batch file that
compress
         my app with custom software (not UPX) and send it via FTP or do
other
         things that I consider important.

            Clear to me.

            I wrote these to draw the line where hbmk2 ends and HBIDE
starts.
            In some cases it may not be obvious first. We should implement
            everything in its best place and avoid implementing the same
            thing in both projects, as a general rule.

11) How we can generate an HRB from an source in current project?

   As for the hbmk2 part, see contrib/hbnetio/utils/modules.hbp
   for option for this case.

      I speak of this to generate from within the hbIDE without having to
      open a shell or run a batch file ... it has this option from within.

         I know, all I wanted is to point to existing hbmk2 configuration
         which does exactly that and which can be implemented in HBIDE.

         BTW, the easiest would be if HBIDE would open .hbp files as
projects...

         Current double system of HBIDE projects and hbmk2 projects
         seems like a large duplication of effort.

         And also note that even hbide options could be stored right
         in .hbp files as specially formed '#' (commented) lines. Which
         means it wouldn't bother hbmk2, but it could be recognized by
         HBIDE.

         This way you could rebuild a project from both command line,
         and edit it in HBIDE. For this would be a crucial feature
         to ever use such IDE.


------------------------------------------------------------------
12)
- generating ppo using Spit Horizontally .... and sync row 
- Having in  hbide support project embedding explained by Maurizio La
Cecilia 
  Maj be done Instead "set as current" defining a sequence of project 
  to compile  . set as current 1,2,3
- Having in ihbide something like xmate Option Keyboard . A keyboard 
  mapping to a script language
- Having debug in hbxhb based version, because after see source code
  and set breakpoint is useful use same environment to display
  source in debug mode
- Having Find in file feature because is very important search in
  project or directory. i daily use this option in xmate

-------------------------------------------------------------------
13)
A) A feature of xMate that i think needs to be absolutely present in hbIDE
is the project embedding. I can, i.e., define a production project
enumerating the own files AND adding to xbp also the linked subprojects
(also xbp, of course) as the engine library project, the gui library
project, and so on. This declaration allows to build in cascade the
subprojects and the main project if some change was made in any source, not
important if of main or sub projects. Also, the open file allows to work in
the same instance of xMate editing any source of main or sub projects.

The target is to have a generated hbp file capable to rebuild not only the
source of the main project, but also the linked library declared as
subproject, including i.e. hbc files as subprojects.
Maybe a directive to declare that the lib isn't only to be linked, but also
to be edited and, if needed, rebuilded could do the job. hbIde could
recognize this parameter and could allow to open also the subproject sources
in the editor and after, at build time, assure that the lib declared as
subprojects are parsed by hbmk2 BEFORE the build of the main project. This
is what xMate smartly does.
If you are parallely developing a production/test program and a subset of
libraries on that you're working hard, the benefits of this approach is
unvaluable in terms of clarity, speed and safety. Try to make the same job
with other project managers, also very effective as xDevStudio, and you'll
return quickly to xMate...

---------------------------------------------------------------------

it is posible in anyway compile a prg in Hbide
without createing a project ?
Just for test some code ?

   This is the hbmk2 way
   Hbide have visual editing,debug,run cycle

and , its posible when I need to edit some file
that HBide can open directly a prg file  like another editors ?

   This is right idea i suggest Pripal implement a sigle file edit
   compile run without  creating a project
   but for now in command line is planed a hbide,env file
   inestead a sigle prg editing will be good

I know that HBIDE it's much more than a simple editor but
I like the source editor of hbide , but I need to open HBIDE
an then open the file , when with others I can use contextual button
to decide wich editor use.

   in your mind you wand use hbide like notepad++
   start project
   open a single file
   compile if is a sample test or file in
   You request is like a editor mode alternative to project mode
   Imo a lot of user thik in this way

---------------------------------------------------------------------

My idea is to give any hbIDE request a number reply to 
__THIS THREAD_ but with new topic heading containing first 
words as 

hbIDE[ 14 ] Any feature you want 

and in message body explain it. One reply per request.
And remember to reply to _THIS THREAD_ whenever a new number 
is assigned.

Above compilation assigns 13 numbers, next starts at 14.
Again I request to follow this methodology.

This is always possible when you define your source tree.
Just put main source file at the top of the list. No need to 
redefine. Does it make sense ?

This is an absolutely necessary feature but place holder 
should not be <Main Menu>. It will be implemented in popup 
menu under right-click on project'e title node in "Projects" tree.

Are you saying that when project is built as an "Executable"
then the icon defined as such be embedded into ? 
OR 
I am missing something ?

If such is the case, you can include a .rc file in your project
which defines it and is respected by the application. See Angel's
sent project.

Have you experimented a little with the "Environments" concept
recently introduced ? This addresses the above issue. Infact,
I am never comfortable to start hbIDE from some already 
configured environment. Just play with it and let me know 
if it works as intended or not OR some more work is required.

Viktor, I have introduced the placeholder in "Properties" dialog
under "Environments" tab which holds this variable by default 
if one is assigned, or, you can override if you want another one.
But then I ran into troubles when I used hbMK2 from this path.
I do not know what went wrong, so I included 
   {content} set PATH=_to_my_harbour_bin;%PATH%
and everything went fine. May be we need to tune it further.

This could be a good feature. We need to be a little more 
causciou, however. "Simplify" means simplify already existing 
protocol. If it confirms to this rule, yes.

Please continue with this feature. I am concentrating on something 
else. If possible club it in new prg which could be sub-class of 
IdeProjManager() or could be called as a function. In ideprojmanger.prg,
I am making heavy changes in near future until build proocess is 
clearly marked "OK".

Of course. But in GUI I have the option in xDevStudio create a new
project and then later we can add several PRGs to it (I have a project
with almost 200)! When appropriate I can click on the list of project
files with the right button and select any file as "main" and with
that gain agility in the process - because I do not need to locate a
source into a huge list, since in the treeview as I can find it later
and click it.

I have inserted this in xDevStudio the request of some users and I
think now something simple, but efficient.

It would be something good coming! Imagine:

* I click FILE> OPEN and select a file any PRG.
* It is not part of my current project then I click on PROJECT> ADD FILE
* Done. It is enough to build the project again and everything is
already configured.

Now the option to remove can be displayed by clicking on a file or if
there is no selection a dialog should ask me which of the files
currently in use in my project I want to delete, like this:

This is easy. We need to decide its placeholder. 
It should be combobox in toolbar or a part of "Project Properties"
dialog ? Or somewhere else ?

Probably this can be achieved in new 
"Environments" protocol where an environment definition
can be split loke this:

      [ BCC55 5.5.1 Command Line Tools ]
{hb_comp} bcc
{shell} cmd.exe
{ext} bat
{content} set HB_COMPILER=bcc
{content} set PATH=c:\harbour;c:\harbour\bcc\bin;C:\harbour\harbour\bcc\bin;
<DEBUG>
{content} set MyVariable1=someValue1
{content} set MyVariable2=someValue2
</DEBUG>

Off cource this can be substituted easily through a wizard,
but I want to keep things simple and straight.

Please note that "Environments" protocol is designed for this 
purpose only. I do not know how does hbMK2 works, I simply 
accepting input from user and pushing forward to hbMK2.
May be this is not needed at all, and probably does not, tell me
what else I have to remove from hbide.env to make it crystal
clear. These are my grasp of the knowledge only which can be 
limited.

-plat=option will be the final result of 
{hb_pat} win  == -plat=win
This is only a way to record this entry in "Environments".

I think the right would be a tab in project properties to inform the
flags. And a combo in the toolbar to provide an method to select
current compilation mode.

This is useful but can be separated from build process.
After each successfull build some visual option somewhere 
on the IDE should appear to carry the extended tasks.
OR
we can extend "Environments" like
   {install} _path_to_the_installation_folder 
   {upx} level5
   {ftp} http://myftp.ftp [ with all usual attributes }

Then {install} and {ups} can be translated to hbMK2 syntax
and forwarded in the .hbp. Because FTP is a different beast,
and does not ( and should not ) form a part of hbMK2, be kept
as separate process invoked via hbIDE. We can even think of 
scheduling the FTP uploads.

project.hbi and project.hbp are two different entities.
It is difficult to post hbIDE specific commands in .hbp.
.hbp is a non-visual creation and .hbi is a visual one.
.hbi will supply all needed info to .hbp, and this had been 
the goal since begining. I strongly over-rule this idea.

Just like .ppo is generated, .hrb can be initiated, no issues.

Hi!

I vote to make this process as simple as possible. The trip had been a
field for setarmos the command or commands to be executed via __RUN ()
is enough.

Well, I already have my own FTP client (via command line) and I do not
think hbIDE have to worry about this offer now and if she can run the
command line everything will be perfect for me.

You are right, it's not needed in most cases. It's only needed 
if you want to override autodetection, or if you want to create 
cross platform-builds.

I intentionally left out this parameter from most examples, 
to encourage users to drop it. So, IMO at least in default 
.env file, it should only be there if required.

Anyhow I'd suggest to create a simple setting, say {hbmk2} 
which could hold any number of standard hbmk2 options, in 
the form of:
{hbmk2} -plat=win -comp=bcc -env:<something> <...>

In the future there will be even more options to fine tune 
per environment options (and even now there is, f.e. 
-arch (for CPU) and -build), and it's much easier to offer 
a generic solution which accepts known hbmk2 options, than 
implementing a unique solution for each of them.

BTW, I'd also suggest to use one common syntax in all 
HBIDE related config files. In .env I see '     [ SECTION ]' 
for section header and {<item>}<space><value> for items. 
In .hbi files I see '[ SECTION ]' and <item>=<value>.
While standard .ini files use: '[Section]' and <item>=<value>.

But again, IMO .hbi files should be much better as simple 
.hbp files, with '#HBIDE' formatted commands for extra HBIDE 
specific information.

I also don't understand [COMMON] section. The default state 
should be what's already setup in the environment when 
starting HBIDE. IMO it's unnecessary to replicate another 
level of default HBIDE.

Finally I don't understand {shell} and {ext}. Why should 
these be specified by users on a per configuration bases?

HBIDE should be able to detect shell, and configure 
everything automatically. No need to add an extra layer 
of abstraction on that IMO.

Brgds,
Viktor

It should not be difficult.
As I have never used a debugger, can someone points me 
to what necessarily I have to study to implement this feature?

An idea that has now emerged: Maybe we should add the item "Harbor
Portable Format" to the list of formats that already has
"Executables", "Libraries" and "DLL" ... In order to get something
more generic may need to replace the term "DLL" to "Shared Libraries"
or enable it only on Windows Systems.

With this option we can join our PRGs that need to be compiled as HRBs
in one or more projects in a practical way. What do you think?

Absolutely necessary.
I have this on my TODO list and probably will be implemented this week.
However some implementation steps will be different.

Please don't add duplicate syntaxes for hbmk2 options 
if possible, it's enough to add one per config "{hbmk2}" 
line to gather all hbmk2 options, and that's it.

There is enough things to learn about Harbour already, 
and it'd be beneficial for everyone not to learn and remember 
(and develop) the same things twice in different ways.

Looks like my message can't really go through and it's 
quite sad to see. Maybe I can't express it in English 
properly.

No problems.

Ok, I got it.
We need a placeholder in "Properties Dialog".
Will do shortly.

It's a huge issue. Since it ties the whole project to 
HBIDE, which means the project cannot be built without 
HBIDE. Some ppl prefer command line tools for some tasks 
and for some automated tasks this is actually a basic 
requirement, since there is no other way to do it than 
invoke hbmk2 directly.

Plus if both "visual" and non-visual information would 
be in the same interchangeable file, it would be 
_very_ elegant to just supply a .hbp for every project 
(many of them already have one) and simply use that 
with HBIDE _as is_. No need to reconfigure everything, 
no need to ever _sync_ anything, and users can simply 
switch between GUI env and cmdline env without worrying 
about any additional problems.

This is real flexibility and such a solution would 
make HBIDE more superior in this regard to even MSVS.

I think we should seriously consider this, and think 
about the best way to combine the file types. I can 
even create a hbmk2 option parser call which can be used 
by hbide as is.

F.e. we can use option prefix to denote HBIDE specific 
information: --hbide:cat.option=value, or use 
comments: #hbide:cat.option=value

Brgds,
Viktor

Not as a tab in "Properties" but as a new field in <General> for 
<Debug Compiler Flags>. Build time flag can be picked from toolbar.

Hi Viktor, all,

pretty cool, congratulations!

You guys may want to update Harbour's entry on freshmeat, on the FSF
software list etc. If I remember correctly, it's still announced as
version 0.44 there...

Cheers,
Martin

{hbmk2} -plat=whatever -env:<something> <...>
{hbmk2} -comp=bcc
{hbmk2}

So now hbIDE have to deal with these components:
{hbmk2}      To be place in .hbp
{shell}         To be invoked
{ext}           To have {contents} file this extension
{contents}   To be placed in shell specific file.

You have simplified my task. Thank you.

Oh yes, I am reading the posts from 1-up so it came late.
I have already agreed to {hbMK2} section. It simplifies a 
lots of actions.

Now I am realizing the full power of hbMK2.
Thank you for this great tool.

Thank you, I've found it. If I'm not mistaken this 
is per project setting, is HBIDE_DIR_HBMK2 envvar still 
available to set this option globally for all projects?
A global GUI setting could also be fine.

Nice to see you Martin.

Thanks for the note, I hope some will volunteer to update these.
It would certainly be useful for the project.

I am convinced.

So we can have one more file type as only file 
file for the project - .hbp. 

This way we can reuse existing .hbp.
However we must consider how to include / remove 
sources in .hbp. I have an idea how to achieve it, and 
will implement this concept in toto.

No, this is global setting, but still I have not invoked it.
See, ideprojmanager.prg [1181-1186 ]

If we want to avoid full and hbmk2 compatible 
.hbp parser in HBIDE, one solution is to use 
section markers:

--- .hbp
-hbdyn
-inc
-...
-o

#HBIDE.FILES_START
test.prg
#HBIDE.FILES_END
---

You can add similar sections for every .hbp parts 
which are allowed to be controlled also by GUI means.

If you stick with above method, you can use this 
method to store HBIDE-only settings inside .hbp file:

#HBIDE.category.option1=valuex
#HBIDE.category.option2=valuey

Brgds,
Viktor

Besides actively participating on Harbour dev 
list in the early times, Martin developed the first 
significant chunks of Harbour's hbct lib. He also 
contributed to complete and finalize math handling 
subsystem in hbrtl (most of math.c). Most of his 
contributions are still there and working fine.

Viktor

To include hbIDE specific stuff in .hbp is easier.
But the   reverse is tough from current .hbp format.
It would been heartening if .hbp would been sectionized.

Let us parse hbide.hbp

#
# $Id: hbide.hbp 13533 2010-01-11 13:44:04Z druzus $
#

../hbxbp/hbxbp.hbc
-inc
-w3 -es2 -gc3
-ohbide

# Trick to make QT 4.6 link using default Harbour build
-ldflag={msvc}-nodefaultlib:msvcrt.lib
-ldflag={msvc}-defaultlib:libcmt.lib

hbide.prg
ideobject.prg
idestylesheets.prg
idetags.prg
idemisc.prg
ideactions.prg
ideeditor.prg
idefindreplace.prg
idedocks.prg
idesaveload.prg
iderequests.prg
idethemes.prg
ideprojmanager.prg
idesources.prg

ideparseexpr.c


What I can recognize:
Lines starting with    #   comments
                            ..    hbc location
                             -    switch 
Lines having            =    switch 

Everything else              source file

Am I right in my observation ?
If yes, then I have an idea how to hook 
pure .hbp into hbIDE.

Pritpal Bedi

Hi Itamar,

Either use hbwin.hbc to link in hbwin module. Or add 
libpng lib to the liblist manually. (first option strong 
preferred, to avoid any similar problems in the future)

Also see:
   contrib\hbwin\hbwin.hbc

Thanks!
but name libpng.lib is redundant, best change name for hbpng.lib is IMO.

You're welcome. Please consider dropping {shell} and {ext}.

Here is sample code. This won't consider such exotic 
case as running hbide from msys (or similar) shell, but 
that seems a slightly pervert thing to do anyway, so:

---
#include "fileio.ch"

FUNCTION RunShell( aCmd )
LOCAL cShellCmd
LOCAL cExt
LOCAL cPrefix
LOCAL fhnd
LOCAL cCmdFileName
LOCAL cCmdFile
LOCAL tmp

#if   defined( __PLATFORM__WINDOWS )
   cShellCmd := hb_getenv( "COMSPEC" ) + " /C "

Bruno, I already lost my 9.3 Ubuntu because of its failure to boot, 
leading me to reinstall it and then upgrade to 9.10; I do not know how 
to make /home on a different partition, I'll look that up later.  I will 
download a 9.10 CD image this week.

Marco, I was looking on the bug sub-page for LaunchPad, I'll look at the 
answers page tonight.

Phil, I've examined my /boot/grub/menu.lst, there is no 'search...' 
line; I am not sure what you mean about the grub config

Thank you for your help.

April

It's an external project hosted in Harbour repository. IOW 
it's not a Harbour library, and the authors of that external 
project gave it the name 'libpng', which we're just using as is.

Removing 'lib' will cause various additional problems to 
deal with depending on platform and compiler, so current name 
is best option.

April , Download the Alternate CD Install not the usual

http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/downloadmirrors#alternate

This allow to you more options

When you define partitions and mounts , create a root partition and mount /
on this
then create another partition and mount /home on it , finally create a swap
Partition with double size of your memory in PC

Now you can install , and  in the next install you keep safe your  data  in
/home , please take care to do not format
this partition when you have data in it.

The idea is exactly that it should not be sectionized, 
but just a free flow of tokens, this ensures these files 
can be embedded for example, and make parsing easy as a 
stream. Nevertheless, with above method, you can add 
quasi-sections for HBIDE, and human users to understand 
and respect, and hbmk2 just ignores.

Yes, that's always guaranteed to be true.

These are not necessarily line based, you 
can have any number of tokens (options, input 
files) in one line. Tokens with '.hbc' extension 
are just one kind of input file.

Tokens starting with '-' (and in some 
cases '/') are always options, the rest is 
input file. Types of input files are recognized 
by extension and/or '@' prefix.

[ nit pick: some input files are specced 
as options, f.e. -l<lib> ]

> Everything else              source file

_input file_ rather. Some input files are source 
files (based on extension), some others are hbmk2 
config files, or other misc input files, like 
.clp, .d or .po files.

> Am I right in my observation ?

Partially. It's a freeform format. I hope above 
comments helped to clear it. If not, pls ask.

Brgds,
Viktor

Still I do not know how to cover for *nix.
Hopefully Vailton will do it.

"FreeForm" format.
And here the trouble begins.
It is possible that you reach to .hbp from .hbi
but is not possible to transfer .hbp to .hbi.
Probably even we do not need it. I simply can
give ext .hbp to .hbi and can contain .hbi 
specific sections as you described. It is easy.
It stands valid for new projects. For already 
.hbp's these have to be re-created through 
hbIDE. If this is acceptable, I can move 
in this direction. Such created .hbp will be 
valid for hbMK2 and hbIDE both.

Thank you.

Please change to 'cShellCmd := hb_getenv( "SHELL" ) + " "' 
for __PLATFORM__UNIX and it should work.

I didn't think of this limitation. Let me think 
about it for a little while, maybe it's possible 
to create a simple parser, which can be used in 
HBIDE to read pure .hbp files.

If we do it this way, it's enough to use the 
#HBIDE.section1.var=value trick to include 
HBIDE specific options/tokens.

BTW, hbmk2 also has a -skip option which can 
be used to abort .hbp file processing. Something 
what may be useful. I used it already to embed 
.hbp file inside a .prg.

I think you missed the ' ' (space) after 
hb_getenv( "SHELL" ) and the actual file.

cC   := iif( hbide_getOS() == "nix", "", "/C " )

No, not needed. 
I am not issueing hb_processRun() but Qt's
process management and the parameters are 
handled differently under QStringList.

I forgotten to say that the same piece of code works fine in Clipper
5.2e+DBFNTX and in Harbour+DBFCDX.
Maybe the opportunistic lock take a rule in that?
TIA.

Hi Martin
are you welcome

You have also good Xbase++ experiences
Can you help us in refiniing hbxbp/hbide?
Xbase+ Part compatible and more
http://docs.google.com/View?id=dhmtv9fs_240zntnvdc7
hbide is  visual version of harbour based  on hbxbp

Can i request what do using [x]harbour for?

CL52 DBFCDX/SIX3 SIXCDX drivers are broken and can corrupt index files.
so I cannot give you any guaranties that it will work. Anyhow if
you want to use it and access the same index files by Harbour then
you should use in Harbour SIXCDX RDD which tries to replicate some
low level SIXCDX behavior. It creates less efficient indexes in some
cases but it's a workaround for some CL52/SIXCDX bugs.
CL53 DBFCDX/COMIX seems to be much better choice for Clipper.
Additionally you have to chose _EXACTLY_ the same locking schemes in
both compilers.
CL52 DBFCDX/SIXCDX uses FP locking. CL53 DBFCDX/COMIX use CL53 locking
but it can be changed to FP locking if you link with your application
cdxlock.obj

>    REQUEST DBFCDX

None of Clipper CDX drivers uses such locking scheme so it's wrong.

>    hb_LangSelect('IT')

If you are using HB_CODEPAGE_IT850 in Harbour then you have to link your
Clipper application with ntxita.obj. Otherwise index files will be corrupted
because Clipper and Harbour will use different collation orders.

Harbour and CL53 DBFCDX/COMIX do not support none compound IDX indexes
so I guess you are using CL52 DBFCDX or SIXCDX driver.

In Clipper and Harbour 1022 "Lock required" RT error is logical error.
It means that programmer didn't successfully locked the record. The
physical record lock is not checked when this error is generated.
It means that it's a problem with application code. Check why it's
exploited when you compile it using Harbour. It's possible that setting
valid locks scheme will hide the problem but for sure it will not fix
the code. Such error should not appear in code which always checks
results of RLOCK/FLOCK operations and never tries to write to not locked
record so it's something what you should try to locate and fix in your code.

See above. You have to use exactly the same locking scheme and national
sorting order inb both applications. If you are using CL52 DBFCDX or SIXCDX
then use in Harbour SIXCDX too. If you are using CL53 DBFCDX or COMIX them
use in Harbour DBFCDX.
CL52 DBFCDX and SIXCDX have serious bugs and for me should never be used
in production environment. Anyhow it's possible that your code does not
exploit them very often so you can live with it.

HTH,

It's not such trivial. It's necessary to modify compiler, generated
PCODE and HVM. It will be also good to ask group if such syntax
extension is acceptable:
   thread static s_var init { || hb_datetime() }
or maybe we should add to sth.ch:

   #command thread static <!var!> init <initcode> => ;
            thread static <var> initblock <{initcode}>

and then to compiler support for:

   thread static <var> initblock <block>

so programmer can simply make:

   thread static s_var init hb_datetime()

There is much more "default" methods in different OOP implementations
in xbase world. I do not think that it's good idea to adding separately
some of them because some of us wants to use it in some project without
bigger vission about final code.
I do not know which system methods use xbase++ and which of them are part
of object and which ones belongs to class object only.

Thank you.

For me the problem with TOFIX and TOFIX2, is that 
I have no idea what names are used for dynlibs in xhb.
If you can tell me about it, I can apply the fixes.

Also, what is the equivalent of hbmainwin in xhb?

Viktor

This issue essentially resolvs around _performance_.
So if the PP method described as above places no overhead
then that's it! But if it checked everytime the variable is 
accessed then there are other ways also to simulate it.

I am delighted to hear this. 
Will implement in hbXBP code shortly.

I understand this concern. 
Because I have a solution as above, I do not need it by default anymore.

Thanks for clarifications.

Subject: [Harbour] qt slots/events
Message-ID: <E9EE56FA-7329-42DC-8EC5-6BF0556854FE@syenar.hu>

Hi Pritpal,

I see this code in hbxbp:
---
METHOD HbpQtUI:destroy()
   LOCAL a_

   FOR EACH a_ IN ::aSignals
      Qt_Slots_disConnect( ::pSlots, a_[ 1 ], a_[ 2 ] )
   NEXT

   FOR EACH a_ IN ::aEvents
      Qt_Events_disConnect( ::pEvents, a_[ 1 ], a_[ 2 ] )
   NEXT

   ...

   RETURN NIL

METHOD HbpQtUI:event( cWidget, nEvent, bBlock )

   IF hb_hHasKey( ::qObj, cWidget )
      IF Qt_Events_Connect( ::pEvents, ::qObj[ cWidget ], nEvent, bBlock )
         aadd( ::aEvents, { ::qObj[ cWidget ], nEvent } )
      ENDIF
   ENDIF

   RETURN Self
---

Which is redundant, because we're keeping track 
of events/slots in both ::pSlots/::pEvents, and 
also maintaining a .prg level copy of the list in 
::aSlots/::aEvents. It's also prone to leak/GPF, as 
it's up to .prg level code to make sure all slots/events 
are disconnected.

By using GC facility, would it be possible to rework 
hbqt low-levels, to allow for this code, solving both 
problems:
---
METHOD HbpQtUI:destroy()
   LOCAL a_

   ::pSlots := NIL
   ::pEvents := NIL

   ...

   RETURN NIL

METHOD HbpQtUI:event( cWidget, nEvent, bBlock )

   IF cWidget $ ::qObj
      Qt_Events_Connect( ::pEvents, ::qObj[ cWidget ], nEvent, bBlock )
   ENDIF

   RETURN Self
---

What do you think?

Brgds,
Viktor

Thank you very much.
I've just look closer at current xHarbour CVS and it will not be easy
to make sth with it.
In current xHarbour CVS code MinGW build uses 'xharbour[mt]-1.2.1'
and in the earlier versions it was without version number 'xharbour[mt]'.
But non GNU make windows builds create 'harbour.dll' !!! instead of
'xharbour.dll'. Looks that first xHarbour developers should clean it
and we should not touch it now.

> Also, what is the equivalent of hbmainwin in xhb?

xHarbour does not have such library at all. It only has 'mainstd' in
MinGW builds.
Current xHarbour versions seems to have also some additional libraries
for dynmaic code but I do not know what is their exact job. They try to
overload some of HVM public symbols and such operation is illegal for
most of linkers so I guess it's a hack only for some chosen windows
compilers. I cannot say more without investing more time in checking
the xHarbour code and I have serious doubts that it's possible to find
xHarbour developer who can explain what exactly this feature should do
and can clean it to work with all linkers so I think we should not touch
it too.

BTW I have also some questions about filters in hbmk2 script files.
Does -help output describe all condition variables?
Is it possible to use or add conditional switch like {shared} in .hbc files?
How exactly the conditions are processed? Can they be located anywhere in
the line and when evaluate to false they disable whole line?
What will happen if I use more then one condition in single line,
i.e. -o{win}win{bcc}bcc ?

Maybe it's be possible to create .hbc file which will allow to use
different xHarbour versions without touch hbmk2 code.

Subject: [Harbour] hbide hbp parser
Message-ID: <480C8C7F-874F-4C61-9595-B373BF8A30C5@syenar.hu>

Hi Pritpal,

Pls find attached .hbp parser for hbide. 

The in-memory structure internally keeps track of 
empty and misc comment lines, plus exact line / file 
location of original .hbp lines/options, which may 
help to try to keep original layout when writing out 
edited version of the file. Anyhow this is optional, 
and pretty much the cherry on top.

[ The parser don't support recursion into .clp, 
embedded .hbp and .hbm files. It can be added, 
but in this case it's much difficult to update 
the files, and I'm not sure it's useful enough 
or very often used feature to justify. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

I think this should be modified to use REQUEST mechanism, i.e.
   REQUEST HB_PNG
Now everyone who use WIN_PRN class has to link his code
with PNG library even if it's unnecessary.

In *nixes thius library is called 'png' so it's necessary to use

Subject: [Harbour] Re: Harbour 2.0.0 binaries for OS/2-eCS
Message-ID: <4B5EE8C0.5090009@mail.udg.mx>

Third report

Harbour 2.0.0 binaries files for OS/2-eComStation are available since 26
Dec 2009, exactly one month ago
Harbour 2.0.0 contrib libs file for OS/2-eComStation are available since 
11 Jan 2010, 15 days ago

Total of downloads reach 353 as current value, which 245 are for binaries

Current 353 downloads are distributed as:
   harbour-2.0.0.bin-os2.watcom.zip        83    34 %
   harbour-2.0.0.bin-os2.gcc433.zip        59    24 %
   harbour-2.0.0.bin-os2.gcc335omf.zip     44    18 %
   harbour-2.0.0.bin-os2.gcc335aout.zip    59    24 %
and
   harbour-2.0.0.contrib-os2.zip          108

and we have a new winner: for now Harbour 2.0.0 binaries is the champion 
in number of downloads in Harbour for OS/2 history

Harbour beta3 have 239 downloads since 15 Jun, 2007 (many months) and 
was previous champion

So in one month Harbour 2.0.0 have 245*100/239=102 % of Harbour beta3

We have interesting results:
( pattern is very close to first report )
a) Surprisely "most wanted" choice is OpenWatcom with 34 %
b) os2gcc433 is second choice with 24 %, now paired with traditional 
os2gcc335
c) gcc OMF type are ahead of a.out type (24 %), with 24 % (433)+ 18 %
(335omf) = 42 %
  Considering OpenWatcom too, OMF type have 42%+34% = 76%
d) Old os2gcc335 in a.out type have 24 % of current preference

Results confirm that we took the right decisions:
1) Keep support of OS/2-OpenWatcom
2) Inclusion of OMF type support in gcc4xx and gcc335
3) Inclusion of newer os2gcc4xx support

As numbers show, binaries raised a good interest in Harbour for OS/2, 
and contribs, delivered later, confirmed firmly that interest
( A great miss was hbqt )

Thanks to everyone

Ok. My mistake. I based my choice on xHarbour manual saying:
"Setting the locking scheme to 1 will lock the database files like
CA-Clipper 5.2 does. To use CA-Clipper 5.3's locking scheme, set
DBFLOCKSCHEME to 2. This will emulate shared locks using exclusive locks.
Visual FoxPro's locking scheme is selected with DBFLOCKSCHEME set to 3."

I ever link ntxita.obj, also in DBFNTX build.

The problem is ONLY in Cl52+DBFCDX. With app built with Harbour or 
Cl52+DBFNTX all works fine.
The Rlock() returns .t. in all the builded app, BUT ONLY in
Cl52+DBFCDX exits a "Lock required" error at subsequent field replace.
This happens also if the Cl52+DBFCDX is the ONLY program running on
the network...
So, i think that the problem is not deriving from my code... Same code
 works fine in all other points of app updating a record.

The feel i receive from your message is that i'm going in a puzzled
 challenge, so i think i'll have two options:
A) To leave the Cl52+DBFNTX app, working well from twenty year ago, and
   to change the driver of Harbour to DBFNTX
B) To take the courage of replace with Harbour+DBFCDX all the install

I don't know the effectiveness of the DBFNTX in Harbour, so i ask you
 if also the A) choice is dangerous and the pure Harbour path is the only
affordable.
My great thanks for your support and precious feedback.
Best regards.

Not great.. anyway something I have suspected when observing 
xhb at the time I added -xhb flag. To make things worse the 
commercial demo edition of xhb (this the only xhb binary build 
on my system), it's named 'xHBdll.dll'. I see no separate MT 
version around, although there seems to be a debug (?) version 
by the name 'xHBddll.dll'.

I'll add the versionless .dll names for mingw targets for now.

Okay. I'll update it for MinGW for now.

I'm not very optimistic about the rest, as it was 
a huge job to make this consistent across all targets 
in Harbour (also for .dlls).

> BTW I have also some questions about filters in hbmk2 script files.
> Does -help output describe all condition variables?

No, a few ones are missing. I'll add them. Plus envvars 
can also be used, which is not mentioned in help (but 
I will skip this for now, it's very niche feature).

You can find all recognized filter keywords in function 
'hbmk_KEYW()' @ hbmk2.prg.

Filter affects the whole option regardless of where you 
place it. Multiple filters are not supported, so only the 
first one will be parsed as such.

To achieve the above you can use this solution:
-o{win&!bcc}myname-win
-o{win&bcc}myname-win-bcc

It most probably is possible, I've created such .hbc file 
for MiniGUI: contrib/utils/hbmk2/examples/minigui.hbc 
(now it's also in official MiniGUI distro, so this one 
can be deleted now):

For me it works on all platforms by using 'libpng', 
probably because I use the (default case) embedded 
version.

Maybe we should call it hbpng, like we do with zlib 
and pcre, but I won't be able to dedicate a few days 
now just to retest this whole matter from ground up :(

I can't oversee this solution, but if it 
helps us to loosen this dependency, you're 
probably right.

We can make it just like for PCRE library by registering
the function in init code. I can implement it.

I've already fixed it but forgot to commit. Sorry.
I'll commit in a while. The problem was caused by HB_EXTERN_C
macro which is not defined by xHarbour in pure C mode.

Thanks a lot. Is there anything against using the BEGIN/END 
method in all cases? If there isn't, it'd simplify logic.

Subject: [Harbour] Clipper vs Harbour: exclusive access
Message-ID: <2386af1b1001260704l44873ad7oaa19dcbaf580b90d@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Przemek and All,

I want to share my observations how differs
Clipper and Harbour IO activity on exclusive opened dbf file.

Clipper 5.2 and 5.3 module dbf1.c, function dbfRead on shared
database reads only selected record with _fsRead,
but for exclusive database reads in 1024 bytes chunks
as many records, as possible with _xpage_read.
The same with writing: shared with _fsWrite and exclusive
with _xpage_update.

Harbour reads and writes records one-by-one not depending on
access mode.

Prepared simple wrappers to Clipper low-level APIs _fs*,
and Harbour APIs hb_fs* from module filesys.c registers
calls to these APIs.

Sample:

proc main()
  local i
  field F1

 dbCreate("TEST", {{"F1", "N", 10, 0}})
 USE TEST EXCLUSIVE NEW

 for i := 1 to 100
   dbAppend(); F1 := i
   if empty( i % 5 )
     dbDelete()
   endif
 next

 __dbPack()

 dbCloseArea()
return

>From logs we can see, that Clipper uses for this sample
12 calls (4 read and 8 write).
Harbour uses 302 calls (102 read and 180 write)!
Log file attached.

Clipper uses buffering data on IO requests.
Buffering can speed up IO quite a bit.
Rather than reading one record at a time from the network or disk,
Clipper reads a larger block at a time. This is typically much faster,
big amount of IO requests detrimental to performance in network
environment.

Is there plans to introduce buffered IO for dbf files?

With best regards,
Saulius

Hi,

> Now everyone who use WIN_PRN class has to link his code
> with PNG library even if it's unnecessary.

PNG library is used in win_BitMapDimensions, now is not used in WIN_PRN class to print win_BMPs class.
Note that now it's a RAW implementation driver dependent and some drivers don't need the original dimensions to work.
Unfortunately the PNG support is few used in win drivers.
win_BitMapDimensions works fine and can be nice changed win_BMP class with attache sample prg.
Perhaps in future, we can change it to not RAW driver dependent and convert these formats into DIB plane but now, I don't know 
how do it and if this is correct.
What do you think about?

Best regards,
Xavi

It is because it's in the same file as other functions used by
WIN_BMP class and WIN_BMP class is used by WIN_PRN. Just simply
try to link this code without png library:

   proc main()
      win_prn()
   return

Anyhow moving WIN_BITMAPDIMENSIONS() to separate file is also good
idea. It would resolve current dependency problem. Anyhow if you
want to use above function in WIN_BMP class then we still need
some type of startup initialization controlled by REQUEST mechanism.

It's good idea but it would be very nice to keep it modular.
We can try to use startup initialization or we can define separate
classes with common interface i.e. HB_PNG which can be accepted by
WIN_PRN just like WIN_BMP.

The BMP class modifications are all good, but the WIN_BMP() 
separation would not by itself solve the libpng dependency, 
since WIN_DRAWBITMAP() is still used from WIN_PRN(), and 
this function resides in the same file where PNG dependent 
stuff is. Plus even we separate those two, the libpng 
dependency stays to be a problem for everyone using 
WIN_BMP(), and since everyone likes to print logos, 
I'd guess many (if not most) users would end up needed 
libpng anyway.

For me BTW, libpng dependency isn't such a huge problem, 
and creating such dependencies is sooner or later 
inevitable, which means on the longer term it cannot 
be avoided with tricks anyway.

What is important IMO is to solve such dependency 
so that it works on all supported platforms and 
environments, and in this case I think the problem 
part could cross-builds. I hope someone can test it.

For pure Windows users it's as easy as adding libpng 
to the liblist or using hbwin.hbc as I told previously.
We're in trunk so such changes are acceptable, and 
users following development should adapt now, final 
users can adapt on next release. After all .png 
printing is quite an important feature these days.

As for converting PNG/JPEG to DIB, I absolutely agree.
It just have to be written.

For JPEG support we will need to include it in /external, 
and if there is no objection I can do it even now, I 
have it ready locally since quite some time now, just 
upgraded to v8 days ago.

Brgds,
Viktor

How hbide Will be used  for easy editing harbour itself?

Two way may be used:
open as way:hbdir use same makefile information for editing project
Import project way: from one makefile to hbc like for xmate

IMO HBIDE has nothing to do with our GNU Makefiles.

Now Harbour examples already have an .hbp file each, 
and on the longer run I plan to add .hbp files to each 
contrib also, as soon as we make the switch from GNU Make 
to hbmk2 build system for them. At this point each contrib 
will be just a normal 3rd party lib hosted in Harbour SVN, 
and HBIDE can be used to open them as is.

I'd think this direction is a better investment that 
making HBIDE suited to read all the makefiles in the world.

Brgds,
Viktor

usefull also for xharbour or other project with that use gnu

Please note that 'makefile' is not a standard file format, 
it's rather a language. There cannot be a generic reader 
written for it, unless HBIDE will contain a full blown 
GNU Make script parser, which is IMO not our goal.

Even Harbour 'Makefile' content is not trivial to parse, 
and doesn't contain enough information to create a build 
from it.

Brgds,
Viktor

Ok, I got it.
It means it is approptiate to change the label 
"Dll" to "Dynamic Library" in "Projects" tree.

Yes. Pls make sure to fall back to "Executable" 
if none of these options are found in .hbp.

Hello Viktor

How should I handle .lib extensions while converting 
from a .xhp file? One way I think is:

c:\myfolder\mylib.lib

Strip the paths from all .libs
Club common paths in link properties => -Lc:\myfolder
Put only file name without extension => -lmylib

Or there is a better way ?

Hi Pripal,

How about a feature to insert  with a press of a key the missing 'close code
construct' like endif , next , endcase.

& a beautifier. Now this needs a lot of user customization options.


Great work anyhow! keep it up!

Thanks,
Abe

PS : Can you post _ONE_ request per thread ?
      Also put heading to the topic with exact request.
      It becomes cumbersome to locate what the request is and what are the
replies.

Yes, this is the proper way.

hbmk2 already has an xMate to .hbp conversion option, 
I'd suggest to use this in HBIDE:
   hbmk2 -xhp=<file.xhp>

Pls hold on a little, I have to commit some fix to it.

In the meantime could you send me a sample .xhp file?
hbmk2 doesn't currently support parsing lib files, as 
I probably didn't have such example.

Yes, it is wrong.
   HB_HMERGRE( <h1>, <h2> [, <nMethod> | <bCode> ] )

if 3-rd parameter is codeblock then it is evaluated against each
item pair (key=>value) in source (<h2>) hash array. It receives 3
parameters: key, value, position. Then if it returns true the given
item pair (key=>value) is added to the destination hash array.

if 3-rd parameter is numeric value then it defines method of sets
merging. It can be:
   #define HB_HASH_UNION      0  /* logical OR  on items in two hash tables */
   #define HB_HASH_INTERSECT  1  /* logical AND on items in two hash tables */
   #define HB_HASH_DIFFERENCE 2  /* logical XOR on items in two hash tables */
   #define HB_HASH_REMOVE     3  /* h1 & ( h1 ^ h2 ) */

by default HB_HASH_UNION is used.

The name is confusion. These .obj files change collation order in
Clipper VM and all index formats not omnly NTX.

The DBFCDX driver from CL5.2 has few very serious bugs which can cause
memory corruption which can cause any other bad side effects so everything
is possible.

It's possible.

It's probably safer method. Anyhow as long as some network transport
layer does not cause some separate buffering which can cause problems
when DOS and Windows applications access files concurrently then it
should be safe to share database files and indexes between Clipper
and Harbour. It's enough to set compatible national sorting and locking
schemes.

In Harbour DBFNTX is probably much faster then in Clipper and for sure
they can be used to index realy big tables (I know that some people
use Harbour only to reindex files for Clipper due to huge speed differnce
and the fact that over some size limits Clipper begins to GPF during
indexing). Harbour DBFNTX implementation also supports all CDX extensions
and few others but you will not be able to enable all of them if you want
to share data with Clipper. Compound index, large NTX file support up to
4TB or using RECNO as hidden part of index key to eliminate linear scan
during record updating in indexes uses keys with big number of repeated
values are extensions which change index formats and I implemented them
only in Harbour and xHarbour so only in these languages can operate on
such NTX indexes.
Technically NTX format is much faster then CDX. In the ideal environment
where you have a lot of RAM and you can keep index files in memory CDX
is many times slower then NTX. But we are not leaving in ideal world and
in most of cases indexes are accessed using slow network connections.
It means that the size of index files will determinate the speed. CDX
files store keys in leaf nodes in compressed form what greatly reduces
the total index size and it's the reason of better overall performance
when the cost of reading/writing from/to index file is very big, i.e.
files are stored on file server.

Some formatting constructs are there in <Edit><Format> option.
But I agree a full blown formatter is a must applied in full source 
or a fragmanet thereof.

We will think about it later as to what tool to use,
hbformat or xMate's.

Yes. Clipper seems to use the same caches with 1024 bytes page size
for indexes and exclusive mode DBF tables.

Harbour does not use any caches so far with the exception to
index tree paths but it's only few pages so it can be ignored.

In current RDD code all IO API is redirected to replaceable IO functions
so anyone can write such caching system for all core RDDs without touching
their code. It's enough to write simple HB_FILE IO driver like NETIO or
MEMIO. I can try to write it in some spare time but maybe someone else
can do it too. As I can see you wrote some wrappers to Clipper functions
so I guess you have enough knowledge to create new HB_FILE IO driver
adding buffering for all files open in exclusive mode with name starting
with "buf:".
What do you think about it?

Just curious of your answers...

I'm looking for some cross platform tool to quickly design user interface
and then refine event methods and then compile it with harbour

Something similar to this http://glade.gnome.org/ ( Glade  + Python )
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7421

Can be a hbide future extension...?

Thank you and best regards.

Download the sources .-

http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source

Also, I think that zip archive has the includes .-

http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows

"Advanced users can also download a _zip archive_ of the binaries, without the installer."

Why should we concentrate on GTK when all our future goals
are planned for Qt ?

I have on my TODO list, integration of Qt Creator through Hbp*()
classes. Qt Creator generates a .ui file and hbIDE is already taking 
advantage of .ui files. We just need to polish this HbpQtUI() class 
to embed events, though practically you can do it right now.

I think that Harbour use type HB_LONG defined as LONGLONG,
and LONGLONG is 64bit type

Your technical analysis is very useful and only now i realize that the
NTX rdd is expanded in Harbour. A quick view on whatsnew.txt told me
that was present yet in version 0.46.
Anyway, the Harbour CDX install on all clients could be the safer choice,
as you say.
Again my great thanks for your support and kindness.
Best regards.

Even a video will do.

Message-ID: <27941D3C-4ADB-4097-9416-C90F38B06035@syenar.hu>

Hi Pritpal,

hbpqtui is a QT specific class, and while I understand 
the feature is useful, such class should reside in HBQT, 
not HBXBP, since it's not, or not easily portable functionality. 
Just think about the case if we'd like to create an HBXBP 
compatible library, but based on a different GUI subsystem 
(GTK, WX, whatever).

Brgds,
Viktor

hbIDE itself is a working tutorial. Simply look into the sources, 
mainly ideprojmanager.prg and search for HbpQtUI(). The underlying
dialog is generated by Qt Creator and relevant .ui is placed in 
harbour/conrib/hbide/resources/*.ui.

Hope you will understand.

I will write a descent help manual once I am done with hbIDE.

It is scheduled to be compatible with Xbp framework.
That is why I put it there. As I am only concerned with Qt
at this moment I have decided it to be put under there only.
Many more clsses are under pipeline as discussed earlier 
and I do not care what sub-sytems come in the future.
So far nobody has even thought of them.

"I don't care"? Great answer, so I don't care about 
HBQT + HBXBP + HBIDE either. That will free a lot of 
valuable time to spend on better things.

Yes, it probably is a good idea to move them 
to separate project(s). The reason is that they 
grow in unbelievable rate, but even root problems 
are not solved and not even being dealt with 
(= ignored), and this I believe will take an 
unnecessarily huge amount of fixing work in a 
lot of existing code on all levels.

In my view we should concentrate on the basics 
first and then build the upper levels on the 
this base. Plus it's also good if basic things 
agreed upon in the past are more or adhered to, 
or at least remembered.

IMO we're at the point when moving HBQT, HBXBP 
and HBIDE to their own repositories would be of 
a benefit for all projects, without losing too 
much.

Anyway "I don't care" is pretty much the opposite 
of how things are supposed to be done here in 
Harbour, particularly when it comes to basic 
system design methods. If you ignore these, the 
quality of these components will hardly be equal 
to that of Harbour. And if we want to keep quality 
image of Harbour intact (which is the result of 
10 years of development in this spirit), all 
components should adhere to this.

Please consider these, even if the "heat" of 
quick development is stronger these days. It's 
much harder to fix design problems afterwards.

Brgds,
Viktor

Sorry, still not enough ;(

But I think if file starts with "buf:" prefix, file access mode can't
influence buffering, this must be added for all prefixed files.
Like in Novell client there are settings: 'file caching' (all files) and
'file caching on exclusively opened files'. It is user decision.

Viktor , Pritpal

I think you have to consider that many people , including us,  Bruno and
Carozo
are using HBQT to develope another library.

Your disagreements can ruin a lot of work made in lasts months

HBQT , HBIDE and HBXBP could become one of major GOALS of
harbour community , without underestimate , the great work of all harbour
community.

I begg you all , to reconsider these changes , taking this in mind.

I think that at least , HBQT must remain in Contrib, and with full support
of Harbour Community

as an oficial Graphic Library .

I know that is opensource software and I can't clame to anybody

But think about this

Best Regards

Bruno

Hi!

Even today I have my own implementation of Qt for Harbour and I want
to leave soon to use HBQT...  I work with Pascal language in the
Windows environment and I have an dream: develop  an HCL like VCL
using HBQT (even if it is for own use)

Because this I think (me too) "that at least , HBQT must remain in
Contrib, and with full support of Harbour Community" is the best
choice.

My 2 cents,
Vailton Renato

I invite viktor and pritpal find the way of cooperation
same way that have made in hbmk same modification for having a better hbide
Harbour will help Pritpal find a better "quality"
Pritpal can help harbour to have a GUI
Please no division
with a division we lost
either part lost

enforced by differences without split

All users should see that the URL (f.e.: sf.net/harbour vs. sf.net/hbqt) 
of a project (or library) won't make it less useful / sexy / used / 
developed or less desirable. It stays the same project, with same 
users and volunteer contributors.

In fact, in separate repositories it can even flourish better, 
since there is no higher level or quality rules to adhere to, nor 
getting an agreement from other project maintainers. This give 
full freedom in the hands of developers. It also makes it that 
everyone can much better concentrate on the area he is interested 
in.

It also makes things to scale much better.

There are several good examples for this, in no particular order: 
HWGUI, MINIGUI, WXHARBOUR, LETODB, XHGTK. Some of these wouldn't 
be fit to Harbour SVN, because our stricter rules or portability 
requirements. Yet they are useful, users keep using them, developers 
keep developing them. Sometimes even Harbour developers are 
participants in them.

Being part of Harbour SVN is partly a deal: It has some benefits, 
f.e. you get support and attention from core developers 
(f.e. i've spent several weeks on HBQT altogether), you get quality 
control, a build infrastructure, you have free packaging a release 
"service", more attention, etc. Most of these require a significant 
amount of time. So, in return IMO we rightfully expect for things 
to be more or less inline with basic project goals and rules 
and agreements.

It also seems a natural thing that components like _Harbour core_ 
need much stricter quality control than upper level ones, since 
everything is based on them, and this is the key to the stability of 
the whole platform. While I personally believe that all components 
should have equally good quality to form a good quality end result, 
practice shows that this is sometimes not achievable in practice, 
due to limited resource or not enough interest in this area, even 
sometimes the time consumed would not be justified or even noticed 
at the end. I can accept that.

At the end it comes out as: Is this deal worthwhile for all 
parties? If it's a time wasting struggle for quality on one end, 
and an uncomfortable feeling on the other end, what is the 
point? Users won't benefit either, since developers are wasting 
time instead of developing.

The other option is to lower quality needs, not think about 
future, of redundancy of any form, priorities, or leaks, 
allow GPFs and allow design decisions which will have such 
a high "cost" in the future, that at that point nobody will 
be able to deal with it anymore. See HBWHAT32 for an example 
for that.

For a solution IMO we should seriously consider to split 
Harbour into more parts, it has become huge and if this 
continues it will become unmanageable and rather sooner or 
later no quality can be guaranteed for some of its parts. 
BTW, HBQT related parts now account for nearly HALF of the 
size of all contribs. This is large.

I also think this community did it's job to help bring HBQT 
+ parts to a nice, usable level now, and it can perfectly 
stand on its own.

I'm glad to hear opinions on how to solve these in other ways.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hello Viktor,

I totally agree with your thinking.

In fact I was restraining myself on moving wxHarbour to Harbour contrib for the very same reasons.


best regards to all,

IMHO HBQT+HBXBP+HBIDE need to be outlined and cleaned and should go
into a separate project with a separate mailing list.

You are right Angel.

Harbour must have a multi-platform GUI support as an integral (core) 
component to succeed.

IMHO There is some things to consider to achieve that:

1. Basic core GUI classes must be defined as 'Harbour own' classes, 
then, do wrappers to connect it to the GUI framework selected to do this 
development. Expose to users (Harbour programemrs) the QT, GTK (or 
whatever) API should be not a solution.

As I've pointed in other posts, classes defined by Clipper 5.3 could be 
a good starting point.

Another big advantage of this approach is that Clipper console 
applications could run (with minimal modifications) on NATIVE GUI MODE 
for ALL OSs supported by Harbour.

IMHO this point is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, since it will turn Harbour in 
the natural succesor to Clipper for all OSs without a doubt.


2. The GUI framework behind this scheme must be choosen carefully and 
afetr a deep evaluation.

IMHO, QT is not a good choice. Compared with (ie) GTK, it is bigger, 
slower and more difficult. I don't want to start a flame with this, I 
understand that a lot of people think different. My opinions are based 
on my own tests only.


3. In the case that it be possible, the extension of these features to 
give to current and future Harbour users, some kind of native support to 
create web-enabled applications, should be considered.

Desktop applications will not dissapear right now, but its use will 
decrease steadily in the next years, reducing the user base of products 
like Harbour, a lot.

Roberto.

I'm not saying Harbour doesn't need a GUI.

There are many developers that create GUI apps with Harbour using
FiveWin, HWGUI, minigui, xHGtk, ...

Here is the only part of messages where agree


Think for a developer how much is difficult give different and
incompatible version, different installer
MINIGUI have included harbour inside his distribution and imo this is
not good way
Viktor itself speaking with roberto have encontred same ot this
(different version) ecc
cause problem also if resolve other

can be a solution Define rule of stricter quality control so  is easy
undestrand with rule is not respected
hbqt + hbxbp+ hbide is a good part for harbour and i not undestrand why remove

Development of  hbide have cause same problem but also intesting produtc

What Think Przemyslaw ?

very true.

when when Pritpal said 'I don't care' I understood him saying 'I can't
care', responding to Viktor's fears that in the future when somebody else
will decide to build on top of hbqt/hbxbp they will run into difficulties.
So Prinpal responded that at the _moment_ while hammering out
hbqt/hbxbp/hbide (which still needs more regression, and getting there by
the day) he _can't care_ for the unseen future.

Yes, but i was thinking that HBQT would become the "official" multiplatform

Hum, the freedom from stricter rules results in a bad integration with the
main project. I come from the HwGUI experience, where only the effective
work of Przemek allows to tune and clean many dirty or dubbed code.
When i begun my interest in HwGUI, the Harbour build was lost because the
active developers was interested mainly in xHarbour implementation.
Just you, Viktor, signaled me the thing and i discouvered the great
advantages
of Harbour vs. xHarbour.

I agree with the standard good quality for all components (contribs
included) of the project, at the cost of a slower but effective development.

I don't want to think about the lack of collaboration between the
main project and the HBQT... Just think to hbmk2 implementations
to adhere to hbIDE needs...

Maybe HBQT by itself, if we stop to think to it as "official" GUI, but
hbIDE project is very linked to main Harbour and HBQT, so a self
growing and developing of HBQT could break the hbIDE work.

>I'm glad to hear opinions on how to solve these in other ways.

No opinions, but the feel that a contrib part of Harbour project
MUST obey to general rules and follow the general architecture of
the main project. So, IMHO, Pritpal could consider the opinion of
Viktor as effective, mainly if thought to medium-large time, and
i hope he will return to strict collaboration as we saw in the last
days.

Just my 1.5 cents...
Maurizio

Calling it "vanity" when it doesn't serve your short-term 
purpose, but welcoming it when it produces a good quality 
product doesn't give too much to this topic. And I'm 
certainly not interested in going personal.

We can agree that GUI is generally a good thing, without 
going into deeper analysis.

Nothing tells though that the GUI needs to reside in the 
same physical repository, nor does anything tells, that 
core developers have to deal with it, too. Also nothing 
tells, that only one GUI should exist for one base system.

Looking around the compiler "market", I can't see similar 
compilers which have an integrated, built-in, selected GUI 
as part of core. 

Of course also nothing tells that Harbour can't have 
one core quality GUI that comes with it automatically 
while allowing also other options.

And if you remember the discussions from the beginning, 
and seeing the amount of care from my side f.e., you 
could see that no so secretly I believed that HBQT 
could have become this selected GUI for Harbour.

But, such selected GUI should be of core quality.

Brgds,
Viktor

I agree 110% about core quality, but some desitions should be made by 
more than one person and with the right wording and you where mean in 
your answer to Pritpal.

As you've seen there are many visions about the roadmap.

This is not a personal attack in any way.
We're in a group, so we must treat each other with respect.

And yes, I agree with your original post about sep?rating hbpParts from 
xbpParts.

As almost allways your vision of the big picture is right.

And this:

was absolutely out of context and/or order.

Hi Roberto
I agree we need gui today and in long term web
why a common class like xbase++ part (XHB also without hb extension)
can't be a solution?
Today this class is wrapped to hbQT and Tomorrow to gtk,minigui or fivewin
we also implement a set syntax to that can reference this class
instead of internal gui
replacement syntax of gui
This idea came from vianemo project not jet started

Most probably not, Massimo, I'm sorry. I'm one of those submarine guys
in the harbour, just popping up from time to time (and I hope that's
okay!). I'm not doing any xbase programming these days, but I try to
keep in sync with the developments within the Harbour project - and I
can only express my deepest respect for what you guys have achieved so
far...

Cheers,
Martin

I agree. I had a quick look at them, but I did not feel competent enough
to enter the correct information (otherwise I would have just done it!)

Hi

+1
HBQT library, the "oficial" Harbour wrapper to accessing GUI multiplatform
API

The progress of hbqt,hbIde,hbxbp is amazing.
IMHO because of excelent cooperation of Pritpal,Victor,Przemys?aw and
others, which
are all experts.
I am curently using minigui extended for my applications, which is perfect
GUI,
but it's only win32 oriented.
I tried GTK (which is in transition to 3.0, and will get clutter as
animation appi).
I also tried wxWidgets.
IMHO Qt is most mature GUI toolkit (best documentation, best ide, bigest
comunity...).
IMHO the future is in web UI (embeded browser, be it GECKO or WEBKIT) with
javascritpt
for scripting (in next version of Qt, there wil be QML).
My dream platform is: Harbour+Qt+QtWebkit+OpenOffice (ODF documents).
So please don't break the team apart, because of single statement. 
(probably missanderstanding).

submarine guys in the harbour is a very good definition compliment
A high number of user , give very good words about harbour here
I invite spread good Harbour opinion also out of this mailing list
Harbour is modern and reliable solution for busines application based
on database
Imo follow good stat is due to of Large spectre of solution
(dbf,sql,client server) (console or gui) (command line,visual version)
(Single thread or multi thread)
Hi hope that we maintain one project with hbqt but this is another thread

I only say that could be more convenient to establish a first "modest" 
goal for a basic, compact, multi-platform GUI bundled with Harbour and 
working "out of the box".

This way an user could download Harbour binaries for Windows, Linux, 
OS/2 or Mac and have native/basic GUI support for all those OSs.

Being the first target a small set of GUI classes, the project could be 
working in the term of weeks (or months) and not years.

It could be expanded in all imaginable ways (even xbase++ parts) in 
future Harbour versions.


Regards,

Roberto.

Hello All,

the idea of having a multi-platform GUI in Harbour
core and which, if proved to be the effective implementation,
will be "officially" declared Harbour GUI framework.
Then list looked for which GUI base system
we were to adopt. Quicky arrived the solution that
QT is the _cleanest_ of all implementations and we
should go in this direction. I read some basic
documentation of Qt and got convinced that this is
achievable. The only hitch was how to start. Someone
readily made available the base skeltons. I did some
experiments with those skeletons and realized some results.
The _idea_ fascinated me deeply and I confirmed to the list
that I am ready to take this challenge. List approved
it, decided on the name-space, repository location,
and rest is the history.

Everybody moved in this direction, thank you.

The whole concept has barely born ( 9 months womb )
and we have _planned_ to re-habilitate it in some alien
world, without considering the chances of its survival.
I cannot imagine how cruel can we.

All those 10m-10days I have lived into this project,
day or night, office or home, awake or asleep,
without any expectation or consideration, without
any call for my personal needs, but simply with
an urge of _creativity_ and a feeling that I must
_return to the language_ which has given me my
bread_and_butter all these years.

I took the responsibility [ not that you forced ]
to ease out the modern-day pressure of GUI demands
on Harbour users and to provide a strong framework
over which we could lay our futures. I do not know
how much I have been successful, you are the better
judge, but I am satisfied about the fact that the mission
I had chosen, I sincerly worked hard to achieve.

Today I am feeling I am much relieved of such,
self-imposed, responsibility. I can feel I have
the time to _stand and stare_.

Did you ever thought that this action will send
a strong message to the world that Harbour refrains
from GUI, _please_ do not step-in.

I am aware, and have ever followed the design goals
of the project, and am committed not to over-step it
in any way. But to be treated like this, without
understanding the content of my message, just...

Below is the text of messages sent on the list,
in the context of my above emotions, for easy grasp.

Bottom line: I will try to upload to _Harbour SVN_
whatever I could implement in Qt based
gtqtc, hbQT, hbXBP and hbIDE twice a day, but if
I could not, it will remain confined to my laptop.

Pritpal Bedi

---------------------------------------------------------------

hbpqtui is a QT specific class, and while I understand
the feature is useful, such class should reside in HBQT,
not HBXBP, since it's not, or not easily portable functionality.
Just think about the case if we'd like to create an HBXBP
compatible library, but based on a different GUI subsystem
(GTK, WX, whatever).

--------------

   It is scheduled to be compatible with Xbp framework.
   That is why I put it there. As I am only concerned with Qt
   at this moment I have decided it to be put under there only.
   Many more clsses are under pipeline as discussed earlier
   and I do not care what sub-sytems come in the future.
   So far nobody has even thought of them.

--------------

      "I don't care"? Great answer, so I don't care about
      HBQT + HBXBP + HBIDE either. That will free a lot of
      valuable time to spend on better things.

--------------

         Upto you Viktor.
         You can delete these contributions from the SVN.

--------------

            Yes, it probably is a good idea to move them
            to separate project(s). The reason is that they
            grow in unbelievable rate, but even root problems
            are not solved and not even being dealt with
            (= ignored), and this I believe will take an
            unnecessarily huge amount of fixing work in a
            lot of existing code on all levels.
            /
            In my view we should concentrate on the basics
            first and then build the upper levels on the
            this base. Plus it's also good if basic things
            agreed upon in the past are more or adhered to,
            or at least remembered.
            /
            IMO we're at the point when moving HBQT, HBXBP
            and HBIDE to their own repositories would be of
            a benefit for all projects, without losing too
            much.
            /
            Anyway "I don't care" is pretty much the opposite
            of how things are supposed to be done here in
            Harbour, particularly when it comes to basic
            system design methods. If you ignore these, the
            quality of these components will hardly be equal
            to that of Harbour. And if we want to keep quality
            image of Harbour intact (which is the result of
            10 years of development in this spirit), all
            components should adhere to this.
            /
            Please consider these, even if the "heat" of
            quick development is stronger these days. It's
            much harder to fix design problems afterwards.

--------------

   I think you have to consider that many people , including us,  Bruno and
Carozo
   are using HBQT to develope another library.
   Your disagreements can ruin a lot of work made in lasts months
   HBQT , HBIDE and HBXBP could become one of major GOALS of
   harbour community , without underestimate , the great work of all harbour
community.
   I begg you all , to reconsider these changes , taking this in mind.
   I think that at least , HBQT must remain in Contrib, and with full
support of Harbour Community
   as an oficial Graphic Library .
   I know that is opensource software and I can't clame to anybody
   But think about this

--------------

   Even today I have my own implementation of Qt for Harbour and I want
   to leave soon to use HBQT...  I work with Pascal language in the
   Windows environment and I have an dream: develop  an HCL like VCL
   using HBQT (even if it is for own use)
   /
   Because this I think (me too) "that at least , HBQT must remain in
   Contrib, and with full support of Harbour Community" is the best
   choice.

--------------

   I invite viktor and pritpal find the way of cooperation
   same way that have made in hbmk same modification for having a better
hbide
   Harbour will help Pritpal find a better "quality"
   Pritpal can help harbour to have a GUI
   Please no division
   with a division we lost
   either part lost
   /
   enforced by differences without split

--------------

            All users should see that the URL (f.e.: sf.net/harbour vs.
sf.net/hbqt)
            of a project (or library) won't make it less useful / sexy /
used /
            developed or less desirable. It stays the same project, with
same
            users and volunteer contributors.
            /
               This is true, but...
            /
            In fact, in separate repositories it can even flourish better,
            since there is no higher level or quality rules to adhere to,
nor
            getting an agreement from other project maintainers. This give
            full freedom in the hands of developers. It also makes it that
            everyone can much better concentrate on the area he is
interested
            in.
            /
               Yes, but i was thinking that HBQT would become the "official"
multiplatform
               GUI for Harbour


                  +1
                  HBQT library, the "oficial" Harbour wrapper to accessing
GUI multiplatform API
            /
            It also makes things to scale much better.
            /
            There are several good examples for this, in no particular
order:
            HWGUI, MINIGUI, WXHARBOUR, LETODB, XHGTK. Some of these wouldn't
            be fit to Harbour SVN, because our stricter rules or portability
            requirements. Yet they are useful, users keep using them,
developers
            keep developing them. Sometimes even Harbour developers are
            participants in them.
            /
               Hum, the freedom from stricter rules results in a bad
integration with the
               main project. I come from the HwGUI experience, where only
the effective
               work of Przemek allows to tune and clean many dirty or dubbed
code.
               When i begun my interest in HwGUI, the Harbour build was lost
because the
               active developers was interested mainly in xHarbour
implementation.
               Just you, Viktor, signaled me the thing and i discouvered the
great
               advantages
               of Harbour vs. xHarbour.
            /
            Being part of Harbour SVN is partly a deal: It has some
benefits,
            f.e. you get support and attention from core developers
            (f.e. i've spent several weeks on HBQT altogether), you get
quality
            control, a build infrastructure, you have free packaging a
release
            "service", more attention, etc. Most of these require a
significant
            amount of time. So, in return IMO we rightfully expect for
things
            to be more or less inline with basic project goals and rules
            and agreements.
            /
            It also seems a natural thing that components like _Harbour
core_
            need much stricter quality control than upper level ones, since
            everything is based on them, and this is the key to the
stability of
            the whole platform. While I personally believe that all
components
            should have equally good quality to form a good quality end
result,
            practice shows that this is sometimes not achievable in
practice,
            due to limited resource or not enough interest in this area,
even
            sometimes the time consumed would not be justified or even
noticed
            at the end. I can accept that.
            /
               I agree with the standard good quality for all components
(contribs
               included) of the project, at the cost of a slower but
effective development.
            /
            At the end it comes out as: Is this deal worthwhile for all
            parties? If it's a time wasting struggle for quality on one end,
            and an uncomfortable feeling on the other end, what is the
            point? Users won't benefit either, since developers are wasting
            time instead of developing.
            /
            The other option is to lower quality needs, not think about
            future, of redundancy of any form, priorities, or leaks,
            allow GPFs and allow design decisions which will have such
            a high "cost" in the future, that at that point nobody will
            be able to deal with it anymore. See HBWHAT32 for an example
            for that.
            /
            For a solution IMO we should seriously consider to split
            Harbour into more parts, it has become huge and if this
            continues it will become unmanageable and rather sooner or
            later no quality can be guaranteed for some of its parts.
            BTW, HBQT related parts now account for nearly HALF of the
            size of all contribs. This is large.
            /
               I don't want to think about the lack of collaboration between
the
               main project and the HBQT... Just think to hbmk2
implementations
               to adhere to hbIDE needs...
            /
            I also think this community did it's job to help bring HBQT
            + parts to a nice, usable level now, and it can perfectly
            stand on its own.
            /
               Maybe HBQT by itself, if we stop to think to it as "official"
GUI, but
               hbIDE project is very linked to main Harbour and HBQT, so a
self
               growing and developing of HBQT could break the hbIDE work.
            /
            I'm glad to hear opinions on how to solve these in other ways.
            /
               No opinions, but the feel that a contrib part of Harbour
project
               MUST obey to general rules and follow the general
architecture of
               the main project. So, IMHO, Pritpal could consider the
opinion of
               Viktor as effective, mainly if thought to medium-large time,
and
               i hope he will return to strict collaboration as we saw in
the last
               days.

               Here is the only part of messages where agree
               /
               Think for a developer how much is difficult give different

               incompatible version, different installer
               MINIGUI have included harbour inside his distribution and imo

               What Think Przemyslaw ?

--------------

               I totally agree with your thinking.
               /
               In fact I was restraining myself on moving wxHarbour to
Harbour contrib for the very same reasons.

--------------

               IMHO HBQT+HBXBP+HBIDE need to be outlined and cleaned and
should go
               into a separate project with a separate mailing list.

--------------

               A compiler without a GUI Framework leads it to nitche apps:
Servers,
               console and cgi apps.
               A GUI Framework without compiler leads it to death because
lack of support.
               If you do that then no new users will come here.
               Vanity is not a good advisor.

--------------

                  Calling it "vanity" when it doesn't serve your short-term
                  purpose, but welcoming it when it produces a good quality
                  product doesn't give too much to this topic. And I'm
                  certainly not interested in going personal.
                  /
                  We can agree that GUI is generally a good thing, without
                  going into deeper analysis.
                  /
                  Nothing tells though that the GUI needs to reside in the
                  same physical repository, nor does anything tells, that
                  core developers have to deal with it, too. Also nothing
                  tells, that only one GUI should exist for one base system.
                  /
                  Looking around the compiler "market", I can't see similar
                  compilers which have an integrated, built-in, selected GUI
                  as part of core.
                  /
                  Of course also nothing tells that Harbour can't have
                  one core quality GUI that comes with it automatically
                  while allowing also other options.
                  /
                  And if you remember the discussions from the beginning,
                  and seeing the amount of care from my side f.e., you
                  could see that no so secretly I believed that HBQT
                  could have become this selected GUI for Harbour.
                  /
                  But, such selected GUI should be of core quality.

--------------

                     I agree 110% about core quality, but some desitions
should be made by
                     more than one person and with the right wording and you
where mean in
                     your answer to Pritpal.
                     /
                     As you've seen there are many visions about the
roadmap.
                     /
                     This is not a personal attack in any way.
                     We're in a group, so we must treat each other with
respect.
                     /
                     And yes, I agree with your original post about
sep?rating hbpParts from
                     xbpParts.
                     /
                     As almost allways your vision of the big picture is
right.
                     /
                     And this:
                     /
                      > Calling it "vanity" when it doesn't serve your

                     /
                     was absolutely out of context and/or order.

--------------

               when when Pritpal said 'I don't care' I understood him saying
'I can't care',
               responding to Viktor's fears that in the future when somebody
else will
               decide to build on top of hbqt/hbxbp they will run into
difficulties.
               So Prinpal responded that at the _moment_ while hammering out
hbqt/hbxbp/hbide
               (which still needs more regression, and getting there by the
day)
               he _can't care_ for the unseen future.

--------------

               I'm not saying Harbour doesn't need a GUI.
               There are many developers that create GUI apps with Harbour
using
               FiveWin, HWGUI, minigui, xHGtk, ...

--------------

               Pripal is going a Huge works so same reply can be read also

               Hi Roberto
               I agree we need gui today and in long term web
               why a common class like xbase++ part (XHB also without hb
extension)
               can't be a solution?
               Today this class is wrapped to hbQT and Tomorrow to
gtk,minigui or fivewin
               we also implement a set syntax to that can reference this
class
               instead of internal gui
               replacement syntax of gui
               This idea came from vianemo project not jet started

--------------

               The progress of hbqt,hbIde,hbxbp is amazing.
               IMHO because of excelent cooperation of
Pritpal,Victor,Przemyslaw and
               others, which are all experts.
               /
               I am curently using minigui extended for my applications,
which is perfect
               GUI, but it's only win32 oriented. I tried GTK (which is in
transition
               to 3.0, and will get clutter as animation appi). I also tried
wxWidgets.
               IMHO Qt is most mature GUI toolkit (best documentation, best
ide, bigest
               comunity...).
               /
               IMHO the future is in web UI (embeded browser, be it GECKO or
WEBKIT) with
               javascritpt for scripting (in next version of Qt, there wil
be QML).
               My dream platform is: Harbour+Qt+QtWebkit+OpenOffice (ODF
documents).
               So please don't break the team apart, because of single
statement.
               (probably missanderstanding).

Hi Pritpal,

I've sent you a message outlining a problem with 
a serious problem with a QT specific extension in 
HBXBP (which is not meant to be QT specific in 
the first place). Even the name of the XBP class 
has "QT" in it. Your answer is generically to 
such problems is: "I don't care".

What did you exactly expect? I can imagine few 
worse reaction to such technical question.

BTW, many of my similar mails were just a time 
waste, often with no answer. This doesn't convey 
a very good message. And I'm not inventing any 
of these problems/rules, we've agreed upon the basic 
ones before even one line had been written of HBQT 
and the "green light" was given.

And now you're trying to "threaten" Harbour 
maintainers and users to stop all HBQT work if 
you can't get free benefits and the complete 
Harbour SVN environment to develop this project 
by your own rules, by your own "mission 
statement", _inside Harbour SVN_. How is that?

Harbour SVN is not a project repository service.

We already have a missions statement. The mission 
statement of this project is still not to develop 
a GUI, but a compiler, and a good one. Harbour 
doesn't "refrain" from a GUI, it's just not its 
goal. Harbour is busy to offer a very strong API, 
which anybody can build upon, be it a GUI or 
anything else.

If you want to be part of a project (or team, 
or club), I think you should play ball, work as 
a team and accept its rules, not creating your 
own ones. (and if you have difficulty: ask!)

Or you can, but in this case you should seriously 
consider creating a new project, with your own 
mission statement.

Brdgs,
Viktor

Since it's very difficult to make an 
ultimate decision about the best GUI API as 
"official" Harbour, and as it's not very good to 
tie us exclusively to one vendor (like Nokia 
in case of QT), we - before beginning - decided to 
use separate abstraction layers to ease switching 
components in the future.

Specifically we decided that HBXBP should be 
a layer which implements Xbase++ compatible 
GUI classes, with future provision that the 
underlying GUI engine can be changed, so f.e. 
we can have HBXBPGTK or HBXBPWX as plugin 
replacements. This assumes/requires that HBXBP 
can have _no_ QT, GTK or WX specific parts, 
simply because if we introduce such things, we 
break this idea, and reimplementing HBXBP for 
GTK or WX becomes impossible. (who will implement 
an emulator for QT UILOADER class...?) Another 
rule we agreed upon is that HBXBP is pure 
.prg code. [This is adhered, but shortcuts 
are made by implementing HBXBP specific parts 
inside HBQT, which is not the best.]

Instead, the proper solution is to implement 
all QT specific functionality in HBQT, implement 
all Xbase++ compatible functionality in HBXBP 
(with possible extensions, which are strictly 
QT/GTK/etc _independent_).

Finally we have HBIDE, which can basically use 
any functionality which is provided by HBQT 
or HBXBP, and it can mix these in any ways. 
It's a end-user application (not a library), so 
such things have no deeper consequences. 
Although as a rule, HBIDE should stay portable, 
so f.e. hbwin usage is out of question, and 
usage of Harbour core functionality is encouraged, 
even C/C++ code is better to be avoided.

There are other "shortcuts" made which are not 
terrible problems functionally, but are wrong 
decisions nevertheless, f.e. HBIDE uses 
QProcess class, where we have one such class 
already in Harbour core. It's a waste of 
energy in several ways to re-implement 
existing portable core functionality using 
vendor specific solutions. We also have now 
.xhp reading functionality in HBIDE, while 
I made efforts in the past to implement 
the same thing in hbmk2. Well, instead of 
testing/fixing hbmk2, we now have a duplicate 
implementation to maintain and fix. Efficient? 
Not entirely. [ remaining, even more grave 
problems can be looked up from mail archives. ]

Overall IMO the main problem is that in case 
of HBQT/HBXBP/HBIDE in the heat of enthusiasm 
the development path goes into a certain level 
of "featuritis" and rush, where we want everything 
at any future cost and now. IOW quantity is 
favored instead of quality. IMO we should 
not have "all" features, but only the important 
ones in order of priority, in a stable and working 
fashion.

Brgds,
Viktor

If this is the case, there is nothing wrong in asking 
these things specifically. I very often ask such 
question on the list (and not always, but sometimes 
I even get answers), and IMO this should be the 
proper way, instead of staying silent, or sweeping 
a problem under the carpet and/or introduce 
a shortcut, which will "cost" a lot more to fix 
sometimes in the future. These are possibly the 
worse actions that can be made in such cases.

Sometimes it's possible that an approach or 
solution will look right to the developer, but 
others "outside the box" will see its shortage or 
potential problem. In this case IMO it's essential 
to allow for discussion and make required corrections 
_in time_ and without taking it personally. That's 
where the power of peer review and joint development 
is.

I'm sure there is enough talent around here to help 
in most of these problems. And I believe there is 
no problem which we couldn't solve by investing some 
joint effort into it.

BTW I have a few reference counting questions pending 
in hbwin lib, and I hope to get answers to them; even 
if the answer is that even the question is silly. Could 
be, but everything is useful which will help us to 
find the ideal solution.

Brgds,
Viktor

I agree with you.

Situations like this, usually drives to a project to split between 
(allegedly) 'conservative' and 'agressive' developers.

IMHO, that is a false dichotomy.

The truth is that a development tool must be compact, stable, reliable, 
  rock-solid thing and not a technical playground.

Such playground is funny and must exist, but it should be in a different 
place.

Regards,

Roberto.

Hello Viktor

Because this is pure technical message so I am 
here to clarify some points which I think have either
been misunderstood or ( by me also, no issues )
interpreted in a wrong way.

You are right and we are sticking to the same rule.
And in the future too, no two thoughts.

I have scheduled a detailed reply to HbpQtUI issue,
but in brief I would like to suggest that just review 
the code. QUiLoader() class is just a wrapper to 
load different components of a dialog from an .xml 
file, nothing more. It essentally calls other Q* 
functions to generate the dialog. In Windows you 
can design a dialog in ant resource toolkit which 
in turn produces a .rc embeddable in the appln, 
wheras Qt offers this class to load. If you look into 
HbpQtUI() class, you will immediately recognize
that it reads .ui ( .xml ) format and then the 
QUiLoader() is called and recognized various
window components from .ui read parsing.
Also this class adheres to Xbp class modal 
convensions. If we need to put it along Qt libs,
then I have to rewrite this class adhering only 
Qt calls. Any other engine can achieve the similar
job just reading a specifically formated file or even
.ui. Even now with some extra effort I can do so 
purely on class level without calling QUiLoader().
This is not an issue at all. We have already decided
on namespace, so this class can be separated from 
hbXBP any time. For this matter we can think 
of a separate lib called hbHBP and club all such 
classes which are based on Xbp there. Xbp remains
the placeholder of only those classes which are in 
Xbase++ distribution.

If this is acceptable, it is matter of little time. But 
because I am not a make expert, so you have to 
look into the basics.

I need more explanation what is this. It is not too
late to correct if such situation exists.

I even propose to separate all such classes 
which are not Xbp specific but are fully in par with 
Xbp calling convensions. Qt specif classes which 
call Qt wrappers are under the domain of Qt only.

I tried with, and the code stayed for quiet some time,
but I could not get rid of console appearing in front 
of the IDE and hanging ther until the process finished.
Also the process output captured at the end. 
Przemek guided handsomely how other parts could be 
used but I could not get them working. Moreover
Qt's implementation gave me very fine control over
very basic points, and may by my lack of time or 
efforts, I could not achieve with hb_processRun().
I thought you will jump in to fix it. But still it is 
not too late. If someone can do so please come forward.
It should a matter of minutes.


 We also have now 
.xhp reading functionality in HBIDE, while 
I made efforts in the past to implement 
the same thing in hbmk2. Well, instead of 
testing/fixing hbmk2, we now have a duplicate 
implementation to maintain and fix. Efficient? 
Not entirely. [ remaining, even more grave 
problems can be looked up from mail archives. ]
</quite>

Again we are missing a vital point.
Visual vs Notepad. I looked in hbMK2 code 
before I wrote my parser and found it quite limited
at that point of time, which you enhanced 
later. I also needed some more info which was 
not .hbp specific. Correct me if I am missing 
something...
 
If you are saying the parsing of .xhp was unneccessary,
it could have been issued via -xhp=filename option,
then perhaps it is not the goal of hbIDE.
hbIDE is essentially a visual environment to fetch
all such information from the user in a visual
way and supply to hbMK2. And visual environment
needs sectionized and identified information, 
stored in a manner it could carry many tasks 
to make user's life easier.

Something I cannot reply to...
I cannot demarcate what you mean by essential
and what is futuristic? Some detailed analysis
may help me to understand your view point.

Qt framework is minimum basic to start 
developing anything meaningful...( raw material )

hbXBP (or any other class framework ) is 
the foundation to lay your creativity on....( backbones )

hbIDE is the final result show casing the above two...( bulding )
What got developed extra ?

To be noted point is, a human cannot pay

I got indulged in hbQT* implementation to the point 
where my wife and children got neglected. It is highly 
likely that I must have missed some posts you are 
referring to. The main problem with Qt is the 
insufficient knowldge how it handles the object 
destruction. Istvan forwarded some help 
but it seems even those are not sufficient, we need 
more hands. Rest are cosmatic affairs.

Then perhaps it is the moral duty of the visualizer
to fix them. Developer tends to go by his vision, it is normal.

Right now, no attention to Windows development

feel a few I could have resolved if paid attention to.

I'm sorry, it didn't clarify much for me :) I have great respect for anyone who 
can sacrifice their time the way you have done so. However, I do not understand 
why a technical discussion has to go in this direction.

For me, it is clear that the hierarchical nature of hbqt->xbp means that you 
should not rule out hbgtk->xbp (or hbwin->xbp etc). They are separate things for 
good reasons. Surely you can find an abstraction that allows you to proceed 
without destroying that possibility?

BMDBFCDX is still not integrated into the core because it is a poor use of the 
capabilities of an RDDs to inherit the base methods of another - DBFCDX.

In summary, I think Viktor is correct, and you are wrong about this technical 
detail, and wrong to make it such a big issue outside of technicalities.

Alex

Message-ID: <674e4ddd1001280049w53c908cfy27e01d36f32e19a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I heard that Przemek is the guru to ask about SixCDX questions from Viktor.
Well I think I have found a Clipper / Harbour incongruency.  (or maybe I'm
going about it the wrong way)... :).  In the case below, whenever I use 3
args for SX_KEYADD, and three args are present...

I have included the result, and the code.  I had to get someone else who
knew Clipper better than I did to write a Hello World-sized app to reproduce
the error.  Problem is, this never was an issue when using Clipper 5.2e.

I have found that if i just use two params instead of three, I get no
errors, (though I'm quite sure it is because something completely different
is being accomplished, that I wouldn't want).

---- The execution:

C:\hbm>hello.exe

Error DBFNTX/1052  Unknown error
Called from SX_KEYADD(0)
Called from HELLO(11)

---- My source code below:

#include "hbsix.ch"

USE DATBASE

INDEX ON SXCHAR(10) TAG "MIKEY" OF TEMP

DBGOTOP()

DO WHILE !EOF()

  IF SX_KEYADD("mikey",1,padr("mike",10))
    WAIT
  ENDIF

  DBSKIP()

ENDDO

-------

By the way, the DATBASE is an arbitrary .dbf I picked.  I picked some other
.dbf files I had handy, and the same thing occured.

Many thanks in advance.  :)

Message-ID: <674e4ddd1001280145j14a80aal1beb7b3438e0727d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I noticed the -z switch allows to stop using shortcuts for .and. and .or.
Clipper conditions.

Without -z, if I do:

eval(something) .or. .t. // will recognize that it's already true, and not
make the eval

When -z is enabled:

.f. .and. eval(something) // will try to eval 'something', despite the fact
that .f. already failed.

... If what I said is actually true, is there any sort of secondary -z
switch that can be done to make it simply not be lazy, yet fail on first
condition?

... If what I said is complete nonsense and complete BS, I will have to go
through the code I'm trying to compile that someone else wrote and see
what's up.  By the way, I realize that the above examples are not the best
way to do things... and I sure as heck wouldn't do it that way myself.  Just
trying to get some existing Clipper functioning code to behave the same way
in Harbour.

Thank you for your time.

In this example you are using DBFNTX and the code you create use
some hidden SIX3 SIXCDX feature.
In SIX3 if index expression starts with "SXCHAR(", "SXDATE(", "SXNUM("
or "SXLOG(" then it's automatically marked as TEMPLATE index which is
EMPTY. It also means that above code in Clipper does not execute SX_KEYADD()
even once because after:
   INDEX ON SXCHAR(10) TAG "MIKEY" OF TEMP
empty index is created and it's set as controlling index.
I intentionally haven't replicated this behavior in core RDD though
in SIXCDX Harbour RDD there is inactive initial code which enables it
(see src/rdd/dbfcdx/dbfcdx1[3497]). I simply do not like such hacks
(some partial key expression analyzes to create completely different
index) so in Harbour you have to explicitly use CUSTOM or EMPTY clause
in INDEX ON command to create indexes where you can manually add and
delete keys using sx_keyAdd()/sx_keyDel() or ordKeyAdd()/ordKeyDel():
   INDEX ON SXCHAR(10) TAG "MIKEY" OF TEMP EMPTY
or is you do not use hbsix.ch:
   INDEX ON SXCHAR(10) TAG "MIKEY" TO TEMP CUSTOM
otherwise above RTE is generated. 1052 is CL53 DBFCDX compatible error
when user tries to execute key add or del operation on normal non custom
index. If it's really big problem then I can change it in Harbour SIXCDX
RDD to work like SIX3 RDD (without above RTE and with automatic TEMPLATE
index attribute setting) but I cannot touch DBFCDX and other RDDs where
I would like to keep more strict behavior which is also CL53 DBFCDX/COMIX
compatible.

Exactly just like in Clipper.

It's default behavior. Just simply do not use -z or better use the same
switches as in Clipper.

You mixed two different things which confuse you:
   1. compile time optimizations
   2. lazy boolean expression evaluation

Both Harbour and Clipper support -z switch to control lazy expression
evaluation. It works in the same way. This code illustrate it:

   proc main()
      local f:=.F., t:=.T.
      ?; ?? .t. .or.  f()
      ?; ?? .f. .and. f()
      ?; ?? f() .or.  .t.
      ?; ?? f() .and. .f.
      ?
      ?; ??  t  .or.  f()
      ?; ??  f  .and. f()
      ?; ?? f() .or.   t
      ?; ?? f() .and.  f
      ?
   return
   func f()
      ?? "[F()] "
   return .T.

compile it with and without -z switch using Harbour and Clipper and
compare results. Please note that when -z is not used then first 4
expressions are optimized at compile time and next 4 ones are optimized
at runtime. Compile time optimization calculates final result and
replace the code with simple .F. or .T. so F() function is never
execute. It's also Clipper compatible behavior.
Anyhow Clipper does not optimize all expressions (i.e. it does not
optimize <exp> if message is send to it: <exp>:msg()) and cannot strip
parenthesis in optimization process. Harbour does not make any exceptions
here and optimize all end everywhere if it's possible what seems to be
correct behavior. You can add these lines to above test to see the
difference:

   ?; ?? (.t.) .or.  f()
   ?; ?? (.f.) .and. f()
   ?; ?? f() .or.  (.t.)
   ?; ?? f() .and. (.f.)
   ?
   ?; ?? ( .t. .or.  f() ):classname
   ?; ?? ( .f. .and. f() ):classname
   ?; ?? ( f() .or.  .t. ):classname
   ?; ?? ( f() .and. .f. ):classname
   ?

compile it without -z switch and compare Clipper and Harbour results.
If you want to replicate also this Clipper behavior then you can use
-kc switch which disables all Harbour extensions though I cannot promise
that we located all places were Clipper does not make compile time
optimization and added necessary protection for -kc switch. If you will
find sth then please inform us. We try to cover it by -kc switch or
document the difference. Such missing optimizations in chosen places
for me are bugs which should be eliminated to not create some hidden
and not understandable for users exception so I've never tried to make
precise test to detect all such Clipper anomalies.
If you want to read more about compile time optimizations then read
docs/cmpopt.txt

Hi Przemys?aw,

I appreciate the answer.  I don't like hacks either, as I have found some
other hacks that I've had to try to work around.  I wrote the EMPTY thing
(as we do use the .ch file) and it solved the problem!  So thanks for that.
As far as the question of if you want to implement SIX3 defaults... you
would know a lot better than I would if it's a good idea.  I will say one
thing though, it will help Clipper programmers who have had a hard time
getting SIX3 to work back 10 years ago and have stumbled upon it "just
working" back then...

Since Harbour seems to be 100% Clipper compliant, I would think it would be
a good idea.  But then again, I don't like hacks either :(  So it is really
your call.

One last question though, if I may.  How often do I have to worry about this
EMPTY / CUSTOM addition?  Is it just whenever I want to use sx_keyadd?  Or
are there other pitfalls I should look out for.

Thanks for your quick answer!

I tend to agree to enable this (really not very good looking) 
hack in SIXCDX to make it more compatible. This way anyone 
can use it for initial port without modifying code, then can 
clean in a separate step and switch to hack-free DBFCDX.

Just a thought.

Brgds,
Viktor

OK, I'll make such modifications soon.

Thanks for the reply.

As far as I can tell, I have found a difference in Clipper and Harbour in
terms of these evaluations.  But as I said earlier, I could be completely
mistaken.  I have done a lot of little tests to check the -z flag but
unfortunately I'm not that good at Clipper as one of my friends is.  (I'm
better at Perl, etc).  But if I can demonstrate the problem in a small Hello
World type example, I will post it, to try to figure out what is happening,
with your help.  :)  The only reason I bring this up, is because I am trying
to compile an old DOS16 app and it is behaving differently on these .or.
lines.

Thanks again for reading!!!  I have read your informative reply, and will
test what you said out for myself to try to figure out what is going on.

Thank you Przemek.  When it is done, could you please post in this thread?
I suppose then, I would have to figure out how to get this incorporated with
the 2.0.0 version of Harbour I am using now on Windows.

*many thanks*

I don't like the idea of using hacks to emulate erratic behavior

I understand that, but .xml is just the container 
format, what really matters is the content and the 
specification which describes this content. In this 
case the content of the .ui file is seemingly a 
QT specific implementation of UI element description, 
with QT specific rules to describe UI elements, 
positions, string and visual behavior. We may not 
even know some parts of it which may be used in final 
Harbour apps, so to switch to GTK someone will need to 
create a _complete QT compatible parser for the .ui format_.
Moreover it may be that GTK, WX or other GUI have their 
own similar formats already, and in this case such 
emulated QT version will even look alien there. So IOW 
IMO it's not a good idea to adopt QT-specific .ui 
format as _the_ portable format for HBXBP.

F.e. current .ui file have such line:
   <widget class="QDialog" name="ProjectProperties">

I can't see how that can be made to look/work portable 
and QT independent. It has the QT class name in it.

So, the clean solution here is either to create a 
HBXBP specific file format, which implements a portable 
way of describing UI elements, OR (and this is definitely 
the easiest) to implement such class in HBQT.

I can understand that. Well, I'm not sure if it 
helps our case to introduce a 4th contrib for QT 
to address QT - XBP specific needs, so if such 
issues are too pressing, maybe we should 
simply drop original ideas and rename HBXBP to 
HBQTXBP, which allows you to add HBPQT* classes. 
This of course means that HBXBP won't live up 
to original promise to be a generic Xbase++ 
class implementation, which can either mean the 
original idea was over-optimistic and such thing 
can't exist (possible), or it can mean it would 
require a too complicated layout not usable in 
practice, or over our capacity.

As a workaround such QT-XBP connector functionality 
can be contained inside HBIDE, but in this case 
end-users will have to add this same hack to their 
own app.

Maybe some other GUI gurus could add some more 
ideas to solve that.

I was thinking about HBDBFMODEL and HBQTABLEVIEW.
Where it seems that some more fine grained layering 
could be used to keep HBQT on the generic side and 
implement exact HBXBP needs as .prg level class/functions 
in HBXBP.

The naming is perfectly right. But, in HBXBP there 
should be no such names. For reasons outlined many 
times. Just think what happens if we want to implement 
HBXBPGTK once in the future.

Yes. We have one .c module, maybe that could be 
replaced with some sort of generic .c function, 
but that's not huge or priority issue for now.

I'd be glad to see the exact problems you were 
having with HB_PROCESS*(), possibly with a small 
and up to the point example. I'm sure that by addressing 
those we may be able to either give better guidelines 
on using this Harbour API, or make appropriate enhancements 
in core to address the issues.

For the first one: I wrote a msg asking "to 
hold on for while", because I needed some time 
to enhance it, which I did. As for the rest I'd 
need to know what exactly do you need which is 
missing from hbmk2, maybe it can be added in some 
ways. If you needed the %HOME%-like variables, 
I can convert them to {HOME} macros. But I need 
to know which are these exactly.

I can see it, but reusing our own code is 
essential. There are other ways like moving  
these conversions into a lib, anyhow I can't 
see what's wrong in calling an external utility 
for some rare, one-time functionality. Tools 
do that all the time. If the popping up window 
is an issue, we should solve that.

HBQT is fine in this respect (though QProcess is certainly 
not needed), but it still have the problems, see the 
TOFIXes in main lib, there is still a shortcut about 
the :pPtr issue (you told it's too much work to change it), 
which is now solved with a low-level hack, there is 
the crash when exiting, there is the slots/events potential 
leaks by requiring precis high level management. Plus 
it's still has places where leaks or GPFs are possible.
Plus: MT issues. These are the known ones.

Here I can see a certain level of what I described.
I think it needs much more testing against original 
Xbase++ and fixing existing problems before starting 
to pump even more code into it.

> hbIDE is the final result show casing the above two...( bulding )
> What got developed extra ? 

Here I find the priorities mixed. F.e. until an app 
crashes on exit every time, I simply couldn't find it 
justified to add theme support or similar things. For 
me even a simple build didn't work until I added the hbmk2 
dir solution. Here I cannot help without big time 
investment, but as a general idea: Make it usable and 
complete first for basic cases, then extend it with 
"bells and whistles". My general impression is that 
even HBIDE basic features have things lacking, and the 
UI looks casual and it's not getting fixed. F.e. look 
at how the menu gets greyed and stays that way when 
opening a dialog and closing it, strange focusing issues 
on the project pane, etc. Maybe these are HBQT or HBXBP 
problems, but not addressing these tells to me that we're 
rushing forward without fixing things behind.

Viktor

It looks like I'm going to have to wait till my boss wakes up.  I can't for
the life of me figure out how to make an .EXE from an .OBJ from Clipper.
Why couldn't they just make this easy, like hbmk2?  *huge anger at software
makers*.  Oh well.  I will have to wait about 3 hours until my boss comes to
work... another sleepless night.

I'm just a Harbour user.

I've expressed my opinions from there, briefly and respectfully.

There was no intentions to make it personal.

I hope that you understand this.

Regarding code, it is already done: xhGTK 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/xhgtk/).

Maybe, not entirely, but it could be an excellent starting point for a 
fast, compact, multi-platform GUI (core) support for Harbour.

Roberto.

SIX3 RDDs are not Clipper part. I know that they are very popular and
I also have SIX3.02 package but when I begin to make deeper tests with
this library I've found such many serious bugs that in my opinion it
was never fully production ready. Buffer overflows, memory corruptions,
index file corruption, memo and data file corruptions, wrongly updated
index files, problems with accessing some valid indexes files, etc.
I can understand that someone make a mistake and the code should be
fixed but in few cases they intentionally introduced hacks which cannot
work and _HAVE_ to give wrong results and this causes that I stop to
trust Successware and their products. This code quite well illustrate it:

   request SIXCDX
   proc main()
     field FINT
     rddSetDefault( "SIXCDX" )
     dbcreate( "_tst", { { "FINT", "V", 4, 0 } } )
     use _tst
     dbappend()
     FINT := 538976287; ? FINT
     FINT := 538976288; ? FINT
     FINT := 538976289; ? FINT
   return

This code compiled by Clipper and linked with SIX3 SIXCDX RDD shows:
   538976287
           0
   538976289
Funny isn't it?
What is amazing in 538976288 number that it cannot be stored in V4
fields giving 0 as result?
Its binary representation is equal to space(4) and spaces are used
as default initialization value in DBF record. It means that someone
hacked in SIX3 code that exactly this value (538976288) when read from
DBF record is translated to 0. He had to know that such hack breaks
this field usage and it's a bug which can cause very serious problems
for users. But it is very hard to locate such bug for normal users who
do not know what should be tested so it was not creating SIX3 selling
problems and was accepted in the final product. Maybe they didn't have
wrong motivation but in my opinion such things should never happen.

Some anomalies which are not critical I replicated in SIXCDX and HBSIX
library but for sure I cannot replicate hacks like above only to be
bug compatible. In case of Clipper I usually try to document all anomalies
but there are too much problems with SIX3 library to address all of them
so it would be waste of time.

It should be add only to INDEX ON command which create index with key
expression starting with "sxChar(", "sxNum(", "sxDate(" or "sxLog(".
That's all.

You should definitely not neglect other things, since 
we should never forget the fun part and that we do 
Harbour because it gives us something. But it's fully up 
to you how to balance. If it starts to ruin other things, 
just stop. Never anybody called for a deadline or asked 
for anything to be there now and never will (or simply 
turn it down if anything like that happens.)

It's also about priorities: IMO development is not 
just pouring new code. It's about stabilizing what 
we have. It may be less fun at times, but only this 
way anything can become a serious product at the end. 
So in Harbour we tend to prioritize bug fixes over 
adding new features. IOW there is no point in having 
any feature rich product with a lose base and bugs 
lurking.

Overall for me the only important thing is that we're 
on the right (agreed) track and speak on the same terms.

You could notice that I've fixed quite some things, 
but it's certainly not my duty to fix everything 
I happen to notice. Besides not my (or testers') duty, 
it's many times not possible, since a tester/reviewer 
doesn't also know what's the proper way, but can 
only tell that's something is wrong (this scenario 
happens when we get a bug report from user f.e.).
HBQT is only one contrib, and we have lots of other 
things in Harbour to take care of. Plus its size is 
huge. And since you're the "father" of these components, 
you have to show care also when things are rough and 
problems are found. This is part of development.

Also for me it _has_ been though but I went and 
fixed all reported hbmk2 issues to make it good and 
accepted. Believe me it was though sometimes to read 
15 bullet points and get to the end of each of them, 
and reiterate, but it's worth it. In fact you can 
be grateful to anyone giving any sort of valuable 
feedback, it means that they care.

It's actually not Windows dependent matter at 
all, it's the same problem-set as in HBQT: How to 
handle the case when we assign GC collected pointers 
to low-level structures. How to ensure the object 
won't be freed by GC until it's used by low level 
structure? How to make sure it's getting released 
when it's not used anymore?

Viktor

Wow, great answer.  Maybe I should stop using SIX3 entirely.  Any other
Harbour compatible database formats you would recommend for the transition,
to avoid all these bugs?  Hopefully it isn't hard to convert SIX3 to
whatever you suggest.  If I can keep using a file-based database instead of
having to connect to a Mysql server for example, that would obviously be
more convenient for what I am doing.

I changed:
        index on sxChar(11) tag "Keyword" of (fTemp)
To:
        index on sxChar(11) tag "Keyword" of (fTemp) EMPTY

... and the problem doesn't come back! :)   I tried to follow your
instructions as best I could.  Did I do it correctly?  (I just want to
double check)

Thank you!!!  By the way, you really know your stuff about Clipper!

Very good!
all feature set are present

-The idea or select one or more project must be applied also to make process
search in current is not selected more selected project in project

not return find value in another location)

Follow a strange request that you can ignore
For help same user to undestrand hbide, and also help you, can you

We as humans sometimes react otherwise but without

I got it.
This is exactly I do not have a solution to.
Lower level referencing is a must in certain situations.
Unless the reverse call to the function, which has 
assigned it, is made it is not easy to free it.
In hbQT there are two places where it is like this -
hbqt_hbevents and hbqt_hbslots.cpp.
I am upgrading this issue on my priority list.

If this was meant for me:
   hbmk2 project1.hbp project2.hbp

hbmk2 doesn't handle project trees and project 
interdependencies at the moment, so that part needs 
to be sorted out by caller application and 
a list of projects in proper sequence fed to hbmk2 
(like above).

If someone passed me an algorithm which creates 
such sorted sequence out of a dependency tree, I 
may implement this in hbmk2.

What I mean:
   SOLUTION_A
      PROJECT_1
         depends on: PROJECT_3
      PROJECT_2
      PROJECT_3
      PROJECT_4
         depends on: PROJECT_1, PROJECT_2
=>
  hbmk2 project_3.hbp project_1.hbp project_2.hbp project_4.hbp 

(circular dependencies also have to be detected)

Brgds,
Viktor

hbXBP remains as is and I am transferring hbpQtUI to hbQT.

This is essentially a Qt specific. There was no other way 
to receive protected events. One idea could be that 
parent class ( in this case QAbstractModelView and QTableView )
are constructed from hbqt_* classes and delete separate 
classes. But in certain situations this is not possible.
The constucture is designed with Harbour specific 
parameters. Ideas are welcome...

Already agreed.

This .c module is plain string parser on Harbour levels.
Any other implementation can adopt it, no ?

First and foremost, how we can disable console appearnce?
The secon - how we can capture the output in real time?

Till then I had already done.
Also note that at the point I ask user to feed in 
an .xhb or .hbp I do not want to call hbMK2.
The make engine is called on build process.

You must have seen I retained the exact same 
code you sent for .hbp. I can replace my parser
with yours it it helps any way.

No, I need an array to be returned with different 
components as you provided in .hbp code. 
%HOME% in xMate always points to resident folder
of .xhp and it is already retrived. 
Again I have to host this code in hbIDE instead
of calling hbMK2 at this point.

MT issue: I will turn to it later. I could not resolve the
painting issue of Qt in MT scenario. 
For the rest I am aware of but probably there 
could be any way to eleiminate that altogether.
The problem is : subsytem cannot recognize which object 
is firing this event. I will give it a thought again...

Testing comes along the way.
Angel has forwarded some issues which I resolved.
Rest will be resolved as these are known. Currenly 
all concentration is on hbIDE.

I know your view points. And I always look into the
points. Sometimes I can get to it, sometimes at some 
later time. It is all about developing an application.
Features comes like a flow and you cannot resist it.
If you look into the commits, everytime some aspects
are reworked. This is a normal process in this direction.
This is why I stalled Vailton's contributions for some time.

If this was meant for me:
   hbmk2 project1.hbp project2.hbp
</quote?

This is Massimo's idea I jotted down here in this thread.
His request is for hbIDE. As far as I remember hbMK2 
already builds multiple projects - without cirricular 
dependancies, right ?

This window will be expanded after results are obtained.
Otherwise it will remain hidden.

What exactly do you want to know?
It is a Dialog designed in Qt Creator, and Qt Creator
created this .ui file. I did nothing with this file itself.
HbpQtUI() class is responsible to present it on the 
screen. What else ?

Thank you. It's good. Pls make sure that this 
class won't contain anything XBP specific, f.e. 
it cannot inherit from xbpWindow. So some slight 
changes will be needed, f.e. to receive a QT 
window object as parameter.

Not knowing the gory details I can't help here.
IMO it's enough to make sure that these classes 
are useful in general, not just for XBP and they 
contain no XBP specific specialities.

It's a special string parser tailored for .prg 
source lines, used in (AFAICS) speed critical 
code. Here the only solution is to reimplement 
it from Harbour core parts if possible, anyway 
it's the "cherry on top" category, so let's just 
forget this one for now.

After checking the matter a little more closely

I hope Przemek can jump in, though I remember him 
answering this exact question once in the past.

It would be useful to dig up this message.

I remember to implement WAPI_WAITFOR*() functions in hbwin 
after reading this conversation to help the matter, though 
we would need some portable core solution for this problem, 
also.

What is the reason? With it you could also easily 
load hbmake and .xbp files with minimal extra 
work. [ we need to solve the popping window though. ]

[ It's pretty easy to do, you copy the source filename 
to a temp file, call hbmk2 with one parameter, pick the 
same temp file but with .hbp extension and load it 
as it as a regular .hbp file. ]

If you want to maintain a copy of it and update it, 
it's better but still not overly beautiful. I certainly 
can't dedicate attention to update hbmk2.prg copy 
in case the code changes in hbide.

I don't understand it. All you'd need to do is 
converting .xhp to pure .hbp file and use the standard 
.hbp loader (which I've posted and which you've since 
implemented) on it to load it. This way it's modular and 
clean.

Yes, it can build a flat list of multiple projects in 
supplied (left to right) order.

My understanding is that some IDEs will keep track of 
what depends on what in multicomponent projects 
("solutions") and will invoke component build processes 
in proper bottom to top order to satisfy all dependencies.

Brgds,
Viktor

For sure not. hbQT does not know anything about hbXBP.

These are general in nature. But I am not sure any 
other implementation will need such functionality, if 
the subsystem of undelying GUI provides for.

In general, these classes are "sub-classed" objects where 
usually "protected" methods are made public.
HBTableView() class accespts a code block as constructor
which is not Qt specific. Any other implementation will be 
achieving the same goal differently, who knows.

Yep, this can be achieved with already contained 
code in hbIDE but here speed is the concern. I will see 
how it can be changed, but priority is low.

I mensioned that I made some experiments, though 
not for a longer duration, and could not achieve something 
similar as Qt provides. Even if it has be implemented, it 
needs MT support as the output will ever be read in 
different thread [ read Przemek's explanation ].
So, for the time being we can put this issue aside.
Later in some spare time we can think of hb_process*
functionality and can design a class framework.

No problems, I will maintain in hbIDE. 
As already explained, I do not want to call any 
external process at the moment of "New Project"

So we put it aside again :(

I hope Przemek can add some input, because I 
don't feel hbide usage pattern is so special, 
that our core API should not handle it.

It's not really "new project", but "import project", 
should happen rarely, unless you plan to implement 
write support for all these alien formats, but I believe 
this isn't the plan.

Ups, number of messages in last days I should read carefully is still
growing up and I have limited time :-(
If you think it will make things simpler and easier to update
then please change it. We will use the same macros as in mainwin.c
code.

No problem at all, I just committed an optimized version, 
It should work with both versions.

I can understand the entries like 
   Block 4 0x1203df0 (size 4) QT_QUILOADER(0), "289A3D00"
but cannot grab why these are there as recurring :
   Block 5 0x11f1158 (size 8) QT_QUILOADER_LOAD(0), "06000000C0E02701"
almost the size of controls in a dialog loaded with HbpQtUI() class.

The puzzle is that QT_QUILOADER_LOAD() is called _ONCE_ only for any dialog.
But the fm stats show otherwise - 14 for FindReplace dialog.

I have checked and recched many times if I am calling this function
multiple times by placing debug info in Qt_QUILOADER_LOAD() function itself
and receive that it is called only once per dialog. I do not know what is 
the issue.

Can you compile Harbour with -DHB_FM_STATISTICS and run hbIDE to confirm
this phenomena to make me sure I have not any other setup on my machine ?

Also I am receiving in this log, all the objects created with new()
which are got freed ( I can visualize ) before RETURN is reached in main().

Any help is appreciated.

DBI_ENCRYPT/DBI_DECRYPT encrypt/decrypt whole table but they have
protection against multiple calls so they do not encrypt already
encrypted table and do not decrypt already decrypted table.
They return table encryption status (the same value as DBI_ISENCRYPTED).
Your results confirms such behavior.

If you want to change password then you have to decrypt the table
and then encrypt it again with new password.

The above log does not mean that QT_QUILOADER_LOAD() was called more then
once. It only means that inside this function or some deeper functions
called from it few memory blocks were allocated and never released.

No it does not show anything like that. It only shows that more then one
memory block was allocated by this function but you do not have any
information about number of QT_QUILOADER_LOAD() calls.

So sth bound with this object was not released. Maybe some of its components
needs explicit release call. I can only guess.

I'm not a good index locking and dbfcdx driver internals guru, but new 
code looks like a little buggy.

dbfcdx1.c line 8414 has
   hb_cdxIndexLockWrite( pTag->pIndex );
but line 8437
   hb_cdxIndexUnLockWrite( pTag->pIndex );
is protected by line 8434
   if( pKey )

I guess if pKey == NULL index remains locked!


The same for lines 8465 and 8496.

Thank you.

Just one comment: The name of the class should be HBQUILOADER() 
(or HBQUI()) to be in sync with rest of classes. HBP*() namespace 
is reserved for HBXBP lib.

This class deals with loading UI object descriptions from 
disk and creates them in memory by making one QT call. So 
it's almost unlikely that these objects are created using 
HBQT GC allocator functions, but rather raw C++ memory 
allocations calls.

BTW, I see such calls in many QT related calls in SVN:
      qObj:pPtr := 0
      qObj:pPtr := NIL

These can be optimized simply to:
      qObj:pPtr := NIL

Viktor

Did you compiled hbQT, hbXBP also?
If not build them clean.

Perfect explanation.
Now I know that any reserved memory blocks within a function call
are reported as many times in fm log. Because QT_QUILOADER_LOAD() 
function issues only a single call to Qt's librray as such:

/*
 * QWidget * load ( QIODevice * device, QWidget * parentWidget = 0 )
 */
HB_FUNC( QT_QUILOADER_LOAD )
{
   hb_retptrGC( hbqt_gcAllocate_QWidget( hbqt_par_QUiLoader( 1 )->load(
hbqt_par_QIODevice( 2 ), hbqt_par_QWidget( 3 ) ), false ) );
}

so my understanding is that Qt is directing mem alloc/release call to c++
stub 
injected by hbMK2. Is this right ? Otherwise how fm stats could record how
many 
blocks are allocated.

No, I have information about how many calls to QT_QUILOADER_LOAD() - 1.

Exactly. But what ? I am struggling to find out.

As I remember few weeks before /hbXBP/tests/demoxbp.exe 
was showing a clean log, and now it shows up with huge list of 
unreleased blocks. What I presume that after c++ stub introduced,
it actually showed up real problem in Qt which we are struggling so far.

Any other input leading to solve this myth will be useful.

I used this method to release object instantly.
This approach I took was since begining. My be my experiments
at that point with Qt were showing that until I set the :pPtr to 
some other value ( not NIL ) only then I could see object relaesed.
NIL was delaying them for some later time, may be due to GC nature.
So I continued with it.

I may be wrong, if yes, I will clean-up above code.
It is always a pain to free it in two calls.

Yes, these are shown because of the hbmk2 C++ stub, 
before the addition of it, basically no tests were 
accurate since the allocation functions were never 
overridden.

Yes it is. Now also memory allocated by NEW operator is recorded by FM stat
so all objects created with NEW and never DELETEd are reported as unreleased
memory blocks.
Before that modification they were reported only by external programs like
valgrind. Few times valgrind logs were send to this list and they contain
visually similar list of unreleased blocks.

If you were right, we'd have serious problems in 
our GC core collector, not just in HBQT but in any 
.prg level apps using the same method (quite some).

I'd be very surprised though if we had such basic 
problem in core.

If you don't believe me, it's best if you ask Przemek 
for the final verdict.

There is not differnce for GC id you make
   x := 1
   x := NIL
or
   x := NIL
or
   x := 1
   x := NIL
   x := .F.
or
   ...
in all cases only the 1-st assignment is significant.

It may also imply that Qt is taking two approaches,
for alloc the standard C++ way and for releases some 
proprietory method not directing to our stub call.

Again I may be utterly wrong.

To streamline what is happening behind the curtain, can 
you show me a way how hbMK2 can be directed not to use
c++ stub itself but under project control. I want to put some 
debug info here and there.

For me it sounds like some hacks are implemented in HBQT to accept 
numeric values instead of pointers, thus leading numeric 0 value have 
different behaviour than NIL value.

If value of qObj:nPtr is GC pointer, both qObj:pPtr := 0 and qObj:pPtr 
:= NIL will release it (no need to do it twice). Or we have a serious 
bug in GC, but I guess we do not have one. If you have a situation when 
double clear is required, please, try to isolate the error and reproduce 
it in a small self-contained sample.

It would be a quite stupid thing on their part.

What's theoretically possible is that we're not 
overriding some delete operators. Though I took 
the C++ allocation override information right from 
the QT documentation available on the web, but 
it's possible it's outdated.

Yes, it's documented option of hbmk2:
   -nohbcppmm

You can even customize the stub, dump it with -debugstub 
option, modify it and link it to the project while using 
above function.

Hello ppl of Harbour;

I don't follow regurarly the ML, but, in an "ego surfing" session, I 
found this message from April White from last october:

""""

Hello  Giancarlo,

I'm working on the hbdoc2 program and I saw that the INET documentation 
is in the harbour/doc folder not harbour/doc/en-en folder.  Additionally 
I've found that there are other functions in hbinet.c not listed in the 
text file.

With your permission, I would like to:

- make a (new) harbour/doc/en-en/hbinet.txt file using the text from 
your inet.txt
- add a copyright entry for you
- add missing functions to this file, adding parameters and return 
values as I can get from hbinet.c
- remove the use of "xHarbour", leaving the sentance(s) as "the program"

Sure thing lad, permission granted, and sorry for the late reply. 
However, a search on the web for my name leads directly to my site, where you can
then mail directly to me.

I reckon this could only be true if :pPtr would not be simple DATA 
but some SETGET method. But it's DATA (declared in hbqt_misc.prg).

It is very vague this name? Perhaps include the term "Loader" or

Probably, it is scheduled to be deleted at all.
Working on something portable, hopefully I will succeed.
QtUiTools components consumes a wopping 30 mb of 
memory over and above the normal appl loading,
a huge amount. I need to get rid of this.

Hi!

Qt has an application (uic) to generate one CPP from the one UI... I
believe that a viable solution would have something to import a hbIDE
the UI and generate a PRG or we build an "hbqtuic" to obtain one PRG
from a UI file.

What do you think?

Vailton Renato

It could be serialized object saved to file (.hbv?), 
or pre-compiled .hrb file, or even plain .prg 
compiled on the fly.

Both can probably be solved with reasonable amount 
work without the need to invent a new file format, and 
if you want to keep the UI designer of QT, there 
can be an .ui to .hrb/.prg/.hbv converter utility.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi All,


these lines (and similar ones) in contrib\hbtpathy\telepath.prg
will cause in to wait 24 hours if executed before midnight.



   nDone := Seconds() + iif( nTimeout >= 0, nTimeout, 0 )

   DO WHILE tp_OutFree( nPort ) > 0 .AND. ;
         ( nTimeout < 0 .OR. Seconds() < nDone )
      hb_IdleState()
   ENDDO

how can this be fixed?
any ideas?

thanks,

Before midnight "Seconds() < nDone" will be false in this case.

Maybe (untested):

... nDone := (Seconds() + iif( nTimeout >= 0, nTimeout, 0 ) )
...
... Seconds() + iif( nDone > MS_PERDAY, MS_PERDAY, 0) < nDone

For such usage we have hb_milliSeconds() functions which returns
UTC time (if OS supports UTC time offset) in milliseconds which is
not reset at midnight, i.e. example I sent today to this list:

   proc main()
      cls
      hb_idleAdd( {||
                     static s_timer := 0
                     local timer := hb_milliseconds()
                     if timer - s_timer > 1000
                        s_timer := timer
                        hb_dispoutat( 0, 72, time() )
                     endif
                     return nil
                  } )
      wait
   return

Ops it cannot be .prg because this would need inclusion 
of compiler lib in final applications. Anyhow the other 
are still options.

Thank you Przemek, I've reimplemented it this way.

BTW, I didn't see this msg on the list. I suspect 
it was TP_ONTIME() related.

Subject: [Harbour] undefined reference to 'hb_stack'
Message-ID: <FF5395771D224208AFAADB60A65D51BC@NoteLeo>

Hi
Attempting to build a program with the function below I receive the following linkage error message:
undefined reference to `hb_stack'
The error is related to hb_retnint and hb_retni calls, because when I ommit them the error message goes away.
What is wrong with the code please?

Thank you
Leandro

code (aseek.c)

#include "hbvmopt.h" 
#include "hbapi.h"

#include "hbapiitm.h"

#include "hbvm.h"

#include "hbstack.h"




ULONG hb_arraySeek( PHB_ITEM pArray, PHB_ITEM pValue, PHB_ITEM pBlock, BOOL bSoft , BOOL bExact, PHB_ITEM pMode );  



HB_FUNC( ASEEK )

{

    PHB_ITEM pArray = hb_param( 1, HB_IT_ARRAY );

    PHB_ITEM pValue = hb_param( 2, HB_IT_ANY );

    PHB_ITEM pBlock = hb_param( 3, HB_IT_ANY );


    if( pArray && pValue )

    {

        BOOL bSoft = HB_ISLOG( 4 ) ? hb_parl ( 4 ): FALSE;

        BOOL bExact = HB_ISLOG( 5 ) ? hb_parl ( 5 ): FALSE;

        hb_retnint( hb_arraySeek( pArray, pValue, pBlock, bSoft, bExact ,pMode ) );

    }

    else

        hb_retni( 0 );

Just delete '#include "hbvmopt.h"', it's an internal header, not needed.

Hello All,

What I did

Pulled code from hbMK2 and placed along hbIDE files

                                     GPF

==============================================

The above clubs a life cycle of a Qt objects's creation to destruction.

Note this section:


            if ( p->ph )
            {
HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ( "YES_rel_HBQPlainTextEdit           ph=%p
-------------0", p->ph ) );
               delete( p->ph );
HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ( "YES_rel_HBQPlainTextEdit           ph=%p
-------------1", p->ph ) );
            }
            //p->ph = NULL;


If I follow already used method => p->ph = NULL;
then last section :

 cppstub.cpp:54: HB_TR_ALWAYS        void operator delete( void * 0x38ace78
0)
 cppstub.cpp:54: HB_TR_ALWAYS        void operator delete( void * 0x124e988
0)
 cppstub.cpp:56: HB_TR_ALWAYS               void operator delete( void *
0x124e988 1)
 ...
 ...

is never reached, fm logs points to unreleased memory block ( 1 only ).

But when is call => delete( p->ph ) then the above pointers are freed 
but at the point when I expect end of this pointer:

 cppstub.cpp:54: HB_TR_ALWAYS        void operator delete( void * 0x38ace78
0)

which is p->ph itself I get GPF. It is valid because 
    delete ( ( HBQPlainTextEdit * ) p->ph );
has already been issued.

The point to consider deep is : the pointers being freed after 2nd delete
are 
actually obtained when new HBQPlaintTextedit() was called. But how come a 
pointer is triggering the other pointers to be freed when it itself has
already been
freed.

I am unable to consolidate myself an above phenomena. But for sure this is 
EXACTLY what is consuming memory as pointers contained within pointers were 
never being released.

Hope you can pin-point the issue.

Pritpal,

I'm going to try extented FM Stats with something like this .-

HB_TRFM( char *pPtr = (char *)hb_xgrab( size ) );

or .-

HB_TRFM( pObj = ( QTextDecoder* ) new QTextDecoder( hbqt_par_QTextCodec( 1 ) ) );

In order to have in hb_out.log for HB_FM_STATISTICS .-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
Total memory allocated: 234123 bytes (4176 block(s))
Warning, memory allocated but not released: 1020 bytes (2 block(s))
Block 1 0xd88970 (size 200) MYFUNCTION(256), "200F200F ..."
myfile.c:256 [ char *pPtr = (char *)hb_xgrab( size ) ]
Block 2 0xe4a990 (size 200) QT_QTEXTDECODER(129), "200F200F ..."
qtcore.cpp:129 [ pObj = ( QTextDecoder* ) new QTextDecoder( hbqt_par_QTextCodec( 1 ) ) ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think with this FM Stats do it more human-readable, at least for me I find it useful.
I hope it can help you.

Best regards,

I am certanly poor in string handelling, especially formatting, on c++
levels.
So I have to rely on what is shown in the sources. Only point it lacks is
giving
equal size to arguments. Now it cannot be analyzed as a data, but
description only.

Hi Harbour developers,

I want to ask for var2str(...) and str2var(...) pairs functions (something
that in Xbase++) for harbour 

Or does it already there in harbour ?

Please point me in right direction ...

Hi Harbour Developer,

I am sorry, .... I have made the mistake ...

the functions pair which I needed should be as follow:

var2bin(...)  and bin2var(...) .... (like in Xbase++ )

Message-ID: <674e4ddd1001300119h4d38de75o3b5fb5d6892b52dc@mail.gmail.com>

It appears the FILEATTR() function doesn't work.

According to http://www.ousob.com/ng/tools1-3/ng935ab.php , it says it
should return a bit-wise decimal number.  I tried a few different ways...
absolute path, relative, and a piece of code my brother found from the
Harbour source files.

___Pre-test:

C:\hbm>attrib hello.prg
A   H        C:\hbm\hello.prg

___Result:

C:\hbm>hello.exe

         0
         0
         0

___code

FUNCTION main()

  ? FILEATTR("hello.prg")
  ? FILEATTR("C:\hbm\hello.prg")

cFile  :=  FILESEEK("hello.prg")
DO WHILE .NOT. EMPTY (cFile)
  ? cFile, FILEATTR()
  cFile  :=  FILESEEK()
ENDDO

return
// end


Have I found a bug? :3

   cData := hb_serialize( xData )
   [...]
   xData := hb_deserialize( cData )

If you need human readbale form for serialized data then you can use

   cExp := hb_valToExp( xData )
   [...]
   xData := &cExp

but it's much slower needs more memory and does not support all extensions
whichb exists in hb_serialize()/hb_deserialize()

Clipper tools possible bug, KSETNUM.

The syntax says:  KSETNUM ([<lNewSwitch>]) -> lOldSwitch

But what really happens, is that ? KSETNUM(.T.) prints whether or not
NUMLOCK is on or not, using .T. / .F..  It doesn't actually change Numlock,
as the SYNOPSIS says it does.

Hi,

Aside from the bug, I suggest to use Harbour core functions 
wherever they exist, in this case they are HB_FGETATTR() and 
HB_FSETATTR(). There is also HB_FGETDATETIME(), HB_FSETDATETIME().

There is also HB_FSIZE(), etc.

Many time these are documented in ChangeLog.

Brgds,
Viktor

Oh... the only reason I kept using these functions was because Norton Guides
lists them so nicely...

I will try to look through ChangeLog, but I have found that it is quite
difficult to grab functions from there, as it is not presented in a nice
list.  But I will give it a shot.

Thanks

Yes, Thank you very much for the information.
The problem is only in MS-Windows builds and it's caused by wrongly
written emulation of DOS volume label attribute in hb_fsFindFirst()/
hb_fsFindNext().
Additionally as I can see it's partially hacked in DIRECTORY() function
so I cannot fix it immediately. I'll fix it later.
Anyhow in current code we can remove yet another hack from FILEATTR()
implementation which also resolve the problem.

best regards,

Hi all,

is in Harbour docs an ordered list of Harbour extensions/substitute Clipper functions ? 

I searched among the various document but I haven't found anything. Maybe I haven't searched deeply...

Furthermore, in the doc files the documentation of each function is not described in depth: many times it's not enough to learn its use and also some code snippet is missing. To find informations in changelog can be a solution but, like in these days, functions and functionality change very quickly and it's hard to find useful informations this way. I know that it's not easy to write a proper documentation and it's precious time that a developer can't spend, but who can document the use of a function/class/project, if not the developer itself?

Sometimes in the past I used C# (for very very very little time) and by using a triple slash /// I could document each code that I was writing. The C# IDE parsed each file in search of those tags and when we needed help over a particular function, It showed us the informations that we put after those tags. 

Perhaps, we could use the same construct to help us to make a better auto-documentation. It may be used in any part of Harobur code, .c, .prg and other files (not only in the header) and it's not so far the // that a Clipper programmer is used to use in its code.

 

Best regards,

Marco

Shoving every task to the developers doesn't scale very well, 
they have finite time like everyone else. Moreover developers 
are in many cases not the best or ideal documentation writers. 
The two tasks require quite a different skill set.

This has been discussed a lot on this list, and it's really 
not a technical problem, it simply needs contributors, 
willing to give something (in this case documentation writing) 
back to the project they're getting for free.

Subject: [Harbour] Append From SDF|DELIMITED problem
Message-ID: <009901caa1b7$d93f4590$0a01fea9@VitoMobileHP>

Hi,

Recently I have found the problem trying to import some SDF/Delimited files.
My program is working compiled with Clipper, but not working compiled with Harbour...

Environment:
Harbour rev. 13584
Local computer: WinXP SP2 / SP3
(Problematic File): created on nix system, arround 200 MB, containing 5.000.000 rows 

With Clipper Exe Appending work, as Clipper treat LF or CRLF as EOL
With Harbour, as I'm running on Win system LF is not treated as EOL, And I only get one (1) record in DBF :(

Examinig some sources it looks like both appending and copying SDF (Delimited)  resides on hb_SetGetEol()
While it looks ok when exporting, I'm not sure that it is ok when importing files because we have problems when file is prepared on one and used on another platform (nix->win, win->nix)

Is there any workarround that I could use to inform (__DbDelim) to use both sequences as EOL mark

Thanks in advance,
Best Regards,

Vito

Przemek:

1)  The DO WHILE loop (3rd example out of my list of three examples) I ran
in the first message in this thread actually will return the decimal data.
In my post, it couldn't find the file, because it's attrib was +h, hidden.
:)

2)  The first two " ? FILEATTR " examples I wrote, are indeed a bug like you
mentioned.

3)  What my goal is, is to simply implement an attribute changer, to remove
things like -h, -s, -r dos attrib switches a file... without having to read
in the current bitwise decimal, do an AND / XOR on it, and then reset it.
FUNCKy lets you avoid all that by you supplying a T/F flag that either sets,
or disables the attribs, based simply the bitwise decimals you want to
adjust.  Is there an HB_ function to do this?  I looked at the change log
and grep'd around, but couldn't make sense out of some of the stuff because
it wasn't documented.  Please give me a hint, if any.  If there isn't one to
do this, can you suggest a safe way for me to program it, without me having
to worry that in any new versions of Harbour, my code might break due to
your bugfixes?

Thank you for everything

Viktor, I would love to help out on the documentation project.  I consider
myself a decent writer who can explain things clearly and give examples that
prove all nooks and cranny's of something.  If you are interested in giving
me a task to start off with, I'd be very glad to help, since you and others
have been incredibly helpful, saving me days of hair-pulling frustration.

This is the spirit.

Thank you for offering such a helping hand.
I am sure Viktor will guide you in this direction.

There is probably a better way as I guess someone will be able to 
suggest, but if you need a quick solution then in nix you could try 
dos2unix or unix2dos to adjust the files as needed.

Hi

More deeper analysis revealed that multiple freeing of 
pointers is triggered if an invalid pointer is sent to hb_xfree().
Like this:

   delete ( ( QWidget * ) p->ph );
   delete p->ph;                          // this triggers multiple freeing

So the test scenario I presented is wrong altogether.
only 
   delete ( ( QWidget * ) p->ph );
is enough and operator in our stub is called.

Good news is that hbXBP/demoxbp.exe stays almost 
on the same level of memory usage, the phenomena hogging 
me all the time.

The bad news is, for some delete calls our operator is never 
reached, especially after application exit, and fm log reports
unreleased memory block.

Still under test scenario, will update if I could find anything useful.

Viktor, is not it a good idea to put this stub in hbqt.lib itself ?

If you are interested in giving me a task to start off with, I'd be very glad to help, since you and others have been incredibly helpful, saving me days of hair-pulling frustration.

Thank you very much for volunteering.

At the moment we use the NFLIB documentation 
"standard", which you can find many examples 
for in /doc/en-EN/ hierarchy. [ We also have an 
automated tool which can process it, called 
hbdoc2 (in examples). ]

So this is the best we can offer in this area, 
anyhow if you have some more comfortable way 
to create documentation, please use it, my 
only guideline would be to use a format which 
can be processed with automated tools to make 
it possible to convert it to other formats 
(like pdf or html, etc)

I'd also welcome _up to the point_, short ideas 
from other list members.

Brgds,
Viktor

If you can precisely locate such an occasion, you can 
try to look up the internals in QT source code. This 
way you can track down what exactly gets executed.

No, we discarded the idea, as it might be possible 
that Harbour apps are used with other C++ projects 
(even private ones), where such HBQT specific solution 
wouldn't solve the problem. Also, making this trick 
local to HBQT would mean that it cannot be mixed with 
any other C++ project which does the same redirection 
in local code. So we concluded it should be in hbmk2.

Viktor

Thanks for your suggestion.
Unforunately that would be my last choice.

There are more then one file (few different files with different data 
structure) that is to be used from same source (same Company). It allready 
happend that they switch from LF EOL to CRLF EOL without any notice, so I 
must be prepared to read both types. Also this program will run as automated 
(daily) task on WinServer

If I don't find propers workarround (or extension) in Append From, I will 
have to FRead() :((

Thanks again,

Vito

I have same documentation but i am also a bad writer
i can share via google document with you
we must search a way that allow an on line collaboration from user


1 fist idea for harbour doc
we need a little dbf for create index of document where one document
maj be present in one or more categories and define his see also...
implement in hbdoc2 follow dbf as index
nomefile,categories
Nomefile,
Categories, Function,Classm,command
                 Array,rdd,database,string,mat eccc
                 Multi Tread
We need two kind of works:
  Document all function (hndoc2 and similar)
  Document harbour concepts
Follow my proposal  of structure of harbour documentation
Harbour QuickStart with info for each platform
Harbour hbmk2
Harbour Advanced How to parameter for compiling harbour (c_usr)  & SVN

Harbour Concept :
Harbour standard Library (difference from clipper.lib and extend.lib)
Harbour basic Rdd
Harbour Client server using netio ecc,
Harbour sql
Harboutr GT same application multiple platform
Harbour Mulkti thread and st
Harbour semi offical gui & hbqt ,hbxbp
Harbour other contrib


The Clipper documentation as basic starting point
we can have also other documentation project
where import same  info if possible:

clipper documentation is material covered by copiright
http://www.itlnet.net/programming/program/Reference/c53g01c/menu.html

The harbour minigui project have a documentation pdf
I think that Can added to Harbour.doc
http://hmgs-minigui.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/hmgs-minigui/minigui/Harbour/doc/%28x%29harbour.chm


Clip a Xbase langiage CA-Clipper compatible compile
CLIP project now use the DocBook documentation system to provide
multiformat and multilanguage documentation in the strong and regular
fasion.
The good introduction into DocBook is DocBook - The Definition Guide.

Sorry, but this is nor short neither up to the point.

Harbour needs descriptions for the functions it offers, 
that's the most important.

If someone has useful and practical advice to add to help 
Smu to get started, please do.

Subject: [Harbour] hbQT - Events and Slots Parameters Change
Message-ID: <1264890515674-4487197.post@n2.nabble.com>


Hello Everybody

I am in the middle of overhaul of Events and Slots protocols
which is aimed at to get rid of the GC pointer reference counting.

I have changed the parameters how Events and Slots are calling
.prg level code blocks. Current implementation is dispatching codeblock 
as  ( prg equivalent )
      
     Eval( EventOrSlotBlock, pObject, ... )

The first argument is pointer to the object calling the codeblock,
and this is a GC collectible pointer. And hence the current situation
renders it GPF prone.

I have changed this arument to numeric zero instead of pointer to th object
just to retain compatibility with th existing code where codeblocks are 
expecting first parameter as "something" which in reality has not been 
used either of the implementation, viz., hbXBP and hbIDE.

Changing argument from pointer to integer is working fine.

But I am convinced that avoiding this parameter is best for the long run.
First for the simplicity of the prg code and also the speed.

I know many of you have based your libraries on the above foundation,
and this change will require you to look deeply into your code, though
I think it will be fairly easy, so I propose to eliminate it altogether.

Waiting for the responses for next few hours and then I will decide 
in its favour.

I don't have HBQT based programs, though I think we're 
so early in HBQT development in Harbour that it's 
simply natural to have changes like this until things 
settle to their ideal, final form.

I believe most, if not all HBQT users are all closely 
following this list, and I'm sure everyone will adapt, 
especially if such change is required to have a solid 
base system.

IOW it would be shooting ourselves in the foot, if 
we gave compatibility a priority over fixing things, 
at this early point of development.

my 2 cents.

Brgds,
Viktor

After supressing hbvmopt.h I get a lot compile errors. This hb_arraySeek 
function is based upon hb_arrayScan and is quite similar to it and so it 
seems to need hbvmopt.h to be compiled.
Without hbvmopt.h I get the compile errors listed below and with hbvmopt.h 
the compile goes fine but the linkage doesn't work (undefined reference to 
'hb_stack' error), but before the change to harbour 2.0 it was possible to 
compile the same code normally.
Any directions?
Thanks,
Leandro

Hi,

Probably you try to use internals in your .c code.
(accessing HB_BASEARRAY f.e.)

I can't recommend doing that in any application as 
these are not guaranteed interfaces/structures, plus 
it may cause several other problems (alignment 
dependence, corrupting VM internals, MT/ST mode 
dependence, code breaking when Harbour internals 
happen to change).

In fact not even Harbour RTL and other libs 
except VM are allowed to use them.

So my suggestion it to use the documented Harbour 
C API. You can find these in hbapi*.h headers for 
the most part.

I guess most things can be solved with it; if not, 
you may describe the situation and if justified 
and doable we can add new API functions.

Brgds,
Viktor

ok Viktor, I see. That's what happened indeed.

Sure. Could you tell me how to do the following through the C API?

1) get the length of the array, instead of method below:

PHB_BASEARRAY pBaseArray = pArray->item.asArray.value;
ULONG ulLen = pBaseArray->ulLen ;

2) eval a codeblock with a member of the array as a parameter and get the 
return of the block, instead of the following:
HB_STACK_TLS_PRELOAD
hb_vmPushSymbol( &hb_symEval );
hb_vmPush( pBlock );
hb_vmPush( pBaseArray->pItems + ulPosition );
hb_vmPushLong( ulPosition );
hb_vmSend( 2 );
pItem = (PHB_ITEM) hb_stackReturnItem();

Thank you
Leandro

hb_arrayLen( pArray )

Never needed in user code.

hb_arrayGetItemPtr( ulPosition + 1 )

Rest should work, though if you need more 
eval examples, I'd recommend grepping into 
Harbour contrib or core (except VM) source 
code, you'll find plenty of working examples.

    ! This commit has cleaned Qt wrappers not to 
      hold any GC collectible pointer inside. Events 
      and Slots protocol is completely re-structured.
      
    % Improved HB_TRACE() logs. Now Qt wrappers can be 
      generated with relevant filter if env variable 
      HBQT_BUILD_TR_LEVEL=HB_TR_ALWAYS|ERROR|etc 
      defalt being TR_LEVEL_DEBUG. The formatting is 
      also improved.

    % Signals are fired with exact same parametres 
      found in Qt documentation. Eearlier first parameter
      was object pointer followed by slots's parameters.
      This facilitates for the speed and better code
      maintenance.

    ! Intensive debugging has shown that - operator new() -
      is always called from cpp stub generated by hbMK2 
      but for operater delete(), behavior is inconsistent.
      All classes derived from QObject() never call delete()
      in the stub, some classes, which Qt defines as "on the 
      stack" call our stub and hence memory is released.
      Perhaps this is the main reason, I cannot get back
      all the momory if another dialog is opened and closed.
      All claases which are derived from Qt class, viz., HbQ*
      are released properly. Looking at this behavior it 
      comes to mind if all classes are sub-classed? A very 
      huge job nevertheless which I may take later.

This is the latest stub.

One run of hbIDE - enter/exit reveals that 
   new() is issued 1439 times
   delete() is issued 300 times
   hb_out.log reports 1139 unreleased blocks.


===========================

   const char * __hbmk2_hbcppmm( void )
   {
      return "HBCPPMM";
   }
   int getnew( void )
   {
      static int i = 0;
      return ++i;
   }
   int getdelete( void )
   {
      static int i = 0;
      return ++i;
   }
   void * operator new( size_t nSize )
   {
      if( nSize == 0 )
         nSize = 1;
      void * ptr = hb_xgrab( nSize );
HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ( "                new(  %p ) %i  %i", ptr, nSize,
getnew() ) );
      return ptr;
   }
   void operator delete( void * ptr )
   {
      if( ptr )
      {
HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ( "<      delete( void * %p ) %s  %i", ptr, "        
0", getdelete() ) );
         hb_xfree( ptr );
HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ( "             ( void *           ) %s", "           
1 >" ) );
      }
   }

========================

Can someone try on his system too ?

I've done a clean Harbour on Ubuntu 9.04.
demoqt and demoxbp seem to work but hbide gives at start:

Error BASE/1004  No exported method: SETMOUSETRACKING
Called from SETMOUSETRACKING(0)

Hi Pritpal,

It's also possible that simple 'free()' is called on these 
pointers causing a GPF.

You can try linking in free() function override with trace 
message to see whether they are being called.

Viktor

I tried something like this:

   void free( void * ptr )
   {
      if( ptr )
      {
HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ( "<        free( void * %p ) %s  %i", ptr, "        
0", getdelete() ) );
         hb_xfree( ptr );
HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ( "             ( void *           ) %s", "           
1 >" ) );
      }
   }

But no call is routed to this function.

I also tried:
   void operator free( void * ptr )  does not compile.

Any tips ?

Subject: [Harbour] Extented FM Stats with new trace macro HB_TRFM.
Message-ID: <4B65A560.20707@gmail.com>

Hi All,

I've done extented FM Stats ST/MT for HB_FM_STATISTICS with new trace macro HB_TRFM().
This allows to show in hb_out.log the allocation of the pointer covert by the macro.

HB_TRFM( pPtr = (char *)hb_xgrab( size ) );

or .-

HB_TRFM( pObj = ( QTextDecoder* ) new QTextDecoder( hbqt_par_QTextCodec( 1 ) ) );

In order to have in hb_out.log for HB_FM_STATISTICS .-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
Total memory allocated: 234123 bytes (4176 block(s))
Warning, memory allocated but not released: 1020 bytes (2 block(s))
Block 1 0xd88970 (size 200) MYFUNCTION(256), "200F200F ..."
myfile.c:256 [ char *pPtr = (char *)hb_xgrab( size ) ]
Block 2 0xe4a990 (size 200) QT_QTEXTDECODER(129), "200F200F ..."
qtcore.cpp:129 [ pObj = ( QTextDecoder* ) new QTextDecoder( hbqt_par_QTextCodec( 1 ) ) ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think with this FM Stats do it more human-readable.
The code is 100% compatible with existing. If not used HB_TRFM and HB_FM_STATISTICS you have the same until now.

Macro have coverage until the first comma, for example in the expression .-

pObj = ( QPoint* ) new QPoint( hb_parni( 1 ), hb_parni( 2 ) ) ;

Use .-

HB_TRFM( pObj = ( QPoint* ) new QPoint)( hb_parni( 1 ), hb_parni( 2 ) ) ;

If you want I can commit it in SVN.

Hi,

IMO such function is better be called HB_TRACEALLOC() 
(HB_TRACE*()) in any case).

Anyhow its usefulness is limited as it requires 
code changes in thousands of places and these changes 
are quite intrusive, since they make code more difficult 
to read.

I think that valgrind gives us this (and much more) 
already, so we should use it rather than compromising 
code readability.

Other opinions?

Brgds,
Viktor

Don't change the existing but new or 3-prt libraries can take advantage of this.
Also, perhaps in the future, the macro can be extended to other checks and the code is not more difficult than HB_TRACE.

Unfortunately valgrind not exist in Windows and the alternatives are expensive.
And we already have FM.

Can you change line #133 of idedocks.prg as 

   ::oDlg:qtObject := HbQtUI():new( ::resPath + "mainWindow.ui" )
=>
   ::oDlg:qtObject := HbQtUI():new( ::resPath + "mainwindow.ui" )

See the difference, "W" => "w".
Probably this should fix this issue, tell me.

Shouldn't these file load operations be checked for success to 
detect such typos more easily?

Are you saying that using this macro in required source will be enough?
If yes, my vote is yes. Better if it is one line but formatted like a
record.

Here is what I suggest:

char *pPtr = (char *)hb_xgrab( size ) ] 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^....
One line per block.
Fixed Length every field except last.
Memory dump be optional and at the end ( formatted to fixed length ).

I find existing implementation difficult to follow especially in large logs.

It is detected but at the HbQtUI level but is reported on appln level.
Anyway it generates rte. What is the better way?

Can you show me hb_out.log of hbIDE on *nixes ?

I can see that, and I frankly don't understand why many 
of the layers you added to it was needed (in hbqt, hbxbp).

Please try to experiment with current features, as I believe 
most of the above can be solved with them, without adding 
any sort of extra abstraction or tricks.

Let's pls try to keep it simple.

Brgds,
Viktor

I don't know the details of current code, but either 
some function should return .T./.F., or some object 
should stay empty (NIL or nul ptr), or maybe an error 
code of some sort should be made available. In my 
personal opinion RTE for file open errors is not the 
best.

For sure now if I delete resources/mainwindow.ui, I'm 
getting the same RTE as others are reporting. But it's 
reporting "no exported method" in SETMOUSETRACKING(), 
which is not precise indication of a load/open error.

Brgds,
Viktor

I don't see any hb_out.log now.

If you mean the stderr output, here is what I get from ./hbide 2>
hbide.log, simply starting and closing it.

Please compil Harbour with -DHB_FM_STATISTICS first.
Only then you can receive hb_out.log.

Hi All

Here are the source and .hbi to investigate in deep
what actually is causing increased memory scenario.

http://n2.nabble.com/file/n4491053/debugmemory.zip debugmemory.zip 

Download this .zip and unzip it in hbide/projects.
Load it in hbIDE and rebuild. You must have Qt environment set.
You may need to change Qt lib location in .hbi.

To have more traces, change HB_TR_DEBUG calls in QMessageBox.cpp
to HB_TR_ALWAYS and build Qt.

Then Launch.

Kepp a watch on memory usage with every invocation of msg box.

Sorry to be missing the point, but what is HbXbp_Just() ?

If it's meant to pull in forcefully some parts of HBXBP, 
probably it should be renamed to 'HBXBP' and using 
'REQUEST HBXBP' in apps.

Another comment:

You started to add *_DBG() functions. Here it's called HBIDE_DBG(). 
But why not use HB_TRACELOG( params ) instead, if you want to force 
trace calls in live code? F.e. HB_TRACELOG( "hello" )

Anyhow it's much more efficient to use 'HB_TRACE()' since it will be 
excluded from code for final builds, and not causing any slowdowns 
because of permanently switched on logging.

Some of these may apply to HBXBP and HBQT, I didn't check what is 
exactly used there.

Viktor

And since this is the first project ever posted on the internet, 
I checked what's inside its '.hbi' file:

---
[ PROPERTIES ]
Type              = Executable
Title             = debugmemory
Location          = C:/harbour/contrib/hbide/projects
WorkingFolder     = C:/harbour/contrib/hbide/projects
DestinationFolder = C:/harbour/contrib/hbide/projects
Output            = debugmemory
LaunchParams      = 
LaunchProgram     = 
BackupFolder      = 
 
[ FLAGS ]
-nohbcppmm

c:/harbour/contrib/hbxbp/hbxbp.hbc
-inc
-w3 -es2 -gc3
-Lc:\qt\2009.03\qt\lib
 
[ SOURCES ]
C:/harbour/contrib/hbide/projects/debugmemory.prg
C:/harbour/contrib/hbide/projects/debugstub.cpp
 
[ METADATA ]
---

Now, this won't work on most ppl's computer, especially 
not on non-Windows ones, since it contains hard-coded 
paths for all things. I don't understand why 'workingfolder' 
should be included at all, and why include 'location' 
which is supposed to be the directory where this file is 
_saved_ (and the dir pulled from the filename when opening 
it). DestinationFolder should be also a relative path to 
'location', in this case simple left empty. Output is 
-o option. etc.

This was one reason I insisted on .hbp files, which 
doesn't suffer of this problem. Also, instead of 
-Lc:\qt\2009.03\qt\lib, HB_WITH_QT should be set on 
users' PC and call it a day, but I keep saying it, and 
it keeps being ignored :(

Brgds,
Viktor

Destination is location folder if kept empty. The value inside

Probably you do not understood visual design.
Though everything can be passed as flags, visual design 
is better sited to fetch is from user and supply to the underlying
sub system.

This is all visual vs console.

Scheduled to be put in {hbmk2} section of .env.

Again you are using the word "ignored".
Please think of hbIDE in visual terms. Everything 
obtained is passed to sub-system, in this case, hbMK2.
Probably we are conflicting on re-use of components "as is".
Right ?

This is all to initiate INIT PROCEDURES to start an Qt application.
This I could have done demoqt.prg way, but just because of lazyness,
I used this shortcut.

REQUEST HBXBP is not needed if QApplication() is called as first line.

As I remember, you initiated the init/exit procedures on QApplication.cpp.
I did not investigate the final rsults, it it is true, then this call is
redundant.

You are right.

This small code snipper I pulled from testing hbide.prg so 
these surfaced as is. Just a little lazyness.

These calls just separate logging code from .cpp files, nothing else.

BTW, without looking at the logs, only glaring the 
Windows task manager will reveal how mem is consumed with every
call to messageBox().

I don't get it. hbmk2 doesn't require any sort of information 
like that. It only needs the position of .hbp file and 
calculates everything dynamically. Same can be done by 
HBIDE, if it needs to do it for some reason. (f.e. to 
launch the app, but for this, -run can be used also)

I don't understand, sorry :(

If you open a file, you can calculate it's location, since 
if a full path is passed, you just use it as is, extract dir 
part. If a relative dir is passed, you can merge it with 
hb_dirbase(), and pull the dir then. I committed the function 
which can do the merging.

I understand that, it's redundant though.

It shouldn't be. If you tell me this in advance I don't 
spend a few hours on the parser.

Sorry but "visual" has no meaning for me in this context, 
especially when it's used as a tool to justify such design. 
Nothing tells that "visual" tools have to be based on wrong 
low-level concepts, storing unnecessary and platform dependent 
information in files. It also doesn't determine file formats 
used. (even Word managed to save its stuff in standard .xml 
files eventually)

I'm very sorry Pritpal, but I have to realize we're on completely 
different grounds. I'm a little bit surprised because last 
time it again seemed we managed to sync the goals. But either 
I misunderstood you completely in all of these occasions, or 
these answer were just to silence me.

It's quite disappointing to see these, and with such basic 
problems, I understand that HBIDE will most probably not 
become the tool of my choice in the future. (f.e. it's impossible 
to integrate it with so called "non-visual" environments. Using 
HBIDE is now an _all or nothing_ decision, but maybe this is 
what "visual" users are used to.)

Anyway for now I turned HBQT/HBXBP/HBIDE off on my system, 
for me it apparently became a waste of energy.

Brgds,
Viktor

Subject: [Harbour] 24 hour wait loop in telephaty
Message-ID: <1264984252804-4491844.post@n2.nabble.com>


One more tweak needed.

IF TimeOut = 0 the loops wont be executed. (it should be executed once )

      (hb_vmCDP() is declared in hbapicdp.h, is this ok?)

Subject: [Harbour] Debugging c code
Message-ID: <SNT109-W40ABCFF5C80AF445F23153EF580@phx.gbl>

When my C level code does not release memory, the fm statistics reports this but gives the public function though in some cases the allocation occured in a sub-function.  

Is there a macro I can use to identify this sub-function?  I could leave it in the code wrapped conditional code for debug only.
