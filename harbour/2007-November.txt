Yes, not all expressions. Logical expression values depends on 
optimisation/shortcutting. BTW, it is very compatible with Clipper and 
Harbour implementation:
  .T. .AND. X => X
  .F. .AND. X => .F.

I think we are at deeper level than wiki here. From the first look it 
can look that records containing NULL field are ignored, but I do not 
think it's for encyclopedia to describe the aspects of it's implementation.

I haven't tested any other language on NULL support because I have no 
VFP, no C#, ant no other compiler which supports NULL. I see only Miguel 
letter about NULL support in VFP.

It could be that RDBMS uses different NULL handling rules than 
programming languages, but it's natural. Languages and RDBMS has 
different developers, difference concept. Using SQL-like NULL does not 
allow code optimization. I'm not surprised that some languages does not 
want to implement it in SQL way. If we will create one more NULL 
implementation, Oracle server will not start to be compatible with us. 
The same situation exist in other languages.

We must ask ourself, that is the goal of NULL implementation in Harbour? 
I see these goals:
1) NULL support for RDD tables
2) SQL-compatible expressions for filters, ex.
      SET FILTER TO AGE < 25

The first could be implemented using a few RDD functions without any 
influence on Harbour virtual machine. It's enough to implement 
FIELDISNULL()/FIELDSETNULL().
If someone want to have more SQL compatible expressions, Przemek 
suggested also ISNULL(<fieldname>), but it looks a little bit hacky 
solution for me:

So, having FIELDISNULL() (or other similar name function) is enough to 
make filters with SQL behaviour, but expression of filters will be a 
little different, ex.:
    SET FILTER TO !FIELDISNULL("AGE") .AND. AGE < 25
It will be programmers responsibility to add: !FIELDISNULL("AGE") .AND.


If we want full SQL-compatible support (to reach the second goal), we 
must make many HVM modifications to introduce NULL, and we will have one 
more variation of undefined item. For many programmers it will be not 
clear different between NULL and NIL. It will affect work of operators, 
we will have to drop jump optimization by default, add some compile time 
switches for those, who are not going to use NULL and want code to be 
optimized. We will have to runtime functions like STR(), etc, to support 
NULL. UDF function will have to test for NULL if it is intended to be 
used in filter expressions. I guess, it will be hard to be Clipper 
compatible in some cases, because of side effects of NULL implementation.
And finally we will have one more NULL implementation, that will be 
compatible with some languages and some SQL servers, and incompatible 
with another languages and another SQL servers.
Do we want this?

I haven't read this letter before I've wrote my last one, but it seems

Sorry, but not only VFP can works with .NULL. , as you know

dBase - Clipper - Harbour are based to work with DBF basically, and actual
DBF supports NULL values, All compilers that works with DBF support it.
Except Harbour - ....

I don't know the reason why you don't want to progress in this way.
I try to explain all questions about this behaviour. And no problems exists.
All expected results are easily posible, in the same way that works SQL, DBF
and others.

Implementation at VM is simple question, and a programer election to use it.
Not exist incompatibilites.

The code now is not eficient, it can't suppor NULL values. that exists in
DBFS

FIELD->AV := FIELD->AD // If AD is Null, now not asign a Null value at AV.

Nil is diferent to Null , Null is an status of any type od item and Nil is
an item.

Przemek,
Exactly this is why I send this messages. Even if in a so simplicity
definitions they have differences. Personally I don't care for such an
addition and I think that the implementation must be RDBMS dependent (Not in
the kernel of Harbour) but internally in each RDBMS Harbour implementation.

Mike EVans

Mike, both descriptions are results of very simple design decisions
about NULL arithmetic. The main problem is that such descriptions are
very often imprecise and created by people who usually try to describe
their experiences but they do not have deeper knowledge about
implementation of VM used by given RDBMS and for people which for
sure will not have any ideas how RDBMS are created.
For me much more important are results of some simple tests. They
will tell me much more about internal implementation then very long
descriptions.
BTW In this case both text probably describe nearly the same and compatible
behavior with the exception to explicit comparison to NULL what is only one
of conditions in NULL arithmetic.

Przemek

The expected results are :

 SetNull( lVar1 )
 lVar2 := !lVar1
 lVar3 := !lVar2
 ? IIF( lVar1, "X", "Y" )   => "Y"

Token .NULL. is traspased in all operations (as undetermined value)

When a conditional expression encounters a null value, the condition fails,
because .NULL. is not true (.T.). For example, a FOR clause that evaluates
to .NULL. is treated as false (.F.). Note that null values are treated as
.NULL. until the entire expression is evaluated.

      Numeric Numeric expressions that evaluate to .NULL. return .NULL. A
numeric function evaluates to .NULL. when passed a null value.
      Date Date expressions containing null values return .NULL.


a.. SQL Aggregate functions ignore instead of propagate null values.
a.. Visual FoxPro aggregate functions only propagate .NULL. if all supplied
values are null values; otherwise, any null value is ignored.


the code at VFP will be

 LOCAL lVar1 := .T., lVar2, lVar3
     lVar1 := .NULL.
     lVar2 := ! lVar1
     lVar3 := ! lVar2
     ? IIF( lVar1, "X", "Y" )        // => "Y"
     ? IIF( lVar2, "X", "Y" )        // => "Y"
     ? IIF( lVar3, "X", "Y" )        // => "Y"
     ? IIF( !(!(lVar1)), "X", "Y" ) // => "Y"

Reality is a bit more complicated here:

- dBase: Has no NULL support.
- CA-Clipper: Has no NULL support.
- VO: Has some NULL support in some SQL specific classes only (clean  
solution).
- Flagship: Has no NULL support.
- XBase++: Has some very clean NULL support, but it's limited to a  
few NULL-aware functions
       and one SET. Basically NULL is either emulated with NIL or  
with an empty value, depending
       on this SET.
- CLIP: Has no NULL support.
- FoxPro: Has no NULL support.
- Harbour/xhb: Has no NULL support.
- Visual dBase: I have no information.

That leaves VFP the only dialect which has "native" NULL support,
or support for the ".NULL." syntax. (maybe Visual dBase)

To me, the XBase++ approach looks the best here, which is about the
same as the one proposed by Przemek.

The discussions about the issues shows otherwise.

Aside from technical questions:

1) the NIL vs. NULL confusion is a real problem for those who want
    to grasp the language.
2) NULL is an ill fated and debated feature even in the SQL scene,
    and a frequent root of problems in many development work.

It's difficult to tell the reason why MS introduced it in VFP, but
it tells something that not much later they've simply killed the
product altogether.

Yes, but for someone not deeply into these topics, the two "types" don't
seem very different; and their purpose is also somewhat similar, but
implemented differently.

And this is sth what cannot be implemented.
If we have code:

   SET FILTER TO AGE < 25  // (1)
   WHILE !EOF()
      IF SOLARY < 100      // (2)
         MYFUNC()
      ENDIF
      SKIP
   ENDDO

Then RDD and later RDBMS will know about expression (1) but exprssion
(2) is evaluated only by our HVM. So in evaluating (1) excludes record
where AGE IS NULL but evaluating (2) does not exclude records where
SOLARY IS NULL. The only one way to resolve the problem problem is having
NULL implementation as close as possible to RDBMS in HVM. And this is the
only one reason to have NULL value in HVM. It's absolutely unimportant
if C#, VFP, or any other language support NULL value - we do not have to
be compatible with them. For us the only one place where NULL support may
be important is possible interaction with foreign RDBMSes because we may
exchange data and expressions with them so the same expression evaluated
by us may give different results then evaluated by RDBMS what may cause
some unexpected behavior in final application. But it does not mean that
we have to introduce NULL value to HVM. It should be result of simple
calculation of costs and improvements. From the beginning I'd like to
show that in some cases it will not be possible to add NULL support
without reducing existing functionality like some of compile time
optimizations.
This is the reason I was asking Miguel about NULL arithmetic used by VFP.
I still do not know how VFP works and I do not now to guess. I need precise
results from executed code.
And if:
   !VarNull => .F.
then in Harbour we have to disable optimization which reduce:
   !(!<exp>)
to:
   <exp>
to be VFP compatible. If the above is not true and:
   !VarNull => NULL
and NULL works in logical expression like .F. then we will have to
disable conditional jump optimization (for forward jumps only this
can be resolved by small trick but not for backward jumps) and jump
joining.

Thank you. So this are the same results as in Postgres.

Now it has more sense. This is the reason why real results are better
then descriptions or documentations because they are often wrong.
In summary this are the same results as in Postgress and MySQL.

And now you should begin to see the problem.
Neither:
    IF <nullExp>
       ? "EXP"
    ENDIF
nor:
    IF !<nullExp>
       ? "EXP"
    ENDIF
can print "EXP"

This can be resolved by always executing conditional jumps.
Unfortunately also:
    IF <nullExp> .or. <falseExp>
       ? "EXP"
    ENDIF

cannot print "EXP" and here such simple trick will not help due to
optimized code generated for .OR. You will have to restore some old
code which was generating unoptimized code for all logical expressions
with series of DUPLICATE pcodes inside or always enable -z compiler
switch. 
This are not all problems but if you still do not see them then I think
you should try to implement NULL value and test the example below. F.e.

  LOCAL var := .F., var2 := .F.
  SETNULL( var )
  IF var
     ? "EXP1"
  ELSE
     ? "NO EXP1"
  ENDIF
  IF !var
     ? "EXP2"
  ELSE
     ? "NO EXP2"
  ENDIF
  IF var .or. var2
     ? "EXP3"
  ELSE
     ? "NO EXP3"
  ENDIF

The expected results are:
    NO EXP1
    NO EXP2
    NO EXP3

BTW you can test if VFP is working in such way - it's possible
that in some deeper tests you will begin to discover some bugs
in VFP NULL implementation.

I've worked with many SQL RDBMS since 1985 and I can say that nobody I
know want NULLs.  IMHO it is more an "academic" issue to keep the
theory "clean".
And this is even more evident today with SQL/XML merge. How to "safely
describe" NULLs when load/save XML between different sources? How to
"safely know" that a user input is NULL?

There aren't NULLs in my data :) and it is the last thing I'd like to
see implemented in Harbour.

Absolutly disagree. This is not "the only way". The other way
is to raise RTE. In this case the properly written code should
be :

    SET FILTER TO AGE < 25  // (1)
    WHILE !EOF()
       IF NOT IsNull(SOLARY) .AND. SOLARY < 100      // (2)
          MYFUNC()
       ENDIF
       SKIP
    ENDDO

And this example is in *no way* different than its SQL'ish
counterpart. Neither C#, VB, PowerBuilder handles it the
way you try to describe/define.

True. This is classic SQL handling.

But the decision is not based on "magic information" taken from column.
It's results of simple code evaluation and NULL arithmetic.

Marek, because we are talking about existing Clipper code
then please be so kind and also make "properly written code"
from this example:

    PROC MYPROC(cFile)
    exp := dbSetFiler()
    SET FILTER TO
    COPY TO (cFile) FOR &exp NEXT 100 VIA DELIM
    SET FILTER TO &exp
    RETURN

or any other similar which will use different xbase commands to
manipulate data. Please note that in some cases expression evaluating
will be done on client side and in some other on server and of course
user cannot guess where because it's only RDD<->RDBMS decision. It's
even possible that the same command can be evaluate locally and
remotely depending on some other conditions (f.e. data in cache).
You have just said that we have to forget about such possibilities.
I can agree because, I also do not need NULL value myself and I do
not like most of RDBMS so I usually try to not use them.
But I'm not sure if you fully understand the conclusion:
it will not be possible to write optimized RDD working with remote
servers which will be safe to use with tables containing NULL values
and will not force existing Clipper code updating.
In such case to avoid possible data corruption and unexpected results
I suggest to force RTE ASAP. Mapping NULL value to NIL can give such
functionality.

Exactly all old or obsolete compilers don't support NULL values :)

I only want to understand why you seems to stop harbour project at the past.
Almoust it seems.

That is the question, suport it or not support it.

work as modern compilers or alive in the past ?

in other compilers Nil works as Empty value, and Null works as never used or
initialized.
for example you can found .Empty. and .Null. at the las version of FoxPro,
Microsoft is
developing sucessor of FoxPro now named Microsoft Visual FoxPro Sedna

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=CC84F749-A153-4929-8277-DEB9A2F8B0A5&displaylang=en

All SQL databases that I know supports NULL values, and DBF too support it.

The reason to support NULL values are that we are founding tables which
support it, and we need to manage its values
easily.

If logical values in DBF has 3 estates (" ","T","F") and we want to use
checkboxes that too supports 3 states, its imperative
implement NULL values to use all the power of windows api, for example. I
think that in linux its checkboxes has 3 states too.

I'm developing and easy way of NULL values for xHarbour, but I don't want
separate more Harbour and xHarbour
I expect that one day if is posible 2 compilers are only one.

Miguel Angel Marchuet

This is more similar to vb code
Programm can made a lot error thank to this vision

IMO if implemented is required something like 
SET NULL EXPLICIT [ON/OFF]

Hi,


hb_fsFileExist return TRUE also for directories, devices, etc.
Shouldn't we return TRUE for files only?

Hi,


is it possible to use UTF8 in DBF character fields and have correct 
sorting of UTF8 strings?

I test with VFP 8 and works fine as expected

     NO EXP1
     NO EXP2
     NO EXP3

Yes, I see now that you are right. It blocks some important
funcionality unnecesary. And I agree with you it is unacceptable.

 From what Miguel writes about VFP, it seems that VFP implements full
"ANSI NULL" behavior on a language level. Much like you have proposed
it in one of your ealier posts. I don't know about any other language
that does the same. And I am not sure I like this idea, based on an
experience obtained from old Informix 4GL, thru PowerBuilder, to
current C#.

So, yes, introducing "ANSI NULL" into Harbour language will end up in
disabling JUMP opimisations, revising existing functions to properly
react on NULL parameters, adding proper handling of NULLs to existing
operators, and implement "NULL is NOT TRUE" paradigm for logical
expressions/conditions.

I am not sure it is worth the efforts. But if anyone wants to try it
I have nothing against.

If you work with DBF, you have NULL in your data probably, but you
see logical NULL fields as .F., but if you use for example DataArquitect
to open your files, then you can see your NULLS.

NULL are important, for example in the implementation of checkboxes you needs 3 states.
and this states are saved in only one logical field. Now Harbour can do it. Microsoft platform
and borland platform can do it with DBF.

If you don't want to use NULL, don't use it. But other developers ?.
The great part of developers that I know like to use NULL :)

How can 3 state checkboxes created in an HTML form?

On my shelf I have Foxpro 2.5 ( the DOS one ) and Visual Foxpro 3 and
5 among several boxes with VB, Visual Studio, Delphi, Visual Dbase...

If I don't use them ( anymore ) is because I think that today they are useless.

For me ( only my personal point of view ) the desktop we have known in
the last 10 years is at the end.

With oil at 100$ a PC that need a 500W power supply, 2GB of RAM and
200GB of HD to run Vista and IE7 is a bad waste of energy. This kind
of hardware will probably land in our living-room to watch TV, DVDs
and play MP3 but my business users are demanding me energy and space
saving hardware, WEB, mobility and platform neutrality because they
want their apps and data wherever they are with whatever they have:
M$, Linux, MacOSX desktops, SmartPhones, PDA, notebooks connected at
the hotel's lan...

If I wanted to follow M$ I would use Visual Studio, if I wanted to
follow Borland I would use Delphi, if I still use Harbour is because I
think that it is still useful and easier to learn and deploy.

Clearly this is not a general rule and can't be true for everyone but
it's my bet.

But this doesn't mean that I don't want to "extend" Harbour simply
NULL support  is not on my wish list.

Lorenzo

Hi Miguel,

VFP is the only non-obsolete compiler and VFP is
terminated as a product, how is that? :)

NULL is one feature out of a thousand. Not supporting
one feature doesn't mean supporting "past".

Yes, they are adding extra feature without any thought
(just a guess), because the software is in maintenance mode,
so they don't need to care about any future consequences, just
support instant needs.

("SEDNA" is an addon to support latest MS technologies for the
last VFP version BTW. It is not a new product)

SQL is a different language than Clipper, and NULL is
part of its standard, so they cannot avoid supporting it.

What you want, is mixing one feature of another language
inside Clipper. (and this feature also behaves differently
in different SQL implementations)

Notice that no one had any objection in supporting NULL
in the RDDs, or even the base RDD functions, but we need to
draw a line where NULL support ends.

If programmers are able to access this information, we're
basically done.

Please examine the XBase++ method for such an implementation.

This is solved by using the XBase++ method.

I personally find it odd (hackish) to use NULL in such a way. If you
need a three state checkbox, you're best to define three distinct value
for the states, and store them explicitly. In my experience an "unknown"
state is better be made as an exception, rather than a rule, because
handling such state is always problematic, just because it is unknown.

The point is anyway: You can solve the "unknown" (or "unspecified")
state using fully normal an NULL-less code and ages old concepts,
such as "enum" or simple #define, or whatever else, even NIL.

That's perfectly fine, and we will be able to see your results there.

Incompatibility is bad, but you need to understand that we don't
want to follow xhb, wherever it goes, so incompatibilities may happen.

I'd suggest reading our discussions here and maybe you'll reconsider
implementing NULL support in a less intrusive and more compatible way.

Brgds,
Viktor

With small modification - yes, it may be possible. If you will need it
then I can show you how. Anyhow using UTF8 in DBF character fields has
some bad side effects, f.e. it's possible that not all bytes from
character encoded in UTF8 can be written to field so the result cannot
be cleanly decoded. Even if you accept that you may lost some tailing
character I think that you will want to keep the value correct so it
will be necessary to introduce some "end of string" marker or define
decoding method in such way that it will not accept broken UTF8 characters,
f.e. ignoring them.

Hi Mindaugas,

By the nature of the function it is not (easily and quickly)
possible to decide about the type of the entry.

We'd need to do a FileFind lookup for it and see
the type there, but the problem is, FileFind doesn't
always find all the files. So we'd need to open it
first probably. But that would in turn make it slow.

So, I'd say let's leave it like this, but document it
properly, or rename it to something else, if name might
cause a confusion (like hb_fsAccess() and HB_FACCESS()).

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Przemek, sorry to ask, but what are you updating here exactly?

I'm using these commands to add new files to Harbour:

---
svn add %1
svn propset svn:keywords Id %1
svn propset svn:eol-style native %1
---

Do you see anything wrong with this?

Brgds,
Viktor

I also was looking for sth like that few years ago without success.
I needed to check if I do not miss some important Clipper features.
I haven't found anything so I had to use only my expirience and
make real Clipper tests.

I think that anything what you will find in compiler sources will
have more or less hacks which will depend on implementation. F.e.
it can be easy check that Clipper does not use strict rules like:
    IF {} ENDIF
because it can close IF structure using also NEXT, f.e. test errors
generated by Clipper for:

    IF F()
       ? .T.
    NEXT
    ENDIF

It means that Clipper does not use grammar rules for multi line
statements or or that he uses some common for different statements
closing nonterminal symbols and validate type of symbol outside of
grammar rules.

Yes it makes perfect sense and it will be usable in many cases but
it does not mean it will be the best choice to write compiler gramar
parser. Why you need it?

For 99% of files it's OK. But some files like .bat can be used
only with CRLF and when native eol style is set for them then
I cannot download SVN repository in my Linux box and create DOS
builds in DOSEMU because .bat files do not work. I have no choice
using CVS so I even created some scripts to convert all .bat files
to CRLF and then resotre LF but it was always risk that I'll upload
some of such modified files to SF repository. Now with SVN I simply
set CRLF for .bat and I do not have such problem.

Okey, I'll modify my setting too.

It would be good to have a common subversion config file
for Harbour. Mine looks like this now (but pretty much
untested):

---
[miscellany]
enable-auto-props = yes

[auto-props]
*.* = svn:keywords=Id
*.bat = svn:eol-style=CRLF
*.sh = svn:eol-style=native;svn:executable
*.prg = svn:eol-style=native
*.ch = svn:eol-style=native
*.h = svn:eol-style=native
*.c = svn:eol-style=native
*.txt = svn:eol-style=native
*.png = svn:mimetype=image/png
*.jpg = svn:mimetype=image/jpeg
Makefile = svn:eol-style=native
---

And here are our common file types (without contrib):

*.           322
*.1            6
*.api          9
*.bat         16
*.bc           1
*.c          416
*.cf          59
*.cfg          1
*.cfm          1
*.ch          55
*.def          1
*.gc           1
*.h           61
*.hs           4
*.htm          1
*.ini          3
*.l            2
*.lnk          1
*.mak          1
*.prg        150
*.rsp          1

*.sh          13

*.txt        156
*.vc           1
*.y            2
*.yyc          2
*.yyh          2

Miguel, it was correct and now is broken and bmdbfcdx cannot be

Hello,

I think that we need to remove the "-TP" flag (indicate that source file is a

./contrib/htmllib/makefile.vc

I do not see any problem. I'm using this function for some 5 years:

FUNC FileExist(cFile)
LOCAL nI
   IF cFile == NIL; RETURN .F.
   ENDIF
   nI := GetFileAttributes(cFile)
RETURN nI != -1 .AND. nI & (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY | 
FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE) == 0

I also have a similar DirExist(). It's the same code and test for 
FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY flag. Perhaps it would be nice to have 
hb_fsDirExist() and HB_DIREXIST() also.

BTW, I found we have hb_fsFile() and hb_fsIsDirectory(). These functions 
are implemented using FindFirst(). hb_fsIsFirectory() is not used in any 
harbour code. hb_fsFile() and hb_fsIsDirectory() uses hb_fsNameConv(), 
but hb_fsFileExist() does not use it.
I do not know if we have some File API compatibility issues with 
Clipper. But if not, then hb_fsFileExist()/hb_fsDirExist() seems to be 
more clear names than hb_fsFile() and hb_fsIsDirectory(). Usage of 
hb_fsNameConv() should be also synced.

Mindaugas

Hi,


I see you've changed //...  comments to /* ... */ comments. Is this 
required to ANSI C?
I usually prefer // style, because in this case you can put a big part 
of code containing a lot of // comments into /* */ style comments. It's 
very useful during development and testing. But if this is bad for ANSI 
C, then it's better to say on developers list and agree to not use it.

Mindaugas

You have my vote for hb_fsDirExists() and HB_DIREXISTS().

As for hb_fsNameConv() it needs the Harbour RTL to work,
including the SET system, and it this feature is there
to provide a layer for Harbour programs running on different
OS/FS. So I'd leave hb_fs*Exists() functions in their current
pure forms.

For HB_*EXISTS() functions however, you're right we'd need
to use them.

Yes, it is very old rule, in ANSI C (and thus in Harbour) only /**/
comments have to be used.

"//" comments were introduced with C++ AFAIR.

To be uniform I also prefer /**/ in .prg code in most places,
but this is not a rule, just a preference.

[1] Never use C++ style comments (i.e. // comment).  Always use C-style

Because /* */ comments cannot be nested by definition then for such
multiline commenting I prefer to use:

  #if 0
     ...
  #endif

and I do not have to worry about internal #if 0 / #endif what seems
to be better and more flexible solution (at least for me) then mixed
ANSI and C++ comments.

I vote for hb_fsExist(). If we want to determinate it's file
or directory then I suggest to add also hb_fsFileExist() and
hb_fsDirExist().
hb_fsAccess() should be reserved for access() wrapper (if we
will have it) and also check read/write/execute permissions.

I suggest to add dummy hb_fsNameConv() into source/main/harbour.c
and use it in hb_fs*Exists() functions. In the future we may
move some FS API functions to common library so the problem will
return. Please also remember that the file name conversions may
be necessary even in Windows. F.e. WinCE does not support drive
letters and current directory process attribute. We may want to
add emulation for them in the future and it will interact with
hb_fsNameSplit()/hb_fsNameMerge() functions which are now in
COMMON library.

The next thing is adding some file name conversions to compiler,
f.e. people very often send code examples with:

  #include "InKey.ch"
  #include "DbInfo.ch"
  #include "FILEIO.CH"

etc. and to compile them in case sensitive file system I always
have to retype all such #include with lower letters and each time
I'm doing it I thinking about adding new option to compiler ;-)
so sooner or later we will have it.

We will also need filename conversion in compiler if we want to
add automatic CP and unicode translations at compile time.

Sounds good to me. (but I vote with the "s" at the end of the
names *Exists(), not *Exist())

That sound okey, but we need to untie those functions
from the SET system then. (by adding another layer
of config or something like that).

It's enough to implement alternative conversions in hb_fsNameConv()
from source/main/harbour.c - we do not need to touch code used by RTL.
It's even good because host OS can be different then the destination OS
(f.e. when you create PocketPC/WinCE binaries) so we may need different
conversions during compilation and different during runtime.
BTW The macro HOST_OS_UNIX_COMPATIBLE you removed recently was designed
for such situation, fortunately current cross builds use -D<macro> and
-UNDEF:<macro> compiler switches in platform native harbour binaries
so nothing wrong has happened.

After my last commit if you decide which compiler switch should enable
lowering of file names in all open/create operation then I can implement
and commit such feature in two minutes ;-)

I think it will be worthing to use some tool to create the makefiles for each

I know that is not a easy task, but the benefits are bigger.

What do you think ?

Hi Przemek,

Okey, do we need all four options, just like in the RTL?

- filename casing
- filename trimming
- directory casing
- directory separator

(I'm not sure why filename and dir casing are broken into two options)

Brgds,
Viktor

I think that trimming is less important in source code compilation.
Directory separator is wrongly implemented in [x]Harbour from beginning.
Instead of optional translation we have "\" translation always enabled
and can be disabled only by setting "\" as directory separator so it's
sth what we will have to clean.
Anyhow necessary options will depend on user preferences (I'd like to have
filename lowering for code sent by Windows/DOS Harbour users) but it's
possible that we will need also other like drive or current dir emulation.
Some of them can be done as environment settings, f.e.:
    export HB_DRIVE_A=/mnt/floppy
    export HB_DRIVE_C=/mnt/win
    export HB_DRIVE_D=/mnt/data

> (I'm not sure why filename and dir casing are broken into two options)

AFAIR it was Giancarlo decision and I think it was good choice. In many
programs lowering filename only is enough. In such case converting
also directory part may cause additional troubles when program uses
sth like curdir() + cFile. F.e. in CLIP it's not divided and lowering
filepath names is enabled by default, because RDDs internally use
absolute paths then it's impossible to open any DBF file if any of
parent directories contains upper letter.

Okey.

- Filename casing:
	-fn:l
	-fn:u
	-fn- (default)
- Directory casing (if we need it separately, like in RTL):
	-fd:l
	-fd:u
	-fd- (default)
- Filename space trimming:
	-fs
	-fs- (default)
- (?) Path separator:
	-fp:[char] (default: OS defined)
- Drive translation:
	-ft:A=/mnt/adrive
	-ft:C=/mnt/mycdrive
	-ft:A=/mnt/adrive;C=/mnt/mycdrive
	-ft- (default): turn off all drive translation

May I also suggest to change -r=<max> to -ppr:<max>?
(-r is something else in Clipper, and ':' is preferred
over '=' in this case, just like in '-undef:')

For drive "emulation" we will need some additional SETs
for RTL. (_SET_DRIVETRANS = "A=/mnt/adrive;C=/mnt/mycdrive")

It's a little bit more then single switch for file name lowering so
I will need more then two minutes but I'll add the above and commit
soon. I also think that pure: -fn -fd, -fp (without trailing '-')
should reset the switches to default state.

This will have to wait longer because I'd like to merge it with some
other modifications.

> May I also suggest to change -r=<max> to -ppr:<max>?

I can change it but we already have -p<path> and it may interact
with existing path settings. Of course it's very small chance that
someone will want to use "pr:<num>" as path name for .ppo/.ppt files.
We already don't allow to use "+" as .ppo/.ppt path for the same
reason.

This is minor modification but I'd like to know if I should make it
for -r: or for -ppr: - see above.

Fine but I'll do it later together with drive translation in compiler.

Hi,


Why are we using ":" instead of common "="?

Number of switches is growing and we will soon feel the lack of switch 
namespace. Perhaps we must review existing, maybe reserve some for 
future extensions. A long names could be a solution for rarely used 
switches, like it is in Linux?..
    --filename-case=l
    --dirname-case=u
etc.


Best regards,
Mindaugas

P.S. I see Przemek already committed this change, but we can think about 
it anyway :)

Okey, just let the "-" work too to be consistent with some other
switches.

You're right. Could you just change the separator to be ':'? (instead  
of '=')

Pls see above. We pretty run out of switch names, so maybe it's
time to introduce "--" as a native option system, since the
compatibility switch space is pretty much exhausted (and not very
optimal either).

Of course and no problem.

In Clipper there was no delimiter at all for this
purpose (which is a bad thing BTW), so I've opted
for ':', because '=' is used to give a value for
a #define ("-dMYDEF=something"). To be fully
"Clipper-like" though, I'd have choosen "-fnl",
"-fnu", but that is kinda ugly, IMO. '=' is also
used in drive translation for a Clipper-like purpose
here.

I agree that it's time to develop such a "GNU-compatible"
switch system, which is propely designed. Are there any
guidelines or any other documentation for this switch system?

Hi Teo,

Thanks for your commit.

As for bakefile, it looks good, but I wouldn't introduce
this tool dependency for Harbour this time. My reasons are:
1) this is a tool to be installed (not just an executable)
since it uses Python 2) this is another tool syntax to be
used and learned in Harbour and 3) last but least in Harbour
the GNU-make system is favored since it is supported all
over the project consistently. To ease the support of BC/VC
makefiles in contrib (that's where we have these repetitions),
we might add central lib making templates in /contrib/,
and use a more minimal local VC/BC makefile in each contrib
by including the central template. (it's worth noting though
that in case of contribs, maintenance of make files is
up to the contrib developers, at least in theory)

Marek is the master of makefiles, so maybe he can also help
in this separation of logic.

I've linked an example (work in progress) for libct. (it
doesn't work for VC, with an error I couldn't figure. Also,
proper, generic CLEAN should be added, and redundancy is
almost 100% yet.)

Probably because ":" is used by Clipper in application RT switches.

It's sth what I wanted to do long time ago. Also clean the situation with
// vers -- in RT switches. There is POSIX library used for such job called
getopt. To eliminate small differences between programs in options
parsing/decoding all programs should use getopt. Unfortunately Clipper
is not getopt compatible and we are trying to emulate Clipper behavior
so if we decide to use getopt then we will have to make some modifications
in option interpretation. Read sth about getopt (f.e.: man 3 getopt) and
you will find how it should look.

Well, long ago I suggested to use bakefile, but now I am
not sure it is worth the effort. The reason is very simple.
It is not widly known around the world, so there will be
serious problems if the maintainer leaves the project :(.

Thanks for kind words, but surely I cannot be described as a
"master" :). A "happy contributor" is much more adequate ;-).

A quick fix and cleanup is attached to this post :). Generic
CLEAN and INSTALL rules are yet to be done. DLL creation is
also yet to be done too.

But I am not sure this idea will fit for *all* contrib projects.
Well, most of them, where simple lib is created, will be ok, but
what about more complex contrib projects or projects which have
to have its own compilation flags for example ? Or projects which
have more targets than library ? They will have to have its own
makefiles either way ...

Hi,


I've looked to manual of getopt. It's not big job to implement our own 
version of getopt_long(). We can extend getopt_long() and implement 
//info and similar switches as an alternative to --info, if this is 
required for Clipper compatibility.
BTW, what switch prefix is used in linux builds? Are /n/w/es2 and //info 
a valid switches in Linux?

We'd need to think along the line to keep
everything we have so far, and implement
getopt (with -- prefixes = 'long' ?) as an
additional (parallel) switch system to not
break Clipper and Harbour compatibility.

The only collisions we have are indeed 'info',
'credits' (to some extent). We probably don't
need to touch their code.

'/n', '/w', '//info' should work under Linux,
but with a '-' prefix. I'm not sure if they work
without a space separator though (they do in
Windows).

Brgds,
Viktor

The real problem is not in long options (--) but with method of
parsing/interpretation passed parameters. If you have:
    getopt_long( argc, argv, "abc", long_options, &option_index )
then:
    -abc
means the same as:
    -a -b -c
but:
    -a-b-c
means:
    -a - -b - -c

Clipper with -es[012] or our -gc[0123], -go[0123], -gh, -gw,
-build, -credit, ... are not getopt compatible.
Additionally '-' which is not at the beginning of argument is not option
delimiter.
We cannot be getopt and Clipper compatible using only getopt()/getopt_long()
We can only try to use/emulate getopt_long_only()

> BTW, what switch prefix is used in linux builds? Are /n/w/es2 and //info

only '-', '/' is path separator and is not used in any options. The only
one program I know which accepts it is [x]Harbour in RT switches starting
with "//".

Can't we get around this problem by first gathering all '--'
options in a string array, and pass that to the standard
getopt*() functions?

I do not undeerstand.
Clipper's options are not getopt compatible. In getopt: -es2
means the same as: -e -s -2
We can (A) drop Clipper compatibility for POSIX platforms, redefine
switches and use getopt for parameters parsing (it will make happy
*nix users but not Clipper ones) or we can (B) use what we have and
introduce long switches with '--' prefix trying to keep getopt_long()
logic (f.e. special meaning for '=' and accepting minimal but unique
number of character from the option name). We can also (C) try to use
getopt_long_only() to replace our current logic and emulate as close
as possible to Clipper behavior.
Probably we will end with version (B).

Yes, we shouldn't drop the Clipper versions in any case. We need
to add another set of switches which can be used optionally, in
parallel with the Clipper ones, these switches should all begin
with '--'. This looks like (B) or (C) so far.

harbour -n --output=hello.c --gen=c -p hello.prg
(just an example as far as the -- switch names go)

What I was trying to suggest is to use the standard getopt functions
(instead of rewriting them), in a way that we first parse all our
cmd line arguments, parse all old ones just like now, and build another
list from those beginning with '--' and pass this list of string to
getopt*() functions. This seem like version (B).

Brgds,
Viktor

How about parsing out the Clipper compatible ones first and removing them from 
the mix. Then parse what's left with getopts.

Hi,


perhaps I'm missing something, but I see that gcc is also not compatible 
with getopt(). Options:  -Wall -lpcre -dumpversion are very similar to 
our -es2 -gc2.

So, we should try to be getopt() compatible for Harbour applications but 
not the compiler itself.


> harbour -n --output=hello.c --gen=c -p hello.prg
> (just an example as far as the -- switch names go)

For compiler we can continue to support -gc2 like switches with 
alternative [/|-]gc2 for windows. Long synonyms can also be used. But I 
suggest to change: -xx:yy to --xxxx=yy.

For application itself we need to support --info style options. It fits 
under getopt_long() restrictions. If we want to be Clipper compatible we 
can [//|--]info as an alternative for Windows.
//F:40 suppport perhaps is not necessary, because we do not have file 
count limitation. Do we?
The one thing should be changed: //gtstd to --terminal=std or similar.

I've mentioned writing our own getopt() because we need to support -gc2. 
We need to support standard long option behavior for windows, so we need 
getopt_long() anyway for this build.
The size of getopt() source is 65 lines of C code, see 
http://www.koders.com/c/fid034963469B932D9D87F91C86680EB08DB4DE9AA3.aspx
getopt_long() is a little bit longer. But I think filtering of getopt() 
incompatible options first and passing the rest to native getopt() will 
be longer than the our own getopt() itself.

Hm, I think we need to follow some sort of standard regardless of
the fact that gcc is violating it. (gcc has an extremely messy
switch "system" IMO)

Why change '-' switches? I don't think we need to change
anything we have, because we have them for a reason. For '--'
switches we can use '=', I haven't checked yet what is the
quasi standard in this regard, but if it is '=' we will
also use '=' of course; but only for the "long" switches.

To clear it up:

Now we have (some examples):
-gc2
-fn:l
We will have:
-gc2   AND --gen=clevel2
-fn:l  AND --fncase=lower

(just two examples for the long switches, we'll need
to think about the names some more)

So again, we will end up with _two_ alternate and parallel
switch system, and both can be used, or even mixed by the
users. This should be true for both the compiler and the
runtime.

This is not used in Harbour AFAIK.

We can change this, but --gtstd is fitting with the
long switch concept already.

Okey, I personally don't mind either solution as long as
the final result is okey. Maybe if we stick with the fully
standard getopt() there is a better chance to stay
consistent in the future though.

Both space and '=' seems to be used as switch name - value
separator in tools I've quickly checked.

Also see the 'wget --help' or 'make' for such a synonym
system I have in mind.

Question: How to implement -D using long getopt?
(and do we want to have a synonym for every "legacy" switch?)

--define='HELLO=HELLOVALUE' ?

Hello Viktor,

Attached are the makefiles generated from the bakefile xml script below, the 
compilers covered are:

* gnumake
* borland
* mingw (gcc)
* msvc

This is the bakefile script nedded to build the CT lib:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<makefile>

  <include file="../config/tmpl_hrb.bkl"/>

  <lib id="ct">
    <sources>
      $(fileList("*.prg"))
      $(fileList("*.c"))
      $(fileList("*.cpp"))
    </sources>
    <install-to>$(LIBDIR)</install-to>
  </lib>

</makefile>

However, I agree with Marek that this was primary intended to build some 
simple contrib lib's, but maybe the simpleness of the scripts and the syntax 
helps to build more complicated & combined targets, for example, the 
following bakefile xml script is the one that I use to build a win/linux 
application and produce gnumakefile/makefile.vc:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<makefile>

  <include file="config/tmpl_hrb.bkl"/>

If we use -gc2 and -es2 we can not be compatible with getopt().

: seems a little ugly, and it was introduced following Clipper's //F:40 
syntax, but we do not support F:40 anyway. Do we have more //X:Y or /X:Y 
switches in Clipper and Harbour?

OK, or --gen=c2


> -fn:l  AND --fncase=lower

In this case, I'd rather suggest to drop -fn and leave --fncase only, 
because I think this is rarely used switch used to compile wrong written 
source. It is better to reserve -f for something more useful, we have a 
lack of switch name space.

What switches do we have for applications? (Except, //info and //gtstd).
If these are the only, we can be fully getopt() compatible in Linux, and 
have only a small exception [//|--] for Windows.

Yes, great.

We could not be getopt() compatible in compiler (-gc2, -es2). So, can 
not use standard library for it.

Clipper support runtime parameter switches which are not passed to
application INIT and STARTUP functions/procedures.
They have the following syntax:
    //<opname>[:]value

We can find in Clipper documentation switches like:
    //BADCACHE
    //CGACURS
    //DYNF:<nHandles>
    //E:<nExpandedKbytes>
    //F:<nHandles>
    //INFO
    //NOIDLE
    //SWAPK:<nBytes>
    //SWAPPATH:'<path>'
    //TEMPPATH:'<path>'
    //X:<nKbytes>

There are also some undocumented switches, f.e.:
    //STDERR:<nHandle>

Probably some more but I do not know them.

Harbour supports the following Clipper switches:
    BOOL:
        //INFO
    NUMERIC:
        //STDERR:<nHandle>

additionally some of its own:
    BOOL:
        //BUILD
        //ERRGPF
    CHARACTER:
        //FLAGS:<cRTflags>
        //GT:<cGTname>
    NUMERIC:
        //CANCEL:<nCancelKey>
        //CANCELEX:<nCancelExtKey>

CANCEL  and CANCELEX are wrongly implemented as CHARACTER switches
and then converted to numbers but it's minor problem which can be
easy fixed. I haven't touched it so far because I plan to make some
modifications in GT code which will interact with them.

As you can see above we do not have //gtwin, //gtwvt, //gtstd, ... switches
but //gt:win, //gt:wvt, //gt:std, ... Just like in Clipper ':' can be
dropped (//F40 means the same as //F:40)

Why not?

We need to pass --myoption to getopt() and parse the non '--'

'=' is used for /DMYDEF=VALUE, so '=' is occupied
for something else, moreover ':' is used in lots of
other switches (see runtime too), we might even want
to support sometimes in the future. Point is: We've
replicated the switch concept of CA-Clipper (with
quite some work back then).

Yes, yes, it was just an example off the top of my head,
we need to define the new switch names properly if we
choose to go that way.

Yes, that's why we'd like to introduce the '--' ones.
If we have "--fncase", along with the getopt switch
system working, we can decide to remove some less-often
used '-' switches, but for now, these have no better place,
and I see no problem with having them in the "old" system.

If I'm thinking about it, I'd rather leave the runtime

solve here.

I'm writing this the fifth time: :)
getopt() gets two argument: argc, argv
Nothing can stop us to pass our own _filtered_ list of switches
to this function. Pseudo code:

main( argc, argv )
{
     int our_argc;
     char ** our_argv;

     filter_out_any_legacy_switches( argc, argv, &our_argc, &our_argv );

     getopt_long( our_argc, our_argv );

     free( our_argv );
}

Hi Marek,

Thanks.

For me it generated some strange results on CLEAN
(I'm running XP Pro SP2 English + Far Manager - which
went opensource last week!), so I'm getting lots of
errors, and this is probably because my "delone.bat"
looks like this on the inside:

---
"echo off"
'if "%1" == ""' goto skip
"if exist %1.c   del %1.c   > nul"
"if exist %1.obj del %1.obj > nul"
:skip
---

Note the quote chars.

I've changed clean.mak to this, and the problem went:

---
#**********************************************************
# CLEAN rule(s)
#**********************************************************

clean: doClean
Clean: doClean
CLEAN: doClean

doClean:
	echo echo off > delone.bat
	echo if "%1" == "" goto skip       >> delone.bat
	echo if exist %1.c   $(DEL) %1.c   >> delone.bat
	echo if exist %1.obj $(DEL) %1.obj >> delone.bat
	echo :skip                         >> delone.bat
	type &&!
call delone.bat $(LIB_OBJS:.obj=^
call delone.bat )
! > alldel.bat
	echo @echo off > delall.bat
	type alldel.bat >> delall.bat
	delall.bat
	if exist $(LIB_LIB) $(DEL) $(LIB_LIB) > nul
	$(DEL) alldel.bat > nul
	$(DEL) delone.bat > nul
	$(DEL) delall.bat > nul

#**********************************************************
---

I could also integrate clean.mak into common.mak, by appending
it at the end of the latter, and removing "!include ..\clean.mak
from makefile.*. I'm not sure if I've broken anything with it,
but it worked for me either for clean and build/install.

Brgds,
Viktor

Yes, you are right. It works under Necromander's Dos Navigator
but not under Far Manager.

I am not sure how it works for both bc and vc for you because the rule
to generate delall.bat is different for bc make.exe and vc nmake.exe.
I fixed it for both makefiles, so please redownload the zip again
and compare with your changes.

Nice (but still a new tool needed ;). What is in tmpl_hrb.bkl?

Marek helped to make the template based bc/vc makefiles
work, so we now have a system where only one file inside
/libct covers both VC and BC, and we still have our standard
GNU makefile there to support mingw/gcc and all other GCC
flavours.

Basically we only need two files inside /libct:
Makefile and common.mak, plus the two helper batch files.

See it in Marek's mail.

Brgds,
Viktor

In fact, the tool is not needed for a final user that attemps to build their 
libs/samples by using only the platform-specific makefile builded. It is only 
needed for the packager.

> What is in tmpl_hrb.bkl? 

It is just a one-place template where the specifics for the Harbour makefiles 
environment are.

Only two files are needed in order to build a platform-specific makefile:

1. tmpl_hrb.bkl
2. The script that contains the details; libs, exes, installation, compiler 
switches, linker switches, etc.

Is attached in case that you want to see how the internals are/can be 
specified.

Hi,

after looking to the numerous switches you've sent, I think the only 
think we can do is change cmdarg.c line 144 to:
      if( *pszPos == ':' || *pszPos == '=' )

This will allow to use --someswitch=value for Applications. Other 
modifications conflicts with Clipper compatibility.
hb_compChkCompilerSwitch requires some bigger modification to support 
this syntax.

Hi,


perhaps we understand "to be getopt() compatible" in a different way.
getopt() understands switch "-gc2" the same way as "-g -c -2". So,
supporting current -gc2 is incompability with getopt().

So, we need just to extend hb_compChkCompilerSwitch. I do not see any 
advantage of using getopt(), getopt_long(), getopt_long_only() here. 
Because:
1) we allow switch to start with /
2) -gc2 is different from -g -c -2
3) upper case switch is the same as lower case
4) space separator can be omitted between switches
5) we allow usage of ":" instead of "=" (//xxxxx:yy)
6) we allow to omit ":" (//xxxxxyy)

This makes switch syntax very different from getopt*().

I've been talking about adding "long" getopt from the
beginning, aka the '--' flavour of getopt.

There was no plan to fully switch to getopt in Harbour.

Yes, I know our current switch system is not getopt conform.
It is CA-Cl*pper conform.

This is why I wrote we're keeping the current switch system
(non-getopt) without any modifications, and we would
introduce a new (parallel) switch system using ("long") getopt,
for (and only for) the switches starting with '--'. For these
switches, we can use the getopt() function with no problem,
we just have to not pass our current (non-'--') switches to
this function.

(we don't _have to_ use the official getopt function, it's
just a plus.)

What am I missing? 8-/

Yes. It's my typo and should be fixed though hb_compExprMacroListLen()
is not longer used in current compiler code so it's not a problem.
But exactly the same mistake (probably due copy and past) I made in
include/hbexprb.c[1143] - here also it does not create problem due
to context but for sure it should be fixed. Many thanks for information.

The main reason to use getopt is giving exactly the same behavior
in parameters parsing in all programs installed in given system.
Even if we drop Clipper compatibility then for many users it will
be resonable if we wil use getopt. There are some differences in
getopt implementation between platforms and using native platform
tool resolves the problem. But if we want to keep current code
to parse and decode passed parameters then I do not see any reason
to call after this operation getopt. We will not give anything
valuable for users but we will need one additional (on some platforms)
library to build Harbour and it will be very hard to document the
exact behavior due to difference in getopt implementations. We should
add our own code for long options - it's just few lines. using GNU
getopt documentation to keep our implementation compatible with this
implementation. Merging to parameters parsers is IMHO very bad idea.

I was wondering about this the other day, but concluded
it was not a typo (at least not this way), but emulation
of CA-Cl*pper behaviour.

CA-Cl*pper compiler redirects normal output to stderr and
and errors to stdout.

Now the Harbour and C5.2 compiler outputs differ, while
they were identical previously.

In this respect the typo is in fflush() not in fprintf().

It's okey with me.

What we need to sort out now is the "standard" syntax
of the "getopt" option system. I couldn't find a good doc
about it (yet), but officially neither ':' nor '=' seem
to be supported as value separators (nevertheless tools
are using '=', maybe even ':'). The official way seems to be
"--option value" (which I personally don't like very much).
Still there is the question of "--define=HELLO=VALUE" (which
should be "--define HELLO=VALUE" probably and officially),
switch disabling (--option- ?), and handling spaces and
special chars in values (--dir "C:\my dir\" ?). Maybe more.

Brgds,
Viktor

No. They weren't. Clipper prints to stderr logo and to stdout
compilation output.
F.e.
    clipper t /m/n/w/es2

sends to stderr:

`--------------------------------------

We were not Clipper compatible and I do not see any reason to replicate
Clipper behavior at least in *nixes where stdout and stderr have precise
meaning and where all shells allows to easy redirect output. In stderr we
should have only warnings and error messages.

I've tested with the same command line ("* test /w /n"),
and it's different for me, and it wasn't before. I tested
under Windows.

(Now stderr output is empty in Harbour, while it has the
whole startup message plus "Code generation" in Clipper)

This now contains the startup info for Harbour
plus the warnings.

We were exactly compatible under Windows (apart from some
obvious output content differences), and we were not compatible
under Unixes.

That's fine, but if we want to make it "right" (as opposed to
compatible), we should also remove the #if from line 311, and
output to stderr on all platforms (not just on Unix).

Or, if we want to make it right only for Unixes, we need to add
such an #if for the hb_compOutStd() function too. (essentially
reversing stdout/stderr for non Unixes to stay C5.x compatible).

I have no personal opinion here, as I used to check both outputs
anyway. Technically, doing it "right" is better, but regarding
this issue we've been focusing on being compatible in the past.

Viktor

there is a global declaration of:

later in the program there are many functions which

and it might be confusing.

It might be a work in progress since s_info is not accessed by itself.

It's OK for me, but I do not know what is "opinion of the project". In 
some cases we try to be very precise compatible and not extend function 
behavior. Here we drop compatibility.

No. '=' is official separator between long option and its value.

   Long  option  names may be abbreviated if the abbreviation
   is unique or is an exact match for some defined option.  A
   long  option may take a parameter, of the form --arg=param
   or --arg param.

I do not see any problem here. The name of option is taken from
"--" to '=' or '\0'. If it's '=' then <param> is taken from '='
to the end of arg else non optional <param> is always taken from
next arg and optional only if the next arg does not start with
option separator. Such situation (optional value starting with
option separator) is very good example why '=' is needed.
Any internal '=' inside <param> are unimportant.
F.e.:
    proc main()
    ? 1 DEF 2
    return

    clipper x -n -p -dDEF==

works just like:

    harbour x -n -p -dDEF==

Both Clipper and Harbour allows to define even longer definitions, f.e.:
    harbour x -n -p -dDEF=+3=+2+
but Clipper left only first token ('+' in this example) as DEF value.
IMHO it's a bug and I didn't replicated it intentionally. Anyhow in
Harbour value is parsed to first option delimiter what is IMHO also
wrong and should be eliminated. The same problem was with -o option
and it was not possible to use filenames with '-' in *nixes - I fixed
it and the same should be done with for -d.

So Clipper results are the same as mine and as you can see
we were not Clipper compatible before my modification.
In Harbour stderr can be empty if you are using Dos/Windows
because we have:

#if defined( OS_UNIX_COMPATIBLE )
    fprintf( stderr, "%s", szMessage ); fflush( stderr );
#else
    fprintf( stdout, "%s", szMessage ); fflush( stdout );
#endif

It's a code I keep from the beginning but it was not my
decision. I guess that someone who was redirecting stdout
to file in DOS/Windows command.com needed it because command.com
does not allow to redirect stderr.
I'm leaving decision about keeping this behavior to Windows/DOS
users. IMHO the *unix like behavior is the best one.

Only in current DOS/Windows builds - see above.
In Linux I have in stderr:

I think you should look at source code because you are wrong.
Or better please make real test and also check were #error and
#stdout were redirected. F.e before my commit for this code:
    proc main()
    @
    #error error-msg
    #stdout stdout-msg
    return

In short words. This were exactly reverted results from current

Do it what you only want in DOS/Windows builds but please left
untouched the *nix ones. I'm not interesting in keeping workarounds
for command.com limitation in Linux builds.
As I can see you want to revert hb_compOutStd() output so instead of:

         fprintf( stderr, "%s", szMessage ); fflush( stdout );

we will have:

    #if defined( OS_UNIX_COMPATIBLE )
         fprintf( stdout, "%s", szMessage ); fflush( stdout );
    #else
         fprintf( stderr, "%s", szMessage ); fflush( stderr );
    #endif

If you like it then please do it. We only have to document that
in Dos/Windows builds error messages are send to STDOUT and
normal output to STDERR.
But if you want to be Clipper compatible (and I said we never were)
then you will have to check the places where messages are generated
and update them so compilation output will not be divided to stdout
and stderr but always redirected to stdout and other messages like
startup logo or usage info to stderr. But please left the *nixes
build unchanged. All *nix users used to redirect stderr to file by
simple:
    2> error.log
to easy find all warnings and error messages and it's very useful
feature. And because even in DOS/Windows is possible to redirect
stderr using some other command interpreters/shells then maybe you
should think also about using stderr in hb_compOutErr() like in
*nixes. I suggest such modification but I'm leaving the decision
to you and other DOS/Windows users.

Sorry, I still don't see why would we drop
any compatibility. If we need to drop any
compatibility (meaning any switch we currently
have and how we have), I'm against this addition.

Either with or without standard getopt() function
this problem is perfectly doable however IMO. If
we won't be able to use "standard getopt()", just
replicate its functionality, it's perfectly okey.

Okey. So '=' is optional, good.

Okey, this is good.

What is the std way in "getopt" to explicitly turn off a boolean switch?

Not quite.

1) Clipper          : heading -> err  warnings -> out
2) Old Harbour (Win): heading -> err  warnings -> out
3) Now Harbour (Win): heading -> out  warnings -> out (!)
4) Old Harbour (Lin): heading -> err  warnings -> err (by source code)
5) Now Harbour (Lin): heading -> out  warnings -> err (by source code)

See here the whole stuff (for Windows):

Do you think I didn't? I almost fixed it a few weeks ago (in the

Przemek come on, I don't want to revert anything, I wrote two
suggestions to clear up the current non-fully-right and not even
compatible situation, _none of them_ changes the _Unix_ behaviour.
Please read more carefully.

I've never argued about having errors on stderr being a bad thing
(I've said it's the _right_ thing actually), all I was pointing
to that we're now incompatible and/or inconsistent, and we are.

As I wrote I don't personally care about incompatibility here,
all I'm saying is that _for consistency_ we choose 1) either to refix
DOS/Windows output, or 2) switch to the (non-compatible) Unix method
for DOS/Windows too.

1) Needs this #if to be removed (syncing DOS/Windows with Unix,  
leaving Unix as it is)
2) Needs a new #if for stdout (leaving Unix as it is)

I would choose 1)

Viktor

See: "before my commit" above ;-)
These are results from DOS Harbour build created from source
code before my last commit. I know current results in DOS/Windows
build and rest of my message were about your choices in future
modifications of this behavior which is for sure wrong.

So we both have the same problem ;-)

I'm afraid you missed one important thing. I updated *nix builds so
it sends error and warning messages to stderr and rest to stdout.
Just like in all other compilers I have in my system so now it's possible
to redirect output from make files using different compilers and tools
in the same way.
This modification changed DOS/Windows build where the error output was
reverted. Error and warning massages where sent to STDOUT and rest to
STDERR. Please note that it was not Clipper compatible because Clipper
does not divide message for error/warning ones and rest. 
If you want to keep previous Harbour behavior in DOS/Windows builds then
please do it. I do not like it because it will break standard compiler
behavior in MSYS and BASH-DJGPP so it will not be possible to make sth
like:
    make 2> error.log
and catch all error and warning messages from MAKE, Harbour, GCC and
any other tools used in build process in one file but I use DOS and
Windows builds very seldom so I can leave with it. For me Clipper
behavior is nothing more then workaround for missing 2> redirecting
in command.com so Clipper authors make it in a way where all compilation
messages (errors, warnings, and standard informations) where redirected
to file and user can later check it. Now even in DOS/Windows it's not a
problem to find command interpreter or shell which will allow to redirect
separately stdout and stderr in single or different files.

Only in DOS/Windows build. Please update them in the way you like.
This is sth what I try to say ;-)
I send you all necessary information and tried to present possible
choices. I'm leaving the decision for you.

So we have the same opinion :-).
Can you remove this #if from hb_compOutErr() and leave only:

    fprintf( stderr, "%s", szMessage ); fflush( stderr );

BTW some users may still want to use all command.com so maybe we
should add an option to redirect stderr to stdout. If you will
chose one then please inform me and I'll implement it.

I think that Phil intentionally decide to keep all information about
debugger state in one structure so it's not "work in progress" but
I agree that using the same name is dangerous because it may hide
some typos so I'll change the static 'info' name to 's_pInfo' and
at the begining of hb_dbgEntry() I'll add:
   HB_DEBUGINFO *info = s_pInfo;

Okey, this is done already, and will go with my next commit.

Thanks for the switch, as for the name I'd opt to use
what we already have for the runtime: [//|--]stderr[:|=]<number>
(but extended with the '--' and '=' support). Tell me if
this is too generic, I'll come up with a "friendlier" name.

Well, after some filtering the lint log is still over 20,000 lines!

Here are just an example of the Info and Warning types I get:

Warning 572: Excessive shift value (precision 3 shifted right by 8)
Info 701: Shift left of signed quantity (int)
Info 702: Shift right of signed quantity (int)

Info 826: Suspicious pointer-to-pointer conversion (area too small)

The list is so huge, there is not much point to automatically
report it all, sending you to revalidate working code.

Here is something that might be a problem:

Such reporting over some limits stops to be usable though
probably some of the above warnings can be cleaned - anyhow
it should be done carefully to avoid bug introducing by wrong
casting - casting only to pacify warning messages without deeper
knowledge about code conditions is asking for troubles and only
hides wrong code. In some spare time I can make some cleanups.
What is the size of compressed log?

In this case it's false alarm and the code is correct.

I know.

The zip is about 140KB for common, compiler, debug, pp, rtl and vm.
There are many cases were lint falsely warn about null pointer usage
but out code is guarded with flags which are not known to lint.
Some of the errors are missing #define in my lint configuration.
I'll try tomorrow to create a cleaner logs and upload them for
inspection.

Hi,


I want to have i18n support in the Harbour. We need compiler and library 
support for this. What are propositions for function names/syntax: 
gettext(), HB_GetText(), i18n(), HB_i18n() or some other? We can use C 
style define also:
#define _(<msgid>) => HB_somename(<msgid>)

Harbour allows variable name of parameters, so several gettext library 
functions can be joined. For example, I found useful to join
    char *gettext(char *msgid)
    char *pgettext(char *msgctxt, char *msgid)
to
     HB_somename( cMsgId [, cMsgCtxt] )


Best regards,
Mindaugas

The gettext API has some other functions, so I think we'd
need to reserve a separate namespace for them for the
Harbour level, like:

hb_gettext_bindtextdomain()
hb_gettext_textdomain()
hb_gettext_gettext()
hb_gettext_dgettext()
hb_gettext_ngettext()
hb_gettext_dngettext()
(and some more for explicit codepage conversion)

The names should definitely start with hb_ and I'd
prefer to add a subspace for this API:

hb_gettext_*()
hb_gtxt_*()
hb_gtx_*()
hb_nat_*() (disadvantage: can be other i18n implementations in the  
future)
hb_i18n_*() (disadvantage: can be other i18n implementations in the  
future, harder to type)
hb_gt_*() (disadvantage: similar already used by GT subsystem)

(I personally prefer hb_gettext_*())

To make it easy for Harbour programs to access the most
common API call, we can also add a hb_gettext() as a synonym
for hb_gettext_gettext(), but in most cases this will be
called by the _() define anyway.

On the C level I think we should use it normally (like pcre*()),
but if extend it locally, we should use hb_gettext_*() on
the C level too.

The _() #define violates our namespace (C and Harbour level), but
it's quite a standard, so we probably don't do too much harm if we
introduce it as is. The only potential problem here is there might
be other i18n tools in the future (but then, this #define can be
remapped).

Brgds,
Viktor

In practice the same as in DEVEL. Just simply I decided that porting only
chosen fixes is potentially more dangerous then whole modules tested by
other Harbour developers. Manual updating can be always source of stupid
mistakes and typos. In last half year we haven't any "revolutionary"
modifications. Now I'd like to release beta-4 ASAP so I synced branches.
I think it's time to release version 1.0 AFAIK only TBROWSE class needs
some modifications/fixes and it should be our priority. I do not know
what Viktor wants to add yet but I think that it's a good time to
release BETA4.

It was a process which took me few days and still some things are not
synced. I planed to announce it when I finish.

We are in a beta. New features need to wait until we get done with the beta.

Hi,


we must discuss before adding any new features, so beta is also good for 
this :)

But if anyone want to commit something new, we have HEAD for development 
and /branches/beta1 for beta. Don't we?

In theory, we do. But in practice it has not worked that way, so I'd like to 
limit new features until we get 1.0 out the door. It won't help to start them 
now and put them off, because it just distracts the developers and makes 1.0 
further away.

The sooner 1.0 is out the door, the sooner all kinds of new code will be 
embraced.

Hello Everybody

I need to know how to compile and link Harbour appln for PocketPC/WinCE .

I will be using GTWVT and Borland 5.5. 

I complied the test/wcecon.prg. It runs fine on XP. But when loaded on
Verizon cell phone, it reported that "this is not a PocketPC application". 
What I am doing wrong.

I was using the standard Harbour build though "make_b32".

Well, I am more likely looking for a grammar definition
which will properly describe Harbour's sources. It does
not have to be 100% compatible with Clipper's behavior.

It depends :). From my "lack of knowledge"
point of view it makes "perfect sense" ;-).

Anyway,

I played around with few parsers available on a net and
I found that GOLD parser is the one I like the most. It
has the most clean "syntax" in defining grammars. Terminals
are cleanly separated from Nonterminals. Grammars are "self
contained" - "Lexx" like tools are not required ( I hope :) ).
GOLD does not require to embed your source code directly
into the grammar. Grammars are completely independent of
any implementation language or platform. GOLD also has an
"Import YACC grammar" feature, which I used to import
harbour/xharbour grammar files.

I imported Harbour and Xharbour grammar definition files
into GOLD and got "a first step" file(s) in creating fully
independent definition of "Harbour's syntax". "A first step"
means that the created files are not complete because hb/xh
use "Lexx" for tokenizing. So terminals like NUM_LONG, LINE
etc. are not defined. I am in a process of "learning" how
they should be defined in GOLD :).

Importing hb/xh grammar definition files into GOLD showed
me that xh definition is more clear than hb one. Xh import
required very few simplifications/corrections to a grammar
file, in contrast to hb import where I had to perform more
simplifications/corrections to grammar file to succesfully
import it.

The generated files are available at :
  http://republika.pl/hbfltk/grammar.zip
in case anyone is interested :).

The above link contains two more files : JavaScript.grm and
VBScript.grm. They are the examples of what I would like to
get for Harbour grammar :).

In practice no.
For few months I was updating separately DEVEL and BETA branch but
because I was the only one person who made it and I do not have
enough time to make the same modifications twice and also well
test BETA branch because only few people use it then I decided
to simply sync both branches - sorry but I cannot do everything
myself, I also have my private life ;-).

Now I want to release 1.0 ASAP. We need BETA4 and then RC1.
The only one problem with current core code is TBROWSE class which
should be updated/fixed yet. Maybe some other minor problems with TGET
or similar classes exist but even if then they will be rather small
things easy to updated by nearly each developer.
In last months we have general code cleanup and for sure it was very
good and important thing but we can do such modification even for year
or more. I hope Phil will give us some roadmap for 1.0 release.

I'll send my current TBROWSE work-in-progress (later today),
I simply couldn't dedicate the amount of time for this as
I wanted to.

Displaying should be about okey, but it has some bugs,
vertical, horizontal navigation is definitely a todo.

As for the release, I have a few points to clear up before:

- What about the "dirty" extensions? (now most of them
   guarded with HB_EXTENSION)
   We have some really important base functions which have
   such extensions, and I'm not sure if this is good: AT(), *TRIM(),
   etc.
   My vote would be to disable all of them which belong
   to documented CA-Cl*pper function calls, or disable HB_EXTENSION
   by default.
- Few namespace violations: GTI_*, GFX_*
   (xhb compatibility is an issue here, but otherwise these
   are fixable)
- Collision with Windows types, and the few "hacks" we use
   to get around that.
   (3rd party compatibility is an issue, which can resolve
   with some #define tricks)
   This is a very important issue IMO.

This is probably our last chance to fix these without breaking
compatibility later.

I'd also like to cleanup contrib from things that are obsolete
don't work or incomplete: dot, delphi, tprepro, ole?, hb_struc?

Plus I'd like to move "/samples" inside "/contrib".

Brgds,
Viktor

AFAIK it's impossible. BCC55 can generate only x86@32 binaries.
You cannot create binaries for ARM processors using this compiler.

You created x86@32 binaries for Win32. Not ARM binaries for WinCE/MB

> I was using the standard Harbour build though "make_b32".

You will have to change C compiler and use one which supports ARM
processors and linker which can create WinCE binaries. You can
try MSVC, POCC or POGCC, CeGCC and probably others I haven't tested.
My tests with new POCC version shows that this compiler has some
problems/bugs when generate ARM binaries so probably it's not good
choice today. POGCC was not developed for long time. So you should
chose between MSVC and CeGCC. I've chosen CeGCC with MinGW RTL
(MinGW-CE). See http://cegcc.sourceforge.net/
It can be installed on x86 Windows and Linux and then you can
create PocketPC(ARM)-WinCE binaries. Such binaries cannot be
executed on x86 computers natively but you can install PocketPC
emulator (Virtual Machine) and test them and of course you can
copy them to your mobile device controlled by WinCE and execute.
If you decide to use MinGW-CE then I suggest to use *nix like
shell environment, f.e. MSYS in Windows. In such case you will be
able to use hb* scripts updated for this compiler. If you are using
RPM based Linux distribution then creating WinCE binaries is very
easy. Run ./make_rpm.sh from non root account and in few minutes
in ${HOME}/RPM/RPMS/<arch>/ you will have ready to install RPMs
with native harbour build. Then run ./make_rpmce.sh and it will
create RPM with Harbour binaries for PocketPC in the same directory.
Install new RPMs using root account and now you can easy create
PocketPC binaries. For .prg compilation use hbcecmp and for linking
hbcelnk. See /usr/share/doc/harbour-ce-1.1.1/README.RPM for detail
description of hbce* scripts. They are working in exactly the same
way as normal hb* scripts which are used for standard native builds.
If you want to compile and link .prg file in one command then use
hbcemk. F.e.:
    hbcemk -n -w -es2 -gtwvt wcecon

If you will create binaries linked with harbour shared library
(harbour.dll), f.e. by:
    hbcemk -n -w -es2 -gtwvt wcecon -shared

then please remember that you will have to copy to your PocketPC
also harbour.dll (you will find it in /usr/lib/harbour-ce).

HTH.

best regards,
Przemek

ps. For Linux users who want to easy create Win32 binaries and
    are using RPM based distributions I'll add soon make_rpmw32.sh
    which will create RPM with Harbour binaries for Windows and
    hbw* scripts.

  * harbour/make_xmingw.sh

  + harbour/make_rpmw32.sh
  + harbour/harbour-w32-spec
    + added script to build RPMs with cross build of Harbour for MS-Windows
      using MinGW32 cross compiler.
      make_rpmw32.sh should create harbour-w32-<ver>.i[345]86.rpm which
      can be installed with platform native harbour RPMs.
      This RPM contains Harbour libraries compiled for Win32 and
      set of hbw* scripts which should be used instead of standard hb*
      ones to create MS-Windows binaries. It means that you can create
      standard Linux binaries and MS-Windows binaries in the same session
      without setting/changing any additional environment variables, f.e:
         hbmk -n -w -es2 test.prg
      will create Linux binaries and:
         hbwmk -n -w -es2 test.prg
      will create binaries for MS-Windows.
      Please also remember that if you create and install RPMs with Harbour
      for WinCE/PocketPC (make_rpmce.sh) then hbce* scripts will create
      WinCE/PocketPC binaries, f.e.:

Yes but it will need a lot of modifications because we cannot make
any mechanical S&R. Some types should be updated but some other not.
Also we should add separated types for string and array lengths to
resolve the problem introduced by XP64 where [U]LONG is 32 bit integer
what limits maximum string item size on such platform. If you look at
the code then you will find also that it will be good to replace some
of USHORT variables by dedicated types. F.e. [x]Harbour can have only
56535 symbols. In normal programs it's not a problem at all but each
function, memvar and field needs symbol. It means that we cannot open
tables where field were create in some loop. F.e. it's enough to create
66 DBFs with 1000 unique field names and HVM will crash trying to open
them. This also should be fixed and it's IMHO even more important then
name space conflicts. To not repeat the work we should group such
modifications. But if we start to make it now then it will take us few
weeks and then it will have to be extensively tested. I can easy find
also other things I wanted to change before 1.0 release but if we try
to make all of them then 2008 will be year of such modifications.

> This is probably our last chance to fix these without breaking

Probably but I do not believe we will ever have finished such
modifications if we'll begin to dig really deep. If you see that
sth can be done in reasonable time then please do it. I also
plan to commit few helper functions but I try to not make any
bigger modifications in core code for really long time. I want
to release 1.0 so I can work on 1.1.
IMHO we should only announce now that probably version 1.2 will not
be binary compatible with 1.0 in many places. That's all. I recently
ported some of free GUI libraries to WinCE and as I can see even now
most of their code should be seriously cleaned/fixed. Now I plan to
work on some simple GUI lib for Windows to make it also an example
for other developers how some things can be resolved or should be written.
If it will be new code (not one of existing GUI lib) then IMHO it should
contrib project. Anyhow it will take long time to clean some things and
I do not think it should stop us with final 1.0.

       uses the same output on non-Unix platforms as on Unixes.
       With Przemek's previous and now this change, the

       (messages to stdout, warnings/errors to stderr), 
       instead of being more or less CA-Cl*pper compatible.

Subject: [Harbour] WinCE port with MSVC 8.0
Message-ID: <47349DEB.8000109@interia.pl>

Hi Przemek & Viktor,

I would like to commit a makefile and some small fixes
required for Harbour/WinCE compiled using MSVC 8.0 (from
Visual Stufio 2005).

However there is one big problem - MSVC for WinCE does not
have some header files required by Harbour. The problem
affects five header files. The only one fix I can think of
is to include those files in Harbour.

At this link < http://republika.pl/hbfltk/msvc_wce.zip >,
you have all files which I would like to commit. Please
look at a directory include/hbwince. There are few header
files, required to succesfully compile Harbour for WinCE
using MSVC. Five of them are copyrighted by Microsoft,
but they seem to be available as "Public".

I'd like to hear your opinion regarding this issue.

It has so little traffic I never reinstated it. I'll start it up again when we

It is more than dangerous to include any other
copyrighted material inside Harbour IMO. So, I think
we should solve this in some other ways, either
by removing these header file requirements from
Harbour, or by providing links for users to get
those headers from a legal source.

I tend to think I was right, when I told that
WINCE is not just a sub-type of WIN32, but a
wholly different platform :( Maybe it's time to
add HB_OS_WIN_CE as it is starting to look a bit messy,
with all these defines controlling WinCE specific
sources.

Do you think it is possible to integrate makefile.ce
into makefile.vc (and make_ce.bat into make_vc)? I'm
asking because it would be best to avoid duplicating
our makefiles, and if WinCE ARM target would be a
sub-option inside the VC build system, just like 64bit.

If this is impossible, I think the names should be:
make_vcce.bat and makefile.vcce (I know they are long,
but we've already broken this old rule, and 8.3
filesystems are so much the past anyway, especially
for the VC/CE platforms.)

Viktor

Your suggestion brought one another solution to my
mind :). We can take those files from MingW distribution.
And this should be perfectly OK. Przemek ?

Well, I am not a right person to discuss this issue :).

Unfortunately the answer is IMO "no". There are too many
differences between normal MSVC and MSVC for WinCE. Even
Microsoft divides it into two (and in fact into more than
two) different compilers, although they all are a part of
one "package" - VS2005. Besides this, ARM is only one of
pissible "targets". Current Makefile.ce does not allow to
compiler for other processors, but it is rather easy job
to do.

I hate extensions longer than 3 chars ;-). make_vcce.bat
is ok, but makefile.vcce looks terribly. But I see your
POV and I tend to agree :).

I can understand your point, but I think aesthetics is lower
priority here than namespace separation. "GTI_*" might well be
used anywhere in the millions of lines of Clipper code. DBI_
on the other hand was already defined by CA (just like _SET_*),
so we're at least not inventing a _new_ prefix here, just extending
some existing ones. Because of that, chances are very low that
_applications_ will collide with them (in other words, probably
no applications defined _SET_MYSETTING, but any of them could
use GTI_ANYTHING).

(With other Clipper compilers though, this can still easily
become a problem, it's enough to compare the _SET_* #defines
through xhb, Harbour and XPP)

I can help in the process, but I'd definitely need your
help to define the rules first. (1) which new types do we need,
2) with what names, and 3) which are the rules to change
old types to new types in the code)

Good, good. Problem is, almost all basic API definitions will
have to change :( That's why I think we should at least convert
our public APIs now, to not cause a shock later.)

As for the rest, I'll start to the modifications. I might
have some questions along the process, though :)

Hm, depends on their license I guess. Might be.

Isn't there any chance to get rid of these dependencies?

I hate to hear this :) but you must be right, so let's
have it this way.

Yet another fact BTW that signals that WinCE is a wholly
different platform (at least MS managed to cut some
corners to break it well..).

Actually I'd prefer to keep the original extensions
for makefiles (and for every files, that's why we have
standard(ish) extensions after all), so ideally I'd name
them:

make_b32.mak
make_vc.mak
make_vcce.mak
make_gcc.mak
common.mak

They'd align beautifully with their own batch files,
and their extension would finally signal file-type,
not some other info.

What do you think?

(BTW, we'd need make_gcc.bat I guess)

Viktor

Subject: [Harbour] HB_NO_TRACE problem
Message-ID: <00c701c82301$d54f90c0$ca64fea9@emag>

Dear friends, if I build Harbour using HB_NO_TRACE then it GPFs in my 
Harbour/FWH samples like this:

#include "Fivewin.ch"


FUNCTION MAIN()

    LOCAL oWnd

    DEFINE WINDOW oWnd

    DEFINE BUTTONBAR OF oWnd

    DEFINE BUTTON;
           OF oWnd:oBar

    ACTIVATE WINDOW oWnd

    RETURN NIL

If you want to test it then please try to move the mouse over the button on 
the toolbar.

Without HB_NO_TRACE all is fine.

Hi all,

Just read this a minute ago:

Should we implement this flag in our file/dir existance check

(I think we should)

I just tested MSVC/WinCE with header files taken from MingW
and everything works ok. So the licence from MingW/win32api
should be checked. And since I am not an licence expert I'd
like to hear others (Przemek?, Phil?, anyone?) opinions on
this subject.

> Isn't there any chance to get rid of these dependencies?

I have too limited knowledge to give you any definitive
answer :(. I guess Przemek/Ryszard are the "right" persons.

I like this idea ! Really ! :).

I don't think so. make_gcc.sh/makefile.gc is designed
to work using MSYS/CYGWIN environment under Windows.
I doubt it will work with standard command.com/cmd.exe.

Files from MingW/win32api are "public domain" :).  They contain
the following note :

  * This file has no copyright assigned and is placed in the Public Domain.
  * This file is a part of the mingw-runtime package.
  * No warranty is given; refer to the file DISCLAIMER within the package.

Subject: [Harbour] Harbour 1.0 Timeline.
Message-ID: <200711100023.52365.philb@philb.us>

Here is the timeline I proposed about a year ago. Notice that I did not 
propose dates, but I did propose a method and it's a method that I think we 
have all seen time and again.

We do alpha releases until the code base is as complete as possible.

We do beta releases until the bugs are fixed as much as possible.

We do Release Candidates until there are very few bugs reported.

Personally I don't care if this takes a year or two months. I'd much prefer 
that it gets done right instead of quickly.

May I ask you why you removed "set COPYCMD=/Y" hack in
make_b32.bat and make_vc.bat ? I guess Chen will not
be very happy because of this ( nor I am too ;-) ).

Hi Marek,

Okey, I've just now understood what COPYCMD really
does. I removed because I thought this envvar is
supposed to be used by the makefiles explicitly,
not something internal to COPY.

To avoid this hack, is there any downside in using
'XCOPY /Y'? or to delete target files before the
copy and avoid using /Y in the COPY command?

Brgds,
Viktor

BTW (I cannot answer my own CHANGELOG mails, as I'm not getting
them here), if someone have some time to burn, it would be great
to assign the TOFIXes in my commit:

- pgsql not compiling at all
- directx not compiling under MSVC
- rdd_ads / MSVC now needs the GNU 'sed' tool
   and 'exports.sed' (not in repository) to create
   a .lib from ace32.dll.
   Is there any way to get around that?
   (if there is no way, I may upload this sed support file)

Marek, maybe a generic .def -> .lib rule in
contrib make templates would also be good. (it's
now solved in the batch files). Would be great if
you could help.

Fixes are coming for pdflib and msql.

Brgds,
Viktor

"COPYCMD" *is* a proper hack for *all* Windows versions.
"XCOPY /Y" will not work on WinNT and I guess Win95/98.

To delete target files you would have to have a list
of files to delete. Otherwise you could delete user's
files placed in destination directories. And this can
bring problems with a command line length on some Win
versions I guess.

"COPYCMD" is the best way to go. Thanks Chen for
bringing this solution to my atttention :).

also please add #include "hbapiitm.h" into win32.c and replace in
contrib/hgf/win32/make_b32.mak
  bcc32 $(CLIBFLAGS) -DHB_API_MACROS  -c -O2 -I$(INCLUDE_DIR) -o$@ $<

Hi,


what do you mean "implement this flag"? There is no any flag. There is 
error ERROR_DELETE_PENDING on file open operation (CreateFile() function 
call).

The article does not suggests any good solution, but I do not see a big 
problem here. If FileExists() returns true, it does not mean that we are 
guaranteed to open file without error. We should check FOPEN() for 
success anyway, because file could be opened in exclusive mode, file 
could be renamed or deleted by other process in time between our 
FileExists() and FOPEN() calls. So, ERROR_DELETE_PENDING is only one of 
the possible errors in this situation. I do not think we could or should 
try to avoid it.


Best regards,
Mindaugas

Hello developers,

Can someone help me understand how to use hb_evalBlock0?  This function 
is defined in source/vm/eval.c, and appears to be a C function for 
evaluating a Harbour code block with no parameters.  Within Harbour, is 
used only in the same file, a few lines down, in the definition of the 
Harbour function HB_FORNEXT, which appears to be broken because of a 
problem retrieving the return value of a code block evaluated with 
hb_evalBlock0.

The syntax for HB_FORNEXT is given as HB_FORNEXT(nStart, nEnd | bEnd, 
bCode, nStep).  When bEnd is used, HB_FORNEXT calls hb_evalBlock0, 
apparently to determine whether to exit the loop.  But actually, the 
loop always exits - it never evaluates bCode.  For instance, if we 
assign the following:

cStr := ''
bStr := {|nVal| cStr += LTRIM(STR(nVal)) + '/'}

and then separately evaluate HB_FORNEXT(1, {|| .N.}, bStr) and 
HB_FORNEXT(1, {|| .Y.}, bStr), cStr is empty both times.

HB_FORNEXT uses the code

         hb_evalBlock0( pEndBlock );
         lEnd = hb_parnl( -1 );

to evaluate bEnd.  This always seems return false.  I tried changing 
hb_parnl to hb_parl, but then it always goes through the loop once, 
again regardless of the value of bEnd.

However, in the following function,

HB_FUNC( EVALLOGICALBLOCK )
{
  PHB_ITEM  pWaitProc = hb_param( 1, HB_IT_BLOCK );
  hb_evalBlock0( pWaitProc );
  hb_retl( hb_parl( -1 ) );
}

the correct value is returned. 

I would like to use hb_evalBlock in my own function.  Any ideas for how 
can I get the correct value?

Kevin

I don't think it is a good way to resolve the problem the
way you try to reslove it. First of all, it's an end user
responsibility to have ace32.dll and a coresponding import
library ace32.lib for MSVC. Although RDD ADS depends on an
import library we are in no way responsible for providing
such a library. Note that build process fails if an end
user does not have ace32.dll.
Secondly, introducing dependency on sed is plainly wrong
way to go. Really few people are having sed on their machines.
And really few will want to install it.

I would take a different aproach. At this URL :
   http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/1997-04/msg00221.html
there is a free C code for impdef.exe utility (public domain)
which generates DEF files usable with MSVC. I suggest to
include this C file into Harbour under yet contrib directory
or under utils directory and to build this utility when
needed (e.i. for MSVC/RDDADS)

Hi,


I see no problem here, to change to ULONG. This change affects uiSymNum 
member of HB_DYNS and static/local variables of dynsym.c. The only place 
uiSymNum is used is a single function in classes.c module. If all these 
classes buckets will work with ulSymNum, I can do this change.

Should this change be done now or after release?


Best regards,
Mindaugas

Message-ID: <4735FDE8.706@kevincarmody.com>

Hello developers,

Can someone help me understand how to use hb_evalBlock0?  This function 
is defined in source/vm/eval.c, and appears to be a C function for 
evaluating a Harbour code block with no parameters.  Within Harbour, it 
is used only in the same file, a few lines down, in the definition of 
the Harbour function HB_FORNEXT, which appears to be broken because of a 
problem using hb_evalBlock0.

The syntax for HB_FORNEXT is given as HB_FORNEXT(nStart, nEnd | bEnd, 
bCode, nStep).  When bEnd is used, HB_FORNEXT calls hb_evalBlock0, 
apparently to determine whether to exit the loop.  But actually, the 
loop always exits immediately - it never evaluates bCode.  For instance, 
if we assign the following:

cStr := ''
bStr := {|nVal| cStr += LTRIM(STR(nVal)) + '/'}

and then separately evaluate HB_FORNEXT(1, {|| .N.}, bStr) and 
HB_FORNEXT(1, {|| .Y.}, bStr), cStr is empty both times.

HB_FORNEXT uses the code

         hb_evalBlock0( pEndBlock );
         lEnd = hb_parnl( -1 );

to evaluate bEnd.  This always seems return false.  I tried changing 
hb_parnl to hb_parl, but then it always goes through the loop once, 
again regardless of the value of bEnd.

However, in the following function,

HB_FUNC( EVALLOGICALBLOCK )
{
  PHB_ITEM  pWaitProc = hb_param( 1, HB_IT_BLOCK );
  hb_evalBlock0( pWaitProc );
  hb_retl( hb_parl( -1 ) );
}

the correct value is returned. 

I would like to use hb_evalBlock in my own function.  Any ideas for how 
can I get the correct value? TIA for your help.

Kevin

Thanks, useful to see it, I might use this
locally. I was looking at Jam back then BTW.

Pls check the committed non-GNU BC/VC makefile changes,
redundency is now minimal (apart from the .bat files,
which are exactly the same for most contribs). And
we still can use the GNU make files for all compilers.

The new make files are not yet used in: /contrib/hgf
(it's one level deeper, and this is generalized yet),
not fully in /contrib/hbzip (we'd need .dll support),
and not at all in /contrib/examples (these are apps,
not libs).

Brgds,
Viktor

Yes it works and I think it is more correct for contrib. 
Also we need to rename CLASS HBMenuItem ( from contrib\hgf\gtk\menuitem.prg,
contrib\hgf\win32\menuitem.prg, contrib\hgf\os2pm\tmenuitm.prg,
contrib\hgf\tests\*.prg ) to f.e. _HBMenuItem to avoid conflict with CLASS
MenuItem from rtl\tmenuitm.prg.   
Also we should add to bld_b32.bat this lines  
echo %hdir%\lib\hbsix.lib + >> b32.bc 
echo %hdir%\lib\dbffpt.lib + >> b32.bc

Also I find what method Form:LoadFromFile( "form3.hbf" ) (tests\form3res.prg
) not work as properly because form3.hbf not ending with CR+LF.

Viktor, also please remove from contrib\odbc\makefile reference to
browodbc.prg - it is impossible to create libodbc.a from Mingw32

Message-ID: <4F9D0707-6FA9-4C64-B547-36B8D8DD2039@syenar.hu>

Hi Marek,

To be able to use odbc and rddads the user will
have to deal with this problem anyway, my only intention
here is to help this process, if we can.

Including .dll is not the way to go indeed. Nor is a
good thing to have 'sed' (or any other) dependency, but MS
has such great tools, that there is no out-of-the box way
to solve this "rare" problem.

In odbc, we have a .def file. This already looks
wrong, doesn't it? (since nothing guarantees that the
.def file will match the odbc.dll version someone
intends to use with the final application). So I think
we should remove this first. (Or: Should we add ace32.def
to /contrib/rdd_ads? after all we already have ace.h there.)

Then, our options are scarce, as the tool you've
linked - albeit indeed pretty useful - is even more
complicated to get running than having 'sed' on a system
(IMO). So, if we have no better option, I'll remove all
live .def to .lib logic from .bat files and maybe leave
there some text, links and 'pseudo-code', to help solving
this problem locally.

Do you have a pointer to binaries for this Cygwin tool,
we could refer to?

Brgds,
Viktor

PS: Such a shame this Windows "ecosystem" is :(

linked - albeit indeed pretty useful - is even more
complicated to get running than having 'sed' on a system
(IMO). So, if we have no better option, I'll remove all
live .def to .lib logic from .bat files and maybe leave
there some text, links and 'pseudo-code', to help solving
this problem locally.

Do you have a pointer to binaries for this Cygwin tool,
we could refer to?

Brgds,
Viktor

PS: Such a shame this Windows "ecosystem" is :(

Hi,


I find this implementation better than w32_ole.c and I'm using it from 
2005-03-21, when "improved" version of xHarbour's Ole stopped working 
with ole servers I need to communicate. I know this old version is not 
complete, but it's a good start for clear implementation.

I do not remember the exact reason what was wrong. There was some 
problem with _ONERROR method. If OleSetProperty failed, library makes a 
redundant try to use OleGetProperty() or some default property. And this 
hides the real error result or something.
I do not want to touch my working code and find a solution for w32_ole.c 
because old code is working well and I need to have hardware (which is 
interfaced via ole) to test the new.


Best regards,
Mindaugas

P.S. I do not insist on leaving old ole implementation in svn. I compile 
it into my own library from 2005 year source, but I want to express my 
opinion, that it's not complete, but better implementation.

I agree that adding .def files is not a good way to do too.

I don't think so :). If we add a C source file to Harbour,
we can build this tool dynamicaly using a makefile rule or
even using a direct build command in a bat file. Since a C
compiler is "required" to build Harbour I don't find it
"hard" to build this tool automaticaly :).

Unfortunately no. But AFAIK this tool was an "inspiration"
for a pexports package for MingW/Cygwin (at least in its
initial state).

Maybe it's help..

from http://www.mingw.org/docs.shtml#win32api

How to create a def file for a dll
------------------------------

There are several methods that can be tried in order to create a definition
file (.def) when one is not supplied. 
One option is the tool, pexports which is provided in the MinGW Utilities
package, mingw-utils. See the Downloads page for the Current version. If
your dll has functions that use the Pascal calling convention, you'll need
to use the -o option. 
Another option is the tool, impdef. More instructions on how to create def
files from dlls, a copy of impdef and more information on how to use it are
available at Colin Peters' site. See the Tutorials section. Other compilers
may also supply versions of the impdef program that can be used to create a
.def file which will work with any compiler. If you have another version of
impdef from another compiler, you may wish to try it. Some handle the Pascal
calling convention better than others. Borland has a version of impdef and
other compiler utilities available for download at their Borland Community
web site. Their Borland C++ version 5.5 compiler includes several utilities
to help convert between standard formats, their formats and Microsoft's
formats. 
Another option is to use nm which comes with the MinGW distribution. This
option will not work for all dlls. Problems may occur if the dll is stripped
or compiled as 16 bit. To use this technique, you'll need to filter the
output from nm to create a def file. This can be done by hand in an editor
or automated using tools like Perl (Practical Extraction and Report
Language) or grep (global regular expression print) and sed (stream editor).
Even with the automated methods, you may have to make some changes by hand
if the Pascal calling convention is used by the dll. See Colin Peters' site
for more details on this case. (Versions of sed and grep are available from
various sites including archives that host gnuish MSDOS and archives such as
Virtually Un*x that contain Win32 ports of common Unix tools and from the
self-hosting MinGW port distribution. The ActiveState version of Perl works
well on Win32 platforms.) Here are examples of possible filtering
techniques. 

This example uses grep and sed. If you have a dll named file.dll that you
wish to create a def file for named file.def, try the following: 
 
   echo EXPORTS > file.def
   nm file.dll | grep ' T _' | sed 's/.* T _//' >> file.def
                           

To create a library file named file.a from the dll and def file, type: 
   dlltool --def file.def --dllname file.dll --output-lib file.a
                           

This example uses Perl. Copy the following Perl script to a file called
dll.pl and use it: 
   open (OUTFILE,">dll.def");
   print OUTFILE "EXPORTS\n";
   open (INFILE,"dll.fil");
   while(<INFILE>)
   {
      if ($_ =~ /T _/)
      {
         $line = $_;
         $line =~ s/.* T _//;
         print OUTFILE $line;
      }
   }
   close (INFILE);
   close (OUTFILE);
                           

If you have a dll file named file.dll. At the command line, type: 
   nm file.dll > dll.fil
   perl dll.pl
                           

A def file named dll.def will be created. You can rename this as needed.
You'll also probably want to delete dll.fil when you're finished with this
process. 

If you don't have any of these tools on your system, you can still use nm to
create a def file and edit it by hand through an editor. For example: 
   nm file.dll > dll.fil
   find " T _" dll.fil > dll.def
                        

Replace the line at the top of dll.def that was created by the find program
and shows a file name with a line that says EXPORTS. Set your editor to
search for T _ and erase it and anything on the line before it, leaving only
the routine names in the file. 
If the previous options don't work, you can still try to create a def file
using the output from the objdump program (from the MinGW distribution).
Here's an example. 
 
   objdump -p file.dll > dll.fil
                        
Search for [Ordinal/Name Pointer] Table in dll.fil and use the list of
functions following it to create your def file.

Hi Mindauagas,

We can readd it, but I think it's better to have one
implementation working properly rather than having
two, and none of them working properly :)

Can the current one be extended or fixed to work like
you expect?

Subject: [Harbour] msvc makefile.vc
Message-ID: <4736E4A7.7CA8@synel.co.il>

I tested the make files for Borland.
Harbour itself built without a problem on my NT environment.

If HB_*_INSTALL are not defined, each copy of make_b32.bat
try to defined them, but when the batch file terminate, the
environment variable is still SET. So if you try to run make_b32.bat
from various directories (I used the Harbour root and contrib\libct)
the files are going to be INSTALLed to the wrong directory.

Once you SET a variable in a batch, it is still defined untill
you exit the shell prompt, or until you clear the SET. On WinNT and
later you have the commands SETLOCAL / ENDLOCAL which pop the
environment back to it starting state, but it do not exist in Win9x.

-------------------------------------------------


In contrib\libct, if I execute:
make_b32
make_b32 install
make_b32 clean

<harbour>\lib\libct.lib is not deleted

The Harbour root make_b32.bat CLEAN option also clear files
which were copy during the INSTALL phase. Executing the root
make_b32 CLEAN also delete the files which were INSTALLed by
the contrib\libct\make_b32.bat

I wonder if this is the intended behavior?

Yes. But if I reset it (with SET XX=), then we're messing
up the envvars in case the user had them set explicitly
before calling the batch files.

SETLOCAL/ENDLOCAL is nice, but how to guard it for non-supported
platforms (DOS/Win9x)?

Another option is simply not to write HB_*_INSTALL envvars
at all, so that users have to set it explicitly. And another one
is to use another name internally, so that we're not touching
the original envvars when defaulting.

No. 1) I think the root .bat shouldn't delete files
it didn't create. 2) Maybe it shouldn't delete anything
from the INSTALL dirs, after all it's users territory.
(but I don't mind any solution, as long as the root
batch file and contrib batch files behave the same way)

Marek, what do you think?

If Harbour is compiler with HB_C52_STRICT enabled,
it would fail (first) on memoedit.prg, with quite
strange results (slow compilation and incorrect

       is mapped to this function, which is still okey. We could 
       create a fully CA-Cl*pper compatible, non-extended __MRESTORE() 
       without any trouble, if this is an issue.

I don't think there is any good solution to this problem at all.
Either leaving variables which were set, or clearing them at the
end of a bat file, is not a solution. Leaving them set may corrupt
future bat calls, clearing them may corrupt future bat calls too :).

When one uses some king of "File Manager" (Far or Ndn for example)
the problem is small because those FMs use %COMSPEC% to run a new
copy of shell.

So the only one solution seems to be calling bat files thru yet
another one, which could be similar to this one (Bcc assumed) :

@echo off
%COMSPEC% /c make_b32.bat %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

BTW, since most bat files are really similar/identical now, maybe
it is not a *bad* idea to create two "template" bat files and call
them thru local wrappers similar to the one above ...

Sorry, not acceptable to me. For example try to not set HB_CC_NAME ...

Well, I *always* thought this behavior is/was "by design" ;-)
Original makefiles behaved similary if I remeber correctly.

This behavior is true *only* if the end user *did not set*
his own HB*INSTAL vars, assuming he agreed to default ones.
It is caused by a part of CLEAN rule which looks like :

     -if exist bin\*.exe        $(DEL) bin\*.exe        > nul
     -if exist lib\*.lib        $(DEL) lib\*.lib        > nul

And I think it *is* a proper behavior :). If you don't like
it, please modify makefiles acordingly, because I am not
interested in changing it :).

Yes, it can be done. I didn't do it because it seemed
to make the whole process harder to oversee (less "clean"),
and exceptions a bit more difficult to add.

>> SETLOCAL/ENDLOCAL is nice, but how to guard it for non-supported
>> platforms (DOS/Win9x)?

I was only thinking about HB_*_INSTALL.

Actually, now I don't really see too much point
in allowing the users to oveeride HB_CC_NAME.
(it can have two values only - or it breaks -, and we
have one batch file already for each value)

What do you think?

Also, what about using a different internal variable name?
Seems like a viable solution to me.

set HB_INSTALL_DIR=C:\mydir
call make_b32.bat
-- make_b32.bat
set _HB_INSTALL_DIR=%HB_INSTALL_DIR%
if "_HB_INSTALL_DIR%" == "" set _HB_INSTALL_DIR=C:\default\
... work with _HB_INSTALL_DIR across the rest of the process

The contrib makefiles were kinda chaotic before, so there
was no consistent or designed behaviour.

As I said, I don't mind any solution :) But..

What about changing _contrib_ makefiles to also delete their
own INSTALLed .lib, .ch and .api files? I'd only go that
way, if it's not overly complicated to implement (and
doesn't have any side-effect).

Brgds,
Viktor

       or classes in an "invisible" (or "dirty") way, like 
       adding new parameters or accepting new types of parameters.
       In case we want to keep some extended functionality 
       in the default build, we'll need to create new 
       function names. For class extensions, I'm not yet 
       sure what is the proper way to go.
       In case of ML*() functions, I think they should respect 
       SET EOL instead of accepting EOL settings as parameters.

Ok, that's a resonable request.

I use different HB_CC_NAME than the default ones :).
The trick lies in a fact that I do not call make_*.bat
files directly, but I use wrappers to call them. In
those wrappers I have these linkes (well, similar to
them :)) :

    set HB_CC_NAME=bc
    copy /B make_b32.mak make_bc.mak > nul
    call make_b32.bat %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
    del make_bc.mak > nul

and it works :).

That's a nice idea. Please do the neccesary changes since
I will not have time to work on Harbour thru next few days :(.

Ok, I'll look at the problem, but unfortunately it has

One option is use the same mechanism we used for COPYCMD, you
save the old value of the flag (even if the old value is empty),
and when you exit you set the original value. If the original value
was empty, this has the effect of clearing the variable.

Or,

I saw that settings inside the makefiles are not exported, so
maybe the default values should be set inside the mak file
instead on the above batch file?

Well, it will not work if the level of bat calls exeeds two :).
In third level call you will overwrite saved values :(.

It would be the best solution ... if it could be done ...
Unfortunately this is not doable for envvars similar to
HB_MAKE_PROGRAM ( and yes - I use it :) ) and HB_CC_NAME
( I use it too ). I'll check HB*INSTALL however when I
get some more free time ( if Viktor will not resolve it
till that time :) ).

Ok, first I'll add a "ROOT" (or similar) envvar to
every batch file, this will be needed to support
/contrib/hbf, and will also be good to set defaults
for HB_*_INSTALL in .mak files.

Brgds,
Viktor

I still can't see the big picture though :)
Why do you need this trick?

As for me I'm using two simple batch files (now good for
almost all contrib), named hbbc.bat and hbvc.bat,
which are setting up all PATH, INCLUDE, C_USR (to my
taste) and whatnot envvars and are doing a
"call make_*.bat %*" followed by a "call make_*.bat %*".
(I use essentially the same for core).

Brgds,
Viktor

First of all I like symmetry : vc-bc-gc-ce, which
means MSVC, BCC, GCC, WINCE for me ;-)

Secondly, it's a problem of naming harbour dll for
different compilers. I started to use vc-bc long ago
and now my make files for Harbour project have hard
dependencies around this convention. And truely
speaking I am happy with it :).

BTW, before you introduced dependency between bat files
and HB_CC_NAME envvar, it was enough to set HB_CC_NAME
(CC_DIRNAME before) :).

This is good and recomended way of doing things ;-)
( just kidding :) ). Anyway, that's what I think most
end users do.

Hi Chen, Marek,

Here's my patch, pls review it.

(BTW, the only small downside of moving HB_*_INSTALL
vars to make file level, is that it will not be possible
anymore to copy .lib files created from .dlls to the
proper path. This is not a huge problem though.)

    * contrib/mtpl.mak
    * contrib/mtpl_b32.mak
    * contrib/mtpl_vc.mak
      + Added support for HB_ROOT.
      + Now default HB_*_INSTALL dirs are set inside make files.
        (to avoid manipulating these envvars on the batch file level)

    * contrib/libmisc/make_b32.bat
    * contrib/libmisc/make_vc.bat
      - Removed HB_*_INSTALL manipulation from .bat files.

    * contrib/hgf/win32/make_b32.bat
    * contrib/hgf/win32/make_vc.bat
    - contrib/hgf/win32/make_b32.mak
    - contrib/hgf/win32/make_vc.mak
    + contrib/hgf/win32/common.mak
      + Now using contrib template make files.

    ; TODO: Remove HB_*_INSTALL manipulation from all make*.bat batch  
files.

Hi,


a had a long discussion with Ron that time, but he rejected to fix the 
problem. I've started to use old simple library. I haven't touched this 
code and haven't tested recent implementation (but current 
implementation with goto OleGetID reminds me the problem very much).


Best regards,
Mindaugas

OK.

Of cause it can, but I'm not Ole guru and I don't want (nor can, because 
I need hardware to test) to touch current working code.

Those "patch" files are beyond my "understanding" :)
Przemek always says to me that they are *really* simple,
but I was able to apply them succefully only two or so
times :( unfortunately. Other tries were always
unsuccesfull with "magic" mesages ;-). But looking
at it I guess it's a way  to go.

bEnd is codeblock which should return numeric loop end value, but not 
logical value. For example:
   aI := ARRAY(10)
   HB_FORNEXT(1, {|| LEN(aI)}, {|X| IF(X % 3 == 0, AADD(aI, NIL), NIL), 
QOUT(X)})

I'm heavily using xHarbour Ole (since years) and found no problem so far. 
Anyway, can you show a sample of the problem using commonly used Ole servers 
as Word or Excel?

Petr,

Thanks for the examples, which both return "1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/".  For 
some reason, I did not realize that the code block in the second 
parameter to HB_FORNEXT is designed to return a numeric value, making it 
similar to a do() statement in C, instead of a logical, like a while() 
statement.

No. I try to avoid Ole as much as possible, but hardware I needed to 
connect to my program had Ole interface only. So, I was pushed to use ole.

Thanks Przemek

Because I am not familiar with any distribution other than BCC55 which I
ever has used so far, I could not get through. Can you point me step-by-step
( just like to a student ) what to download exactly, giving links, then how
to place different components, and how to compile Harbour itself, how to
compile wcecon.prg.

I know it will take a while of your precious time, but it will help me and
others too a lot.

This is what I did so far:

1) Downloaded: MinGW-5.1.3 and installed in default (c:\MinGW\) folder.
2) Downloaded: binutils-2.17.50-20060824-1.tar.gz
3) Downloaded: gcc-core-3.4.5-20060117-1.tar.gz
4) Downloaded: mingw-runtime-3.13.tar.gz
5) Downloaded: w32api-3.10.tar.gz
6) Downloaded: cegcc-mingw32ce-0.50-1.i586.rpm

I just followed your message and downloaded what I could thought is right. I
am sure I did not do everything right. 

I do not know what to do with .gz .rmp files.

Absolutely novice :(

Pritpal Bedi

Hi Guillermo,

It seems that your BCC55 is not installed properly,
as per the readme of BCC55, after you install it,
you need to manually create bcc32.cfg in the same
dir as bcc32.exe (C:\borland\BCC55\bin\bcc32.cfg),
with the following two lines:
-I"C:\borland\BCC55\include"
-L"C:\borland\BCC55\lib"

Now, the only other thing you have to do, is adding
C:\borland\BCC55\bin\ to your PATH envvar before
calling make_b32.bat.

There might be other ways to achieve the same
effect, but this is the simplest one. As a rule
of thumb, you never need to modify any Harbour
build files to create a successful build.

Brgds,
Viktor

Thanks Viktor. now work fine, . . . but:

[SPA]
?Porqu? solo se generan s?lo 21 archivos de LIB (*.lib), con MinGW tengo 
41 (*.a)?
?Es esto correcto?

[ENG]
Why only generate only 21 files LIB (*. lib), with MinGW I have 41 (.*)?
Is this correct?

TIA

Best Regards.

Yes, this is because the GNU make system automatically
builds many libraries from /contrib/.

The non-GNU make files (make_b32.bat, make_vc.bat) however, won't
do this; instead, you'll have to build them one by one, by
going to any contrib dir and running the local make_b32.bat
or make_vc.bat.

'make_b32.bat' will build the contrib.
'make_b32.bat install' will copy the results to your lib/include dir.

'make_b32.bat clean' will remove all build result files.

Brgds,
Viktor

you can't mix them.

http://cegcc.sourceforge.net/ says it works only for Linux and Cygwin
not for mingw.

If you want to stay in Windows you need a "Windows native" arm cross compiler.

I don't think this is a problem in Harbour itself, but if someone
can help this user (preferably Spanish speaker) and find out if
this is something wrong on the Harbour implemntation.

Thanks,

Hi Chen,

This is not a Harbour issue, but a Windows/OLE/Tasks one;
running OLE from scheduled tasks can be tricky in a any language.

Scheduled tasks can be run before login, and in this case,
I've found no way to access any OLE object. I just suspect
this must be the case with Jorge, but he didn't mention
what sort of setting he used for that Scheduled task.

Scheduled tasks can be run under a different account too,
and if this is the LOCAL SYSTEM account, I don't think there
is any way to run OLE (but I don't know the exact rules for
that). For non LOCAL SYSTEM account, there still can be
problems with first-time initialization of OO, MSO
(but this results in different error than the mentioned
one).

Though, I think it should be safe to run a scheduled task
with OLE under the same user account as the logged-in one.

Brgds,
Viktor

.gz are compressed files. You can open it in Windows using WinZip or similar

Unfortunately, not all Windows versions provide TrackMouseEvent() API 
function... :-(

You have enough knowledge and it's possible to remove such dependences.
I cannot make it myself due to limited access to Windows and MSVC but
I can help in this process. I've just removed some dependences like
errno or clock(). We can make the same with others. Please remeber
that it's not WinCE issue but rather MSVC. There are WinCE compilers
for which this modifications are not necessary. We should also expect
that all such moduifications will be necessary with new MSVC versions
also for normal Win32 builds in few years so it's good to make them.

No. MS systematically cut their C compilers and it's mostly visible
in WinCE builds but not only and such modifications effects also
standard Win32 builds. As I can see in each new MSVC version so
old functionality (like stdlib) is reduced and it's not related to
WinCE at all. As I said above there are compilers for WinCE which
supports missing in MSVC functionality. Some compilers like CeGCC
can even emulated POSIX environment in WinCE so a lot of our code
covered by OS_UNIX_COMPATIBLE can be used in WinCE with this compiler.

No they haven't if they used MinGW or Linux builds.
In all these builds to use ADS RDD or HBODBC it was not necessary
to make any other modifications then passing -lace or -lodbc to linker
parameters, f.e.:
    hbmk -n -w -es2 -lace test
so this problem exist only in some builds not in all.
If Extended System does not distribute import library with ace32.dll
then we should only leave information how to create such library from
.dll for linkers which cannot make it dynamically during linking process
but we do not have to recreate it in each Harbour build.

Well, if we can save a few users the effort to
find out how to do it (or even doing it automatically),
it's already a gain. And that's what we're doing now.

Przemek, please be specific as to what feature
exactly break and what depencences are missing, and
let's address them one by one, reenabling full
HB_EXTENSION is not the proper solution.

AFAIK, 5 RDD funcions are affected, let's please
solve this properly.

I was wondering how can it happen that a function exists in WinCE
runtime libs, but there is no header for it...

Anyhow, even if CeGCC implements POSIX with it's own runtime code,
or the (or a) "classic" C runtime, it's good (and of course
possible), but Harbour cannot make real use of it, if we want to
keep it compile on other CE compilers (and we do). So we need to
use the least common denominator. And because of this - from our
POV - WinCE _is_ actually different (otherwise it wouldn't be this
complicated to port, would it?).

What I don't understand is what is M$'s point? I thought they
want their platform to catch up..

Brgds,
Viktor

This is a problem because I do not use MS-Windows. I can give you such
instruction for RPM based Linux distributions and in previous message
I did it. It's very simple.

1. from non root account take hbgtmk.sh from SF by:
     curl https://harbour-project.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/harbour-project/trunk/harbour/hbgtmk.sh > /tmp/hbgtmk.sh
   and run it by:
     sh /tmp/hbgtmk.sh
   it will check if you have all necessary tools intalled and then
   will take current code from SF SVN repository and create Harbour
   binaries in RPMs in $HOME/RPM/RPMS/<arch>/ diectory
2. install from root account newly created RPMs
3. Download from http://cegcc.sourceforge.net/
   cegcc-mingw32ce-0.50-1.i586.rpm and install it.
4. run from non root account: make_rpmce.sh
   it will create binary RPM harbour-ce-<ver>.<arch>.rpm with
   WinCE/PocketPC cross build Harbour compiler in $HOME/RPM/RPMS/<arch>/
   directory
5. install from root account newly created RPM

And now you can use hbce* scripts to create WinCE binaries.
In /usr/share/doc/harbour-ce-<ver> you will find README.RPM with
additional information about hbce* scripts.

If you also want to create x86/Win32 binaries in your Linux box then
install MingGW32 cross compiler (you can download ready to install RPMs
from http://mirzam.it.vu.nl/mingw/) and then run: make_rpmw32.sh
It will create harbour-w32-<ver>.<arch>.rpm in $HOME/RPM/RPMS/<arch>/
Install it and you will be able to use hbw* to create Win32 binaries
in you Linux box.


But if you want descition for Windows then it will be a problem for
me and I hope that MS-Windows users will help you.
First you should download MinGW and MSYS binaries for Windows.
On SF you should find self installing binaries. I do not know
what this *.exe packages exactly contain so I cannot say which
additional files you will have to download and install. Hope MS-Win
users will help here.

Now you can try to create normal Harbour binaries by simple running
    ./make_gnu.sh install
from Harbour source using MSYS shell (it's bash).
If everything is OK then you should be able to use hb* scripts.
Read in harbour/doc/howtobld.txt about them. If you want to create
self installing archive then you can run ./make_tgz.sh.

Then you should download from http://cegcc.sourceforge.net/
cegcc-mingw32ce-0.50-cygwin.tar.gz and decompress it root / MSYS
directory (in /opt/mingw32ce you should have MinGW32-CE cross compiler)
It's CYGWIN build so the exe files inside will probably need cygwin*.dll
You can install whole cygwin environment but probably cygwin*.dll will
be enough.
Finally run:
    ./make_xmingwce.sh install
to create WinCE/PocketPC binaries. If you want to create self installing
archive then you can run:
    ./make_xmingwce.sh tgz

I hope that MS-Windows users will give you more precise description.

No. They want their platform to be unique and difficult to port FROM.

I tried as follows:

1) Downloaded MinGW installer and INSTALLED as default at C:\MinGW
2) Downloaded MSYS installer and INSTALLED as default in C:|msys\1.0.
    Just before completion of installation it asked for the mingw
installation path
    which I provided properly. /etc/fstab  conained this mapping.
3) Downloaded cegcc-mingw32ce-0.50-cygwin.tar.gz  and decompressed in
c:\msys\1.0
    the folder appeared as c:\msys\1.0\opt  containing mingw32ce subfolder
with whole tree.
4) Clicked MSYS icon from the program manager which opened up the shell
window.
5) After studying the readme file I understood the mapping pattern.
6) In the shell window, I entered these commands:
    a)  $ cd /c/harbour
    b)  $ ./make_gnu.sh install
7) Shell echoed back:   config/global.cf:33: config/msys_nt-5.1/gcc.cf: No
such file or directory
config/dir.cf:9: config/msys_nt-5.1/dir.cf: No such file or directory
make: *** No rule to make target `config/msys_nt-5.1/dir.cf'.  Stop.

8) I investigated harbour/config/global.cf  but it had no readable reference
of 'config/msys_nt-5.1/gcc.cf'
    Line 33 of global.cf reads : include $(TOP)$(ROOT)config/$(HB_ARCH).cf 
    So I understood that this is environmnt setting problem. But what, is
beyond my grasp at this point.

Harbour is installed on C:\Harbour. May be this need be installed in 'msys'.
May be only environment setting will do.

I appreciate your feedback, thanks.

I you can see it from MSYS shell as /opt directory then it's OK.
You can test it by:
    [ -x /opt/mingw32ce/bin/arm-wince-mingw32ce-gcc ] && echo OK

Looks that 'uname' in recent MSYS versions returns new value 'msys_nt-5.1'
and Harbour cannot recognized it automatically.
I'll update build scripts for it in a while. Strange that MinGW user
haven't reported it so far. Probably most of them set HB_ARCHITECTURE
manually.

Yes. You can set HB_ARCHITECTURE manually by:
    export HB_ARCHITECTURE=w32

But you can also download current SVN. I've just updated it.

I checked for the gcc.exe and it is placed in :

I think path need to be reset. How to?

I guess it's output from:
    ./make_gnu.sh install

It uses normal GCC for W32@x86. You need it too. It's a part of
MinGW and should be in your PATH. Usually in /usr/bin or in /bin.
You can test if it is in your PATH by:
    which gcc
or
    gcc --version

If it's not installed then please try to install it.
By default ./make_gnu.sh install installs harbour binaries in
/usr/local/harbour so add /usr/local/harbour/bin to your PATH
f.e.:
    export PATH="/usr/local/harbour/bin:$PATH"
You can add such line to .bashrc file in your MSYS HOME (startup)
directory.
If everything will be correct then you should be able to create
normal Win32 binaries using hb* scripts. Please test it by:
    cd /c/harbour/tests
    hbmk -n -w -es2 -gtwvt wcecon
    ./wcecon.exe

If it will work then next we will try to create Harbour binaries
for WinCE/PocketPC - please inform me.

This is GCC which creates binaries for WinCE/PocketPC with ARM processors.
You need also GCC for Win32 and x86 processors.
You should find it in MinGW download page. Please install it.
And please check your PATH environment variable.
/opt/mingw32ce/arm-wince-mingw32ce/bin should be after /bin and
/usr/bin. In fact you do not need to set this PATH at all - it
will be done automatically by build scripts so maybe you should
remove /opt/mingw32ce/arm-wince-mingw32ce/bin from PATH.
It's possible that you have Win32/x86 GCC but it's hidden by the
WinCE/PocketPC one because /opt/mingw32ce/arm-wince-mingw32ce/bin
is at the beginning of PATH.

When you install native W32@x86 GCC then it will be fixed.

BTW
    gcc -v

shows more information about GCC build.

Binaries are built.

It appears installation of MSYS was a bit messey as it never recognized
MinGW installation and its /bin  path.

I just copied ar.exe and ranlib.exe from MinGW\bin folder into msys\bin and
everything worked fine.

Now advise me how to create PocketPC binaries.

No so fast. It's Win32@x86 program. You have standard MinGW Harbour
binaries. I was the 1-st step. Now you will have to create Harbour
binaries for WinCE/PocketPC and I hope it will be much easier.
Run:
    mkdir /usr/local/arm-wince-cemgw-harbour/{bin,lib,include}

and then:
    ./make_xmingwce.sh install

it should create such binaries and hbce* scripts in
/usr/local/arm-wince-cemgw-harbour/bin
Add this directory to your PATH and now you can use hbcemk, f.e.:
    cd /c/harbour/tests
    hbmkcd -n -w -es2 -gtwvt wcecon

It will create wcecon.exe but it cannot be executed on x86 machines
because it will have code for ARM processors not x86 ones. Copy this
file to your PocketPC device or PocketPC emulator and try to execute.

Thanks
My question is refered to gtwvt because I want shitch to harbour using
gtwvt using ct tools for creating new windows (more important capability
of gtwvw) 
So I want use harbour,gtwvt and one gui lib 
hwgui seem interesting gui because permit of using in same gtwvw
application also if in different form 
Is a important limitation that I can't mix element of two different gui
Is not possible create a standard function for mix element of different
gt and gui? (Minigui , 
Hwgui , oohg, Fivewin, Xailer,Vhx,gtwvt) 
www.canalfive.com have a library who can extend each GUI (Minigui ,
Hwgui , oohg, Fivewin, Xailer,Vhx) 

the GUI libs are just wrappers to the real objects provided by operating
system or another library ( gtk, Qt, etc ). 
Canal five is producing objects/controls in an abstract way, showing an
interface similar to the standard objects 
found in windows, and then build the wrappers specific to each GUI. In
fact, anything showing a handle and handling standard events are easily
wrapped in any GUI. 
The point is that "forms", is a wrapped system|lib object and not a
native one, and canalfive is writing object at system|lib level and then
wrapping it. 
CanalFive is the solution from the opposite side of the answer.
Native harbour Form can be the solution if gui use this form
Will be possible a way for create component for each harbour gui/GT?

Pritbal,
I need also the same feature as Massimo said. There is no problem with
gtwvt- gtwvw and Hwgui. What we want and I can assure you that there are
many users that want the same is to have better controls and more features
in Gtwvw. Because this controls and this features exist in hwgui this is why
we want mixed guis in the same form. As an example we want gtwvt-gtwvw to
have support for controls placement in statusbar. Also font support in
statusbar, Menus with bitmap support more from controls from commoncontrols
etc. What we really need is to extend gtwvw-gtwvw to support the same
controls with the same functionality as hwgui. Even better we need a GT that
can be multiplatform and with it to partially convert a dos terminal program
to a Gui-Browser based one.

What you need is accomplished by GTWVW. Is not it?

Please remeber that philosophy behind GTWVT is different. It is Clipper
oriented rather than Windows oriented. What you are asking for can be
achieved in GTWVT even without the help og HWGUI.

The another point to remember is GTWVT and HWGUI are entirely different
approaches. A HWGUI dialog can be initiated from within GTWVT but cannot be
achieved vice-versa. Both have their own event loop which are impossible to
be synchronized.

Hope it clears you of doubts.

Massimo,
Why you are using gtwvt and not gtwvw? I'm using gtwvw and ct tools window
functions, and I will change every wopen function from ct tools to
createwindow of gtwvw.

www.canalfive.com have a library who can extend each GUI (Minigui ,

the GUI libs are just wrappers to the real objects provided by operating

Canal five is producing objects/controls in an abstract way, showing an

The point is that "forms", is a wrapped system|lib object and not a

CanalFive is the solution from the opposite side of the answer.
Native harbour Form can be the solution if gui use this form
Will be possible a way for create component for each harbour gui/GT?

It's intentional. This harbour.exe was for WinCE/PocketPC only and
cannot be executed in Win32@x86 so I stopped to install it to avoid
possible mistakes. hbcecmp uses harbour.exe from native platform build
and only with some additional -undef:__PLATFORM__* and -D__PLATFORM__*
switches.
BTW as I can see I will have to modify make_xmingwce.sh to
avoid warning when native MS-Windows harbour binary is used:
    Warning W0001  Redefinition or duplicate definition of
                   #define __PLATFORM__Windows

And probably libpp.a was not created because UNAMEL was also wrong
in MSYS. I'll fix it soon. Please try to rebuild Harbour after my
commit.
First clean by:
    ./make_gnu.sh clean
    ./make_xmingwce.sh clean

and then:
    ./make_gnu.sh install > log-mgw 2> log-mgw.err
    ./make_xmingwce.sh clean > log-cemgw 2> log-cemgw.err

if possible please send here or to me log-mgw.err and log-cemgw.err
This files will contain all error and warning messages. I'd like to
check if the build process works as expected.

Hi,


Is __POCC__ a Pelles C compiler? If yes, maybe it's possible to build 
ARM executable using Pelles C.

Yes.

It's possible to recompile Harbour using Pelles C and -Tarm-coff switch.
I even have such configuration for tests. But in few cases it seems to not
work properly. F.e. I have to use:
    export C_USR="${C_USR} -DYYTYPE_INT16=int"
to avoid wrong warnings that some values are to big for 'short' type
in bison files. The same warnings also appears during hbpcre compilation.
It looks like a bug in POCC so I do not know if final binaries can be
linked and executed on PocketPC - I haven't tested seeing above.
So far MinGW32-CE works perfectly for me as I want.

Przemek,
I don't use EL codepage but there are characters that's missing.
ELDOS
Capital
After chr(237) add chr(244)
After chr(239) add chr(245)
Small
After chr(229) add chr(228)
After chr(231) add chr(232)

ELWIN
Capital
After chr(186) add chr(218)
After chr(190) add chr(219)
Small
After chr(223) add chr(250)
After chr(253) add chr(251)
After chr(250) add chr(192)*
After chr(251) add chr(224)*

*This characters does not have correspondence in capital ELWIN and does not
exist in ELDOS. If we want to add this characters in Capital ELWIN we can
use chr(218) for chr(192), and chr(219) for chr(224).

Also I'm not sure how this will work in the future but is it possible to
have dynamic sorting, equality using something like Setcodepage( "ELWIN",
CI, AI )?    CI = case insensitive, CS = Case sensitive, AI = Accent
insensitive, AS = accent sensitive.

<<<
It's intentional. This harbour.exe was for WinCE/PocketPC only and
cannot be executed in Win32@x86 so I stopped to install it to avoid
possible mistakes. hbcecmp uses harbour.exe from native platform build
and only with some additional -undef:__PLATFORM__* and -D__PLATFORM__*
switches.
>>>

I sensed that.

<<<
BTW as I can see I will have to modify make_xmingwce.sh to
avoid warning when native MS-Windows harbour binary is used:
    Warning W0001  Redefinition or duplicate definition of
                   #define __PLATFORM__Windows

And probably libpp.a was not created because UNAMEL was also wrong
in MSYS. I'll fix it soon. Please try to rebuild Harbour after my
commit.
First clean by:
    ./make_gnu.sh clean
    ./make_xmingwce.sh clean

and then:
    ./make_gnu.sh install > log-mgw 2> log-mgw.err
    ./make_xmingwce.sh clean > log-cemgw 2> log-cemgw.err

if possible please send here or to me log-mgw.err and log-cemgw.err
This files will contain all error and warning messages. I'd like to
check if the build process works as expected.

Attached are the log files.

You can use wvw_nopenwindow instead of wopen.

Massimo,
Why you are using gtwvt and not gtwvw? I'm using gtwvw and ct tools
window
functions, and I will change every wopen function from ct tools to
createwindow of gtwvw.

Subject: RE: [Harbour] integration gt and gui

Thanks
My question is refered to gtwvt because I want shitch to harbour using
gtwvt using ct tools for creating new windows (more important capability
of gtwvw) 
So I want use harbour,gtwvt and one gui lib 
hwgui seem interesting gui because permit of using in same gtwvw
application also if in different form 
Is a important limitation that I can't mix element of two different gui
Is not possible create a standard function for mix element of different
gt and gui? (Minigui , 
Hwgui , oohg, Fivewin, Xailer,Vhx,gtwvt) 
www.canalfive.com have a library who can extend each GUI (Minigui ,
Hwgui , oohg, Fivewin, Xailer,Vhx) 

the GUI libs are just wrappers to the real objects provided by operating
system or another library ( gtk, Qt, etc ). 
Canal five is producing objects/controls in an abstract way, showing an
interface similar to the standard objects 
found in windows, and then build the wrappers specific to each GUI. In
fact, anything showing a handle and handling standard events are easily
wrapped in any GUI. 
The point is that "forms", is a wrapped system|lib object and not a
native one, and canalfive is writing object at system|lib level and then
wrapping it. 
CanalFive is the solution from the opposite side of the answer.
Native harbour Form can be the solution if gui use this form
Will be possible a way for create component for each harbour gui/GT?

different gui or gt
>>>

Why you want GTWVT integration with HWGUI ?

What you need is accomplished by GTWVW. Is not it?

Please remeber that philosophy behind GTWVT is different. It is Clipper
oriented rather than Windows oriented. What you are asking for can be
achieved in GTWVT even without the help og HWGUI.

The another point to remember is GTWVT and HWGUI are entirely different
approaches. A HWGUI dialog can be initiated from within GTWVT but cannot
be
achieved vice-versa. Both have their own event loop which are impossible
to
be synchronized.

Hope it clears you of doubts.

According to this rule the following expression
is a valid Harbour expression :

    123 := a

I verified it in GOLD, and yes, it accepts such
an expression as a valid one. But Harbour itself
generates a proper error - "Invalid lvalue".

Could you shortly explain me why this rule is
defined in such a way, and how it is done that
Harbour properly generates error in this case ?

Sorry to you and all others - too much messages in short time and I was
not able to answer to all. Thank you for this modification. RDDINFO()
is very important function which allow to control many of RDD behaviors.
BTW I suggest you to make also MinGW builds before commit. It creates
harbour.dll and it will catch all insufficient dependences in core code.

I'd like to leave such modifications for Greek users. I can update
EL* CPs but I can miss some important things.
I also suggest to create CPs compatible with Clipper for users who
may want to share indexes with Clipper. In my Clipper version I can
find GR437 and GR851 - both contains 26 Latin and 35 Greek letters.
Below I'm attaching small code which generates letter sets which can
be used by our CPs. It's enough to compile it by Clipper and link
with valid ntx<sort>.obj.

No but you can create two CPs with different collation orders. Please
also remember that such switches are very dangerous. You will corrupt
indexes quite fast changing it.

Not now. For such modification it will be necessary to create common
message loop. So it will have to be real integration. IMHO it will be
much easier to add to WHGUI support for standard console commands
by creating GTHWG.

Are you sure it's not side effect of C compiler switches?
W32OLE code is not alignment free - it's sth what should be
fixed.
I would like to ask Windows users to verify this also using
other C compilers.

And this is an answer.

I haven't created this and some other similar rules
but the only one reason we have them is generating
Clipper compatible error messages. It means the we can
eliminate some rules from grammar files but it will
cause that we will generate only one error message
in all modified places: 'syntax error'
Anyhow IMO many of our rules can be greatly simplified
but I'm leaving it to the moment when we will try to
eliminate online PCODE generation (somewhere in the
future after 1.0 when we will have more spare time ;-))
to not make similar things twice.

Thank you.
I guess that log-mgw.err was empty so you haven't attached it.
As I can see you copied manually pptable.c to source/pp as
workaround for porblem with locating platform native hbppgen.exe.
If possible and you have a while then please remove source/pp/pptable.c
and then once again repeat tests with clean builds of both compilers
using current SVN code. I'd like to check if all modifications I've
done in last days for MinGW builds are correct. Then please send
log-mgw.err and log-cemgw.err. Sorry but I cannot test it myself
in real MS-Windows and MSys environment now.

I removed NumValue, NilValue, ... from this rule and

Exactly as you described :).

I'm not BCC user but someone (AFAIR Chen) said that OLE code has to
be compiled with -a8 by BCC. Because in w32_ole.c we also have code
which access HVM internals (it's one of the things which should be
fixed) then it means that HVM will have to be compiled with the same
alignment. If you can make a test and recompile whole code with -a8
and then your example it can help us to locate the problem.

I see it's a side effect of make_b32 and make_vc which creates
pptable.c in source/pp directory.

Viktor can you change $(PP_DIR)\pptable.c to $(OBJ_DIR)\pptable.c
in make_b32.mak and make_vc.mak just like it is in make_gcc.mak?
Probably copping dependences list used for $(OBJ_DIR)/pptable.c by
make_gcc.mak is also good idea. I cannot test such modifications
so I do not want to make them myself.

Thank you very much - now MinGW and MinGW-CE builds in MSys environment
are created cleanly without any errors or warnings.

BTW This builds are created without any C compiler optimizations.
I suggest to make:
    export C_USR=-O3

before MinGW32 build and
    export C_USR=-O2

before MinGW32-CE build to enable optimizations in C compiler - the final
binaries will be much faster.

The weekend has just began and I've found some
free time to play with WinCE/MSVC port :).

Everything compiles OK out of the box, without
any additional files. Przemek, many thanks for
your outstanding work.

As usual in my case, dll part of WinCE makefile
is not finished yet :). It's a matter of fixing
CFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables, but I am leaving
it for the future enhancements (or for someone
interested).

I'd like to add WinCE/MSVC bat/makefile to SVN
but I need to figure out how to do this :(.

Yes! It works fine with -a8. But why I can use -a4 with xHarbour's Ole 
implementation?

Yes, you have to remove oRs:End(). Anyway, as I said in the previous 
message, it works fine using -a8 (that is not the default setting at least 
for BCC 5.5.1, it is -a4).

Are you sure about it?
In xHarbour -a8 is set inside makefile.bc so for different alignment
you will have to edit this file manually. Did you make it?
What does this code show when you compile it by xHarbour?

    #include "hbmemory.ch"
    proc main()
    ? "sizeof(HB_ITEM):", memory(HB_MEM_STACK) / memory(HB_MEM_STACKITEMS)
    return

BTW does anyone plan to work on W32OLE code?
If yes then he should should try to eliminate form contrib/win32/w32_ole.c
code which needs hbvmopt.h. It will make w32_ole.c alignment independent
from HVM so we can add #pragma pack... in this file for compilers
which may need it, f.e. BCC32. I do not want to make such modifications
myself because I cannot test this code in Linux.

best regards,
Przemek

Hi Przemek, All,

> BTW does anyone plan to work on W32OLE code?

I guess I could be a quite good candidate to take
care of Harbour OLE code, since I wrote a completly
new implementation of it privately.

As you have probably noticed, I am trying to avoid
any discussion about OLE at all.

The reason is quite simple. Partially, my private
implementation uses a code which I wrote for my
employer for other, not related to Harbour at all,
project.

Although I have an explicit permission to use this
code for my own needs, I have no rights to make this
code publicly available as a source code - neither
as OpenSource nor commercially.

That's the reason I am trying to avoid working on
Harbour OLE implementation - quite similary to you
when try to avoid working on code like rmdbfcdx.

Message-ID: <13806677.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello Everybody

Is there a possibility to include these files to xhb.lib ?

xharbour/source/rtl/hbcomprs.c
xharbour/source/rtl/hbchksum.c
xharbour/include/hbcomprs.h

I have made changes to access direct item members to api calls.

Here are the working files for Harbour:
http://www.nabble.com/file/p13806677/hbcomprs.c hbcomprs.c 
http://www.nabble.com/file/p13806677/hbchksum.c hbchksum.c 
hbcomprs.c can be brought direct from xharbour/include.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

PS . I need SVN write permissions, if group agrees. My SourceForge ID =
vouchcac .

Hi,
:typeOut is a read-only object var, and your custom TGETLIST()
is trying to write into it. This is fixed in the Harbour TGETLIST()
class, pls try it, or update your code to reset :typeOut() using a
:Home() call.

Brgds,
Viktor

Many thanks. I am not used to those all important details :(.

BTW, I had to traverse all contrib dirs to make changes to
bat files and I have to say I really don't like such a tedious
work. So I decided to remove redundancy from contrib bat files
to make similar, future work - easier.

Here is a link to an example of what I am going to do with
contrib bat files : http://republika.pl/hbfltk/contrib.zip.

This example contains only two contrib dirs : "easy" dir
(adordd) and "complex" dir (odbc). Other dirs are simply
similar to those above.

Note that redundancy in bat files will be removed :).

Subject: [Harbour] echo. command in makefiles
Message-ID: <473F0042.9070404@interia.pl>

Hi,

Current makefiles for Windows system have such a definition

!ifndef ECHO
ECHO = echo.
!endif

in their body. The makefiles themselvs have the following
notice :

# NOTE: "echo." intentionally used instead of "echo", to
#       avoid conflicts with external commands named echo.

But unfortunately echo. does not work under Bcc on my system.
Does it work on yours ?

To me this definition does not make much sense and I would
like to change it normal echo (without a dot). Any opinions ?

Hi Guillermo,
You're trying to write to an object var which is read-only.

So, in your custom TGetList() implementation (which is most
likely an old version from either Harbour or xhb), instead of this
kind of code:

oGetList:typeOut := .F. // WRONG

write this:

oGetList:Home() // RIGHT

Or, use the TGetList() class that comes with the latest Harbour.


Brgds,
Viktor

Viktor,

>
Guillermo is trying to sy that he is asimple user that has any custom 
TGetList implementation.
Even when Guillermo hasnt said nothing about his environment, I suspect 
he is using FiveWin for Harbour, because I have the same problem here 
because of the usage of tget inside FW Controls. If that is the case, 
there is an active thread in FW forum where this point is being handled.

Regards,

Carlos.

Viktor, siento tener que molestarte otra vez, al parecer no me estoy 
explicando correctamnte.
Lo que yo estoy reportando es algo muy sencillo, solo prueba el codigo 
que te estoy enviando y verifica que cuando borras un dato, el dia, el 
mes o el a?o, resulta que tambien de borra el separador "/". y luego al 
dar <Enter> da el error que estoy reportando.

Gracias Carlos Mora, por aclararle el tema a Viktor.
Aclaro que estoy usando modo consola, yo no uso ninguna GUI ni terceras 
partes.
Estoy utilizando el WinXP SP2 + MinGW + el ultimo SVN de Harbour
/*
 * $Id: ChangeLog 7991 2007-11-17 11:42:49Z vszakats $
 */

[SPA]
Viktor, Sorry, I have to bother again, it seems I am not explaining 
correctamnte.
What I am reporting is something very simple, just test the code that I 
am sending you and verifies that when delete data, the day, month or 
year, which is also deletes from the separator "/". And then to give 
<Enter> gives us what I am reporting.

Thanks Carlos Mora, by clarifying the matter to Viktor.
Let me that I am using console mode, I do not use any GUI or third parties.

I've told the exact way to fix this, so whoever (3rd party?) is
responsible for this piece of wrong code, will have to do the fix.
The fix doesn't have any bad side-effects, it should work even
with older TGET() implementations, moreover, this is how
CA-Cl*pper achieves the same thing. It is simply wrong old
Harbour code, copied to a 3rd party product.

Brgds,
Viktor

Uy!!! no me volvi a explicar bien.

Como habr?n podido notar, mi ingl?s en muy malo, alguien puede verificar 
este error y reportarlo adecuadamente.
el c?digo en modo consola es ?ste:

PROCEDURE Main
  LOCAL dDate := DATE()
  CLS
  @ 1,1 SAY "Borre la fecha y luego presione <ENTER>: " GET dDate
  READ
  RETURN

lo que pasa es que al borrar el dia, el mes o el a?o, tambien se borran 
los separadores ("/") , en clipper no pasa esto.

Gracias de Antemano.

Best Regards.

What Guillermo is saying is that when you issue a GET on a date
variable,  if you happen to erase the day, month or year, separators get
erased as well. In Cl*pper this is not the case.

I may have done that.  What system are you using?  In 8 years, I can only 
recall one other report somehow related to this.  This should have nothing 
to do with which compiler you are using, since it should just be passed to 
your command processor.

The comment states why it is there.  How can it be stated to make more 
sense?

Echo.

works in command.com and cmd.exe

Echo

gives something different...

Well, I on the other hand, was about to propose to remove this
ECHO hack :) because "echo." should always work in DOS/Windows
shells, even when someone has an echo.exe right there in the path.

So, as far I can see, we should rather change every "echo ..." to "echo.
..."
so that we can avoid this hack.

Or, to put it another way, why do we need the "ECHO hack"?

Brgds,
Viktor

Win2003 + NDN (Necromander's Dos Navigator).

Echo is used in CLEAN rule and it does not work.
Here is an error I get :

-----------
MAKE Version 5.2  Copyright (c) 1987, 2000 Borland
     echo. echo off > delone.bat
Fatal: Unable to execute command: echo.
-----------

Note that if I change "echo." to "echo" it works OK.

Sorry, I meant that "system command" is named "echo" not "echo.".
And in this context this move does not seem "sensible" to me.
"echo." means that an interpreter should look for an executable
named "echo" (without extension), not that it should use its
internal command named "echo". AFAIK.

Yes, "echo" is an internal shell command, while "echo." not.

I made more tests and it seems echo. works ok when it is
executed from bat files, but not when it is executed from
a borland make.exe. In the latter case make.exe tries to
execute an executable named "echo.". I don't know why.

Hi Viktor,

Well, truly speaking I have no idea :). However I would leave
$(DEL) trick in place, because sometimes I use it to "implement"
a "safe delete" operation :).

I'm not sure if it is a standard compression algorithm. If yes, then I 
suggest to use zlib.dll and PRG wrapper function posted by Przemyslaw 
2007-05-17. If you need a static zlib library, you can compile static 
library from official zlib source (it's easy, you'll need to fix some 
warnings only) or even find precompiled one, for example in 
http://libharu.sourceforge.net/

I can commit zlib and minizip (.zip support with non restrictive 
license) to Harbour after I move my applications from xHarbour to 
Harbour. Lack of i18n stops me from doing it.

Hi,


it is expected that Harbour's string items should contain termination 
character, and many C code relies on this. hb_itemPutCLConst() allows to 
create string item, which breaks this rule. If we need function like 
this, I suggest to test, if string is valid by adding these lines to the 
source:

     if( szText[ ulLen ] != '\0' )
     {
          hb_errInternal( 666, "Internal error: hb_itemPutCLConst() 
missing termination character", NULL, NULL );
      }


Best regards,
Mindaugas

No problem, our batch/make files are almost fully
consisted of macros already ;)

BTW, I've just tested "echo." in mtpl_b32.mak, and
it _did_ work here (under Far Manager), so it might have
something to do with your shell catching but not properly
interpreting this command.

Viktor

Hi Mindaugas,

Many thanks for noting this.

I'll add it, but we will have to check whether
this breaks w32_old.c (the only user of this
new Item API call.)

Viktor

Sorry, I am not so lucky guy ;-) - it doesn't work under
Far Manager here. Even more - it doesn't work under pure
Dos console. And really I have no idea why. Make.exe
version ?

While I won't argue your idea of what it should mean, that's not how

That's not what I meant!  I will agree that Echo. is a bit of an anomoly, 
but execute both those commands with a compatible  CP, and you'll get a 
blank line in the first case, and 'echo is on' in the second.

I think the other reason this came about was that I saw 'Echo >make.tmp' way 
back when and that didn't produce the desired result I'm sure.

The other thing referred to in the comment had something to do with 
executing an external echo.exe.  I no longer remember the details, but I had 
\cygwin\bin\echo.exe and under some condition that was interferring when it 
should not have.  (Perhaps a shell of some sort)

Hi Marek,

Maybe there is some difference in how we're testing.

What I did is s&r "$(ECHO)" with "echo." in mtpl_b32.mak
and did a "make_b32.bat" then a "make_b32.bat clean"
(both started through my hbbc.bat batch file) in
one of the contribs, and the .c/.obj files went.

WinXPSP2EN
Far Manager 1.70 (Build 2087)
COMSPEC=C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe

Brgds,
Viktor

make_b32 clean doesn't delete make_b32.log anymore (it did before).

Do you mean harbour/make_b32.bat ? Can you post make_b32.log content
after issuing make_b32 clean ?

Yes, I know. I wrote a post stating that running echo. from a bat
file works OK here. Running it from makefile - does not work. That's
the problem.

Yes, I seem to recall similar problems with cygwin many years ago
but now I do not have any problems with it. Maybe MS or cygwin has
changed something, but now it seems to work without problems. Even
if echo.exe is in a path and can be seen by CP.

Your environment description inspired me to setup
a VirtualPC machine with WinXP and to test this
echo. issue under WinXP ... and viola ! It works.

So I guess the problem has something to do with
Borland make.exe and Win2003. I wonder anyone
else uses Win2003 too - I'd like to hear other's
experience.

Then it means CLEAN rule failed at the begining.
I guess you should get an error why it failed on
a dos command prompt. Please run it in pure DOS
window (without any file manager which could hide
an error).

Yes, you are right:

"make.exe" non e riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,
 un programma eseguibile o un file batch.

To chyba wloski (?)

 2 polish translation:

 nazwa "make.exe" nie jest rozpoznawana jako polecenie wewnetrzne lub zewnetrzne,
 program wykonywalny lub plik wsadowy

english:

'make.exe' is not recognized as an internal or external command,

Sorry. It is something like:

"make.exe" is not recognized as internal or external command, executable 
program or batch file.

Hi

<<<
I'm not sure if it is a standard compression algorithm. If yes, then I 
suggest to use zlib.dll and PRG wrapper function posted by Przemyslaw 
2007-05-17. If you need a static zlib library, you can compile static 
library from official zlib source (it's easy, you'll need to fix some 
warnings only) or even find precompiled one, for example in 
http://libharu.sourceforge.net/

I can commit zlib and minizip (.zip support with non restrictive 
license) to Harbour after I move my applications from xHarbour to 
Harbour. Lack of i18n stops me from doing it.
>>>

I needed to uncompress a string sent back from an xHarbour SERVER to an
Harbour CLIENT. Because I am usning xHarbour's HB_Compress() function, I
need exactly the same uncompressed string in Harbour, so I suggested this
inculsion. I will be waiting for your contribution. By then I need this
functionality.

BTW there is no harm in including these files in Harbour.

>> xharbour/source/rtl/hbchksum.c
>See, harbour/source/rtl/hbadler.c

Both files differs a bit in parameter castings and internal structuring. For
the time being I am adding hbchksum.c to avoid any difference(s) which may
occur. Later this can be removed.

Message-ID: <13823766.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello Everybody

Exact xHarbour functionality of GTWVT and WVTGUI port is ready for Harbour
with very few differences which I think can be resolved quickly. These
differences do not affect program flow in any way.

In xHarbour WVTGUI is a contrib lib. In Harbour I propose to include it as a
unified library as GTWVG (WIndows Graphical Terminal Driver). This way
present GTWVT in Harbour keeps its current status as is.

If the group agrees, then there are two options:

1) GTWVG be placed under source/rtl/gtwvg/
2) GTWVG be placed under contrib/gtwvg/

Please participate in this thread.

Pritpal Bedi, INDIA-USA

Hi Pritpal,

Please add it to contrib so that we can discover
this feature, and later on we can move it to core,
if we know more about it.

Could you pls post your changes to the list before
committing them to the repository?

Hi Marek,

There is a section in mtpl_*.mak which I've added,
and it's meant to copy header files to HB_INC_INSTALL.

The problem is, they are now copying all headers.
Would you mind taking a look at it if we could copy
only those files we explicitly specify in common.mak,
say using PRG_HEADERS and C_HEADERS vars?

Hi

>>I suggest GTVIAGRA :-)

The internal representation of GT in Harbour depends on 3 letter
identification ( correct me if I am wrong ) which can be seen from structure
of source/rtl/gt* folders. Accordingly HB_GT_NAME should be of 3 characters.
That's why I came up with GT(WVG). More appropriate name could be GT(WGE) (
Windows Graphics Emulator ) or GT(WGC) ( Windows Graphic Console ).

I need more opinions on this topic. Try to keep 3 letters after GT.

I suggest also to change GTWIN into sth like GTWCT Windows Console
Terminal before 1.0.

WIN is too generic.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but to me it seems
that more than 3 letters long GT names are actually
technically possible in Harbour, see GTALLEG for a live
example.

But how important is lib name compatibility with xhb?

If it's not that important, I'd have quite some ideas
how to cleanup the contrib names, as currently they are
not following any common standard, and sometimes they
even depend on the platform (for the same contrib, see
ziparchiver vs. hbzlib).

Brgds,
Viktor

I suggest also to change GTWIN into sth like GTWCT Windows Console
Terminal before 1.0.

WIN is too generic.

Not now. For such modification it will be necessary to create common
message loop. So it will have to be real integration. IMHO it will be
much easier to add to WHGUI support for standard console commands
by creating GTHWG.

In your opinion will be possible integrate hwgui or minigui element in
the upcoming GTWVG?
Is gtwvg compatible with ct tools window functions
Particularly with wopen function from ct tools to createwindow like in
gtwvw.

Hello Everybody

Exact xHarbour functionality of GTWVT and WVTGUI port is ready for
Harbour
with very few differences which I think can be resolved quickly. These
differences do not affect program flow in any way.

In xHarbour WVTGUI is a contrib lib. In Harbour I propose to include it
as a
unified library as GTWVG (WIndows Graphical Terminal Driver). This way
present GTWVT in Harbour keeps its current status as is.

If the group agrees, then there are two options:

1) GTWVG be placed under source/rtl/gtwvg/
2) GTWVG be placed under contrib/gtwvg/

Please participate in this thread.

Pritpal Bedi, INDIA-USA

Subject: [Harbour] ADS .h question
Message-ID: <DA8EF13F-5D2C-4708-83CC-5B3F0D188ABD@syenar.hu>

Hi folks,

There is a function declaration in original ads.h files,
looking like this:

UNSIGNED32 ENTRYPOINT AdsApplicationExit();

Note the missing "void" from between the brackets. This is so
at least from version 6.11, till the latest 8.10. This is
the only parameterless declaration which misses the "void".

This causes warnings in rdd_ads code, when compiled with BCC32:
Warning W8085 ..: Call to function 'AdsApplicationExit' with no  
prototype in function ...

- Question 1: Could there be any reasons why this declaration  
consistently
               misses "void", or is this rather an Advantage mistake?
- Question 2: Is there any way to fix this warning on our side?
               (besides using -w-pro option to suppress the warning)

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi,

hbzlib name is completely wrong, because it does not exports any zlib 
functionality. IMHO, ziparchiver (or similar) is much better name.

This is result for -a8 alignment so you xHarbour build does not use 4 bytes
alignment.

Ok, thank you. Do you think there is any problems if I continue to use -a4 
when compiling my PRGs or you recommend to use -a8 everywhere?

I you can commit minizip wrapper then it will be very good news.
Please do it. We should change the name of current hbzlib library
because it's not ZLIB wrapper to ZIPARCH or sth like that and add
HBZLIB as real ZLIB wrapper. If you can also add MINIZIP then we
will have support for .zip files which can be used without additional
restrictions in commercial programs.

It is :-(
hbcomprs.c in xHarbour contains very old ZLIB code. If you add this code to
XHB lib then you will block using current ZLIB code due to name conflicts -
xHarbour has such problem and it was reported many times in the past. If you
really need it then you should make all functions inside this file static.
But I suggest to use current ZLIB library instead. There was a lot of
critical fixes in ZLIB since the old version used in hbcomprs.c was
released. The current version should decode date compressed by older
versions without any problems.

HB_ADLER32() returns exactly the same results as HB_CHECKSUM() in xHarbour
and accepts the same parameters. In hbcompat.ch we have:

   #xtranslate hb_checksum([<x,...>])  => hb_adler32(<x>)

and it's all what you need. Additionally xHarbour hbchksum.c has the same
problem as hbcomprs.c: public function adler32() what creates name conflict
with ZLIB. Here you really do not need this code at all.

In summary you need only ZLIB wrapper with some #xtranslate rules.

Very good news and thank you very much.

I suggest to chose as first place contrib directory then RTL.
I will allow us to look at the code 1-st and maybe it will be
possible to define elements which can be replicated also in
GTXWC. GTXWC makes exactly the same jobs as GTWVT but for *nixes
and XWindow. Having common user interface in GTWVG and GTXVG
will greatly help in portability. So before you will commit it
to core code I'd like to see if it will be possible to create
something similar also for *nixes. Maybe yes but the final version
will need additional modifications. Now we are using SVN so we can
very easy remove directories from repository so we do not have to
worry about old dummy dirs like in CVS.

Hello Przemek

>Very good news and thank you very much.

Thanks to boosting my morale.

Attached is the complete archieve of GTWVG. If taken with GUI elements it is
exactly identical with GTWVT. I have tested the code with BCC55 and MINGW
without any problems. But with MINGW-CE it is reporting unresolved
externals, I do not know why so because those functions are defined as is in
MSDN for Windows and WindowsCE. Please look into.

Also at some places, unicode support has to be fixed. I did changed it a lot
but because do not have in-depth knowledge on this subject, canot do it at
my own.

BTW, current GTWVT in Harbour can be replaced with this one if you deem fit
as this implementation is more complete.

Sorry for my ignorance but what's the difference between GTWVT and GTWVG?

If used as pure console "NOTHING".
If used with GUI extensions, very appealing Windows screens without
sacrificing the Clipper syntax.

To have a bird's eyeview what we can achieve with GTWVG, visit:
http://www.vouchcac.com/ScreenShots/ScreenShots.htm
Though these screens are fairly old, the latest ones have toolbars etc too,
but even then you can have a fairly good overview. To just emphasize, this
lib does not change the way you write code, instead, provide mechanism to
enhance your code to give a GUI look.

This is one of my appln converted to GTWVG (Harbour)   GTWVT+WVTGUI
(xHarbour).

Additionally GTWVG has a nice set of Wvt*Classes() which employ the common
event loop. You can create high performance dialogs with multiple Tbrowe,
Reads, Bitmaps, Buttons, i.e. all GUI elements you can think of. 

More, you can open multiple pure Windows dialogs MODELESS or MODEL from
within your Clipper syntax.

I suggest you to experiment with xharbour/contrib/wvtgui/tests/wvtgui.prg to
learn more about these features. In future I will write a comprehensive
documentation.

If group agrees and someone more gifted developer join hands, these graphic
elements can be embedded with base GT to avoid additional code to be written
by the developer.

Based on GTWVG I am working on another libarry GTWVM ( Multiple Console
Terminal Driver ) just like in XBase++. There you can open multiple consoles
in an application containing its own GT and GUI elements and having its own
processing loop independant of others. It requires deep changes into GT core
code, which at the minimum needs a unique identifier for each GT command. I
have achieved a little bit but seems it is a long way to go, and perhaps, at
my own I cannot do everything. If group decided I can show a prototype of
what I am trying to achieve.

Hope you must be clear about the differences of GTWVT and GTWVG.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi, INDIA-USA

    with the exception to bug with negative values fixed in Harbour only.

ADS is a free download for both Linux and Windows
(the .h file is the same for both), so it shouldn't
be a big issue IMO.

I cannot post direct links, because they're long
wierd ones, but see these for the ADS Clients:

Current: http://www.advantagedatabase.com/clients
Previous: http://devzone.advantagedatabase.com/ -> Product Download Area

Or Google "Advantage Database Download"

One will need the "Advantage Client Engine" API,
as the batch files also say in /contrib/rdd_ads/.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi,

can it have native GUI look (menu, input fields, etc)?  Fixed width font

Hi all,

I'd vote to commit this to contrib and give it
a different name than GTWVT (as we already have one).
GTVWG is fine. I feel that the rules guarding the
core would require too many modifications on this the
lib (talking about namespaces, C, Harbour, class, headers).
Plus, I think we definitely need the current "stripped-down"
version of GTWVT in Harbour, so I wouldn't touch that
in any case.

IMO being in a contrib is an advantage in this case,
my vote to upload it there (contrib/gtwvg). It compiled
fine with BCC32 (find make files attached), with some
warnings. See below:

The main problem with ADS is method of library distribution.
They do not have RPM or DEB packages what eliminates installation
in many systems where admins introduce restrictions for installed
libraries. It means that to create Harbour binaries with ADS* RDDs
people will have to add manually ace.h to Harbour code. We also
will have to update GNU make and RPM spec files and remove default
support for ADS to not break whole compilation process. I'll do
that for Linux but MS-Windows users will have to add some ACE
autodetection for MinGW builds.

Now more important for me is renaming contrib/hbzlib to some different
name. HBZLIB should be reserved for Harbour ZLIB wrapper and we should
add such wrapper soon or we will have to share some of xHarbour problems.
Can you change the name of this library to sth different?
ZIPARCH?, HBZIPARCH?, HBZIPACK?

Przemek

I agree, we'd need to help this process, this
is a global problem for at least 8 other contribs, too.
(apollo, firebird, freeimage, gd, mysql, pdflib, pgsql, msql?)

I have a pending update where I modified it to "ziparch" (for both
GNU and non-GNU make systems). Problem is, I have some other
half-done modifications, so I you need this urgently, please
feel free to do it.

Maybe HBZIPARCH is even better...

Hi Miguel,

Do you see any chance that your RDD can be modified
to use inheritation from the built-in CDX, so that we
can add it to core?

I think it would be an essential addition.

Viktor

Yes I think is better to add it to the core, But someone
prefer it as contrib.

I Think that bmdbfcdx can substitutes actual dbfcdx with the exception of bm
extensions.
all other inproviments are more near from clipper53 than dbfcdx.

In other case I prefer to include it harbour core. Is posible to change for
bmdbfcdx its signature
to a new especific harbour signature that supports all new inprovements. In
this case we can detect
If a DBF files support certanly extensions, for example all new types of
VFP,ADT,Clipper.

Is not my decision, I hope the group demand it.

I what to implement too, real TEMPORAL files under WIN platforms. and add
fully support
to __NullFlags system field only under VFP DBF signature, changing varlength
fields and null
fields.

I think, that by the moment is better to use a new RDD function TO read if
any field is Null.
And in the future implement NULL as item flag, to port this flag between
items.

Best regards,
Miguel Angel Marchuet

I was not thinking about replacing DBFCDX, but rather to add the
index (bitmap) optimized filter feature (these maybe the "BM extensions"
you mention, but I'm not sure now) as an RDD layer, which could be used
with all existing index types (CDX, NTX and even 3rd parties).

Do you think this is possible?

(aside from this, BMDBFCDX could stay as a separate contrib, there
is nothing wrong with that)

I agree.

I'd rather vote to have special functions for this task, like in XBase+

Yes it's not a problem. For me Bitmap filter is not an extension, because
Clipper 5.3 was using it too in similar way.

The extensions are the next:
   BM_DbSeekWild( uKey, [lSoftSeek], [lFindLast], [lNext], [lAll] ) => .T./.F. or aSeekRec when lAll clause
   BM_Turbo( lOnOff, lAllWorkArea ) // It can be implemented only for local workarea
   BM_DbGetFilterArray() => aFilterRec
   BM_DbSetFilterArray( aFilterRec )
   BM_DbSetFilterArrayAdd( aFilterRec )
   BM_DbSetFilterArrayDel( aFilterRec )

that are similar than (SIx and MachSIx Lib):

   Sx_WildSeek( <cSearchStr>, <lCont> )
   m6_FiltAddRec( <nHandle>, <nRecord> )
   m6_FiltDropRec( <nHandle>, <nRecord> )
   m6_FiltSave( <nHandle>, <cFileName> )
   m6_FiltRestore( <cFileName> )
   m6_FiltJoin( <nHandle1>, <nHandle2), <nJoinType> ) // Intersections, Unions & difference

All MachSIx are easily implemented if Bitmap Filter are implemented at harbour RDD kernel.

There are only one thing that is not finished yet. (Rushmore implementation) I don't have
time in this moment to finish it. It uses btree lib to create temporary memory index used
to optimize the expression filter as possible using existing index and btree ones.

Is possible Przemek can help us in Rushmore implementation.

I hope to add Bitmap Filter in a few days at Harbour kernel.
Bitmap filter will be activated with
    SET OPTIMIZE ON
as in Clipper 5.3

I never understood why there was a performance hit if you inherited from 
DBFCDX? Do you have some idea why it is so?

Hi EMG,

Did you try with /contrib/make_b32.bat ?

What is the output? (errors, warnings, anything)

Pls try after an SVN checkout.

Viktor

It's not a big problem, bitmap filters can be implemented too at workarea level
or inheriting from and existing rdd.

In its first implementation i prefer to create a new rdd, because it uses internal
cdx functions api to implement some functions that are more fast results in some
cases.

Of course it can be implemented too using RDD interface instead of internal cdx functions.

How you purpose to implement the next function without duplicating code:

static ERRCODE hb_cdxRecall( CDXAREAP pArea )
{
    if ( SUPER_RECALL( (AREAP) pArea ) == SUCCESS )
    {
       if ( pArea->dbfi.fFilter && pArea->dbfi.fOptimized )
       {
          pArea->dbfi.fFilter = FALSE;
          if ( hb_cdxCheckRecordFilter( pArea, pArea->ulRecNo ) )
               BM_SetBit( ( ( LPBM_FILTER ) pArea->dbfi.lpvCargo)->rmap, ( ( LPBM_FILTER ) pArea->dbfi.lpvCargo)->Size,
                          pArea->ulRecNo );
          else
               BM_ClrBit( ( ( LPBM_FILTER ) pArea->dbfi.lpvCargo)->rmap, ( ( LPBM_FILTER ) pArea->dbfi.lpvCargo)->Size,
                          pArea->ulRecNo );
          pArea->dbfi.fFilter = TRUE;
       }
       return SUCCESS;
    }
    else
       return FAILURE;
}


or

static ERRCODE hb_cdxRecall( CDXAREAP pArea )
{
     if ( SUPER_RECALL( (AREAP) pArea ) == SUCCESS )
     {
         if ( pArea->dbfi.fFilter && pArea->dbfi.fOptimized )
         {
             pArea->dbfi.fFilter = FALSE;
             if ( hb_cdxCheckRecordFilter( pArea, pArea->ulRecNo ) )
                 BM_SetBit( ( ( LPBM_FILTER ) pArea->dbfi.lpvCargo)->rmap, ( ( LPBM_FILTER ) pArea->dbfi.lpvCargo)->Size,
                            pArea->ulRecNo );
             else
                 BM_ClrBit( ( ( LPBM_FILTER ) pArea->dbfi.lpvCargo)->rmap, ( ( LPBM_FILTER ) pArea->dbfi.lpvCargo)->Size,
                            pArea->ulRecNo );
             pArea->dbfi.fFilter = TRUE;
         }
         return SUCCESS;
     }
     else
         return FAILURE;
}


I think that CheckRecordFilter is nedded to add at rdd hierarchy.
some other questions can be resolved using actual rdd api.

I just realize that mkall_b32.bat has been renamed as make_b32_all.bat. 
Anyway, calling the new batch all I get is:

IMHO It should be done in different way. HB_FA_TEMPORARY is hardcoded
workaround for Windows limitations in core xHarbour code. This code is
unusable in other OSes which in most cases does not have such performance
degradation during buffer flush and in non exclusive mode like MS-Windows.
Such feature should be part of hb_fsCreateTemp() function and on POSIX
systems removes all directory links to temporary files so only virtual
bindings will be present giving _real_ (not like in MS-WIN)
"delete on close" functionality.

Rather not. Sorry but I do not have time for it so do not expect
I will work on NULL flags in the nearest future.
But after Miguel will have finished it in xHarbour then we can borrow
new code to Harbour if it will work as expected without side effects.

You asked about separating bitmap filters from current BMDFBCDX code
and it's very easy to add inheritance from pure DBFCDX or DBFNTX.
Method COUNTSCOPE() should be used to determinate if record is in filter,
F.e. using current BM* structures it should look like:

    static ERRCODE hb_bmCountScope( AREAP pArea, void * pPtr, LONG * plRec )
    {
       if( pPtr == NULL )
       {
          LPBM_FILTER pMap = pArea->dbfi.lpvCargo;
          if( pArea->dbfi.fFilter && pMap &&
              !BM_GetBit( pMap->rmap, pMap->Size, ulRecNo ) )
          {
             *plRec = 0;
          }
          return SUCCESS;
       }
       return SUPER_COUNTSCOPE( pArea, pPtr, plRec );
    }

then it's enough to overload few methods:
    SKIPFILTER(), SETFILTER(), CLEARFILTER(),
    INFO(), ORDERINFO(), RDDINFO()
adding basic bitmap filter functionality. This is not a problem.
The most important are BM_*() functions which directly access CDXAREP
structure without respecting RDD API. It has two bad side effects:
They create hardcoded bindings to internal DBFCDX functions and they can
be executed also with other RDDs causing GPF (optimistic situation),
internal RDD structure corrupting or even data files corruption. In short
word if someone by mistake will use BM_* function and current RDD is not
BMDBFCDX (using BMSIXCDX is also dangerous because these functions come
from DMDBFCDX and have hardcoded binding to BMDBFCDX only functions) then
he can cause this RDD crash or data corruption. This have to be fixed first
- we need to keep some level of core code quality.

Sorry guys, I cannot reproduce this, not even after a
complete checkout, either by running the batch file
from Far Manager, or from Explorer.

I see some problems with HB_DLL_DIR though, which I'll fix,
but otherwise this batch file works for me.

Pls tell some more info about your system, sets, the
way you run it, etc, and do a fresh checkout first.

Brgds,
Viktor

OK, I see, it is not a performance issue, but a need for 
improving/extending the api?

I have never used any of these extensions, in 5.3 or 5.2, so despite me 
butting in I am not qualified at all to comment on how/whether that 
should be done.

Okey, as you think, for me NULL support is far from important.

Not "some", but "high" IMO. So these need to be fixed as you say.

BITMAP filter makes one very simple job. For each record in table
one bit is allocated to store information if record pass or not
given filter condition. Then this information is used in SKIP
operation so only _VALID_ records are read from table and others
are ignored. Additionally if record is read and it does not pass
filter condition then it's automatically removed from bitmap so
it will be ignored in next SKIP operation. That's all and this
is rather trivial.
But first you have to mark these valid records in allocated bitmap.
You have three choices:
1. the bitmap is added to workarea "manually" by user and already
   have needed records marked - all bit map filter implementation
   should have such functionality. It's interesting option very
   usable when you also have functions to manipulate record sets,
   f.e. see RL*() functions in CLIPMORE.
2. just after new SET FILTER TO <exp>
   all records are marked as valid and then during SKIP wrong
   records are unset dynamically or at begining of SET FILTER command
   RDD scan whole table from BOF to EOF to exclude wrong records.
   In such way works BMDBFCDX.
3. optimizer analyze <exp> and extracts all parts which are also
   part of existing index expressions and fill record set reading
   only indexes without touching the table. Then if necessary
   (not whole expression was optimized and user enabled such behavior
   - _SET_FORCEOPT in [x]Harbour) it also makes linear table scan
   to verify marked records.
   In such way works MachSIx (be careful if you are SIx3 user because
   this part is seriously broken in this library), CLIPMORE, AOF (ADS),
   RMDBFCDX, RMDBFNTX.
   CLIPMORE and RMDBF* have a feature which allow to introduce additional
   status to marked record called. It allow to reduce the cost of
   record verification process so only "maybe" records are verified.

That's all. Now you can decide when it can give you speed improvement
or when it will reduce the speed and increase memory consumption.
The most visible for user speed improvement is in BROWSE() when
SET FILTER excluding high percent of records is used.

Przemek

Hi,


I remember the argument for putting it to contrib was that it duplicates 
DBFCDX code. So, the question remains the same:

But you haven't answered to this question.

Yes, I'm working on it, and I'm thinking to add at workarea level if is possible.

Then NTX and CDX automatically will work too with bitmap filters only when
SET OPTIMIZE [ON].

I hope to upload it in a few days.

By the moment only bitmap filters.

I've in development Rushmore as CLIPMORE and SIx. (I don't have enough time to
finish it :( )


m6 library will be implemented too easily when I upload BM filters.

I agree
If I understand on MS-Windows hb_fsCreateTemp() will use this flag.

I'm working now with it, I hope to upload to xharbour in a few days,

Yes it can goes perfectly, I try it.

And then set fCheckFilter to FALSE in function hb_cdxDBOIKeyCount when BM filter exists and is active.

I hope to change BM_ or elimitate it. If I add bitmap filter at workarea level, this functions can be
isolated in an independence library or better create m6_Filter functions.

All this functions of bm rdd can be implemented at workarea. or not?

Hi Marek,

Ops, I have about 50 pending fixes not yet committed.

I didn't answer yet, because I couldn't go through
your proposed changes, but I think they make the
whole process too complicated, and tie together
the BC/VC make processes too much.

:(

Do you mind if I go on with my modifications?

Brgds,
Viktor

The main difference between what we have had so far and what
we have now is totaly new "make all contribs" system. Before
we had one batch file which called a second, "helper" batch
file and everything was done in the same "command processor"
process. That is why Enrico got errors making all contribs.
In fact, when build process reached the second dir, enviro
has been already wrong. Not to mention the last one ! :)

Now "make all contribs" is done thru another makefile which
implements MAKE, CLEAN and INSTALL rules, common for all
buildable contrib dirs, and it eliminates building dirs
requiring aditional settings (firebird, gd, freeimage, etc.).

The unification of BCC and MSVC is not as deep as you think.
In fact it takes place only in mtpl_rules.mak file. And it
eliminates duplicate work if rules for CLEAN and INSTALL are
modified. This is a great benefit, because modifing similar,
however different, rules in both makefiles it tedious and error
prone ( I know, i tried it :) ). Now it's enough to modify one
file and both compilers should work ok.

Yet another benefit is that now make process for all contribs
fails if one of them is not buildable. Before, despite an error
in one of dirs, the build process continued. I find it usefull,
because otherwise there is no info that something went wrong.

> Do you mind if I go on with my modifications?

Sure, I guess they will not interact too much with current
version, because the core (individual make process) is not
too different :).

Message-ID: <9257026e0711210939t24348662j1242e000f419349b@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a clean way to check if a gt has the clipboard support?

For example my apps can be used with gtxwc that has CLIPBOARD support
and gttrm that has not and I'fd like to check it at runtime.

BTW under C53B to simulate CLIPBOARD I use a static var that is set
with COPY and get with PASTE.

Could this approach be used at GT level instead of PRG one when thr GT
doesn't support CLIPBOARD?

Often it is useful to cut/copy memoedit content even inside the same app.

best regards,
Lorenzo

I've fixed Enrico's problem in an other way which doesn't
need any make file level fixes. I was about to commit them :)

Well, the problem is that you now need special switches
to run make .exe, and if we want to add a new compiler
to the mix, we will end up in a real mess.

I'd like to keep it as simple and clean as possible.
(it's already more complicated than I'd like it to be)

Actually, I just tried this today, I got the "help" message
for each contrib which didn't succeed, and I think this is
much friendlier approach than stopping on each error, as
most users won't have every required dependencies, yet they
may want to build what is possible to be built on their
system. So stopping may be an option, but since it requires
more and more sophisticated logic to implement, I'm not
sure this is the way to go.

I'm trying to keep every feature, but I'd like to keep
the INSTALL and CLEAN rules separate for VC and BC, I'd
appreciate if you could help me on that. We'd need rules
which work with make.exe and nmake.exe respectively
without any special command line switches, like -N or -r.

My other problem is that the updated CLEAN/INSTALL rules
don't work for me, I've tried with VC. Something to do
with the new %%COMPSPEC%% var.

Could you help in these?

Brgds,
Viktor

We ARE in a real mess already. Due to -r requirement.

Sorry Viktor, did you try to compile hbzlib without -r
on Win2003 ? If no, I suggest you to do it.

Sorry again, it is only your opinion. Mine is totaly different.

Then you have to take the responsibility for modifying
them because I don't like duplicative work at all.

Hi Enrico,

No :).

The first set of messages comes from your CALL make_b32_all clean
command. The second one comes from your CALL make_b32_all command.

So every seems to be OK :).

Hi,


for the last half year I always use hbrun.exe to solve problems like 
this. For example:

PROC main(cFileName)
   MEMOWRIT(cFileName, STRTRAN(MEMOREAD(cFileName), CHR(9), SPACE(8)))
RETURN

And of cause EOF character in the end of result file is the most 
annoying. Do we have some "MEMOWRITE" function without this extra character?


Best regards,
Mindaugas

No, it doesn't seem so. The time needed for the first and the second set of 
messages was equal while cleaning should be much faster than compiling. 
Anyway, now the situation is totally changed again...

You can strip it with hb_StrShrink( c, 1 ), but the
tab expansion in this manner is not correct, see this
case:
//<TAB>Something aligned
will be:
//        Something aligned
should be:
//      Something aligned

I can recommend this GNU tool I've found today:
expand --tabs=8 < in > out

The annoying char was actually used by CPM to signal
the end of file in days when the disk-subsystem was
only able to server full clusters (sectors?), and
didn't know about the exact file length :)

K_SH_TAB works with "xterm" but not with "linux" is it expected?

I don't thing, it will help to reach the goal: create file without extra 
character.

I know, I hope you'll be able to extend my 3 lines sample into 7 lines 
sample, to do the right tab expansion.
But the main idea was, that it's very usefull to use a few line harbour 
script, to do some easy parsing of file, etc.

Hi,


I've never used bitmap filters, and I do not know that countScope() and 
some other related methods do, but I have a feeling that copying 
waSkipFilter to bmSkipFilter and this tiny change of the code will 
implement the core part of BM support (skipping over BM filter and 
dynamic BM creation).

if( pArea->dbfi.itmCobExpr && hb_rbmGetBit( pMap, pArea->ulRecNo ) )
{
    pResult = hb_vmEvalBlock( pArea->dbfi.itmCobExpr );
    if( HB_IS_LOGICAL( pResult ) && !hb_itemGetL( pResult ) )
    {
       hb_rbmClearBit( pMap, pArea->ulRecNo );
       if( SELF_SKIPRAW( pArea, lUpDown ) != SUCCESS )
          return FAILURE;
       continue;
    }
}

The more difficult job is filter expression analysis and index usage for 
BM optimization.

Exactly. RDD which will overload SKIPFILTER() method adding above
code is enough for the most trivial bitmap filter implementation.
Overloading COUNTSCOPE() can give some speed improvement in local
access when file IO is not the most expensive operation and it's
not strictly necessary. SETFILTER() and CLEARFILTER() overloading
is necessary to create/destroy bitmap attached to workarea. If you
also want to add support for DBI_RM_* and RDDI_RECORDMAP then it's
necessary to overload INFO() and RDDINFO(). Because we have inside
DBFCDX some wrong code which check normal filter condition in some
of DBOI_* actions (this is the part of code I have been saying that
should be removed for last years) then it will be necessary to
overload also ORDERINFO() to temporary disable filter expression
before calling SUPER_ORDERINFO() and then restore it. Depending
on implementation it maybe good to overload also PUTREC() to catch
record modifications and maybe SKIP() to improve skipping without
active index.

That's all. We do not need any modifications in workarea code.
IMHO it's probably the most trivial part of whole record map
implementation and it's sth what I was asking Miguel from beginning.
It will help to keep the code clean.

What I suspect is the libs we are linking do not have above functions with

I didn't try it yet, but I think we will need
to rename gtwvt.c to gtwvg.c to avoid clashing with
the gtwvt.obj created by core. This is needed
for the non-GNU make system. To stay consistent
I'd recommend renaming gtwvt.h to gtwvg.h.

    * removed some unused code and redirect some methods to common

      Pritpal this code needs cleanup. Now it's xHarbour GT hacked
      to compile and link with Harbour API. It means that this code
      also inherited some small incompatibilities to Clipper which
      exists in xHarbour GTs. If you agree I'll try to systematically
      clean it and as I can see IMO the final version will look like
      GTWVT in core code plus some additional code so it can be quite
      easy separated. Probably with some small modifications in GTWVT it
      will be possible to remove these two files from GTWVG at all
      changing GTWVG to inherit from core GTWVT. Such separation will
      also show what is core GT code and what is GUI Windows extension
      what should help in defining common multi platform API.

MEMOWRIT() accepts an optional third parameter which indicates whether 
an EOF should be written.  If the third parameter is .Y., EOF is 
written; if .N., it is not written; the default value is .Y.

Hi Kevin,

Seems useful but the implementation is wrong,
since this is a "hidden" extension we try to
avoid.

I'd suggest adding hb_MemoWrit() with this
extended functionality, and mark this one
with HB_EXTENSION.

Brgds,
Viktor

Probably but before you will try to compile it for WinCE then this code
should be fixed to work well with Unicode even on standard Windows.
Try to compile GTWVG for W32 but with UNICODE macro set (-DUNICODE)
and you will find many warnings which will inform you that it needs
to be fixed. When it will be done and GTWVG compiled with UNICODE
macro can be used in normal W32 then we can try to port it to WINCE
and check which functions are missing.
Please remember that making code ready for UNICDE W32 API does not mean
that you only have to add casting to pacify warnings. You have to make
conversions from/to character strings to unicode strings. Casting to
LP[C]TSTR in most of cases only hides places which should be fixed
(you will find lot of MS-Win code in [x]Harbour where is used in such
buggy way) so I suggest to not use it.

Przemek,
This is the most important at least for me. Until now there are more than 30
different Gts, a lot of them are almost the same. It will be nice sometime
in the future all this Gt's to inherit some base functionality. Also we can
provide a base GT that will have windows - xWindows common api and why not
web.

Probably but before you will try to compile it for WinCE then this code
should be fixed to work well with Unicode even on standard Windows.
Try to compile GTWVG for W32 but with UNICODE macro set (-DUNICODE)
and you will find many warnings which will inform you that it needs
to be fixed. When it will be done and GTWVG compiled with UNICODE
macro can be used in normal W32 then we can try to port it to WINCE
and check which functions are missing.
Please remember that making code ready for UNICDE W32 API does not mean
that you only have to add casting to pacify warnings. You have to make
conversions from/to character strings to unicode strings. Casting to
LP[C]TSTR in most of cases only hides places which should be fixed
(you will find lot of MS-Win code in [x]Harbour where is used in such
buggy way) so I suggest to not use it.
>>>>>>>

I know this fact, but alas I am not proficient with string conversions. I
followed your changes in gtwvt.c and tried to achieve something alike but
was sure that I was not doing right things. I am trying to learn it but may
be I do not succeed. If you do me a favour in this regard I will feel highly
oblidged and will learn a lot this way.

  * harbour/source/rtl/gtwvt/gtwvt.c
    * formatting

  * harbour/contrib/gtwvg/gtwvt.h
  * harbour/contrib/gtwvg/gtwvt.c
    * removed some unused code and redirect some methods to common
      for all MS-Win GTs functions.
      Pritpal this code needs cleanup. Now it's xHarbour GT hacked
      to compile and link with Harbour API. It means that this code
      also inherited some small incompatibilities to Clipper which
      exists in xHarbour GTs. If you agree I'll try to systematically
      clean it and as I can see IMO the final version will look like
      GTWVT in core code plus some additional code so it can be quite
      easy separated. Probably with some small modifications in GTWVT it
      will be possible to remove these two files from GTWVG at all
      changing GTWVG to inherit from core GTWVT. Such separation will
      also show what is core GT code and what is GUI Windows extension
      what should help in defining common multi platform API.

When I designed those functions I was very limited in knowledge on the

Message-ID: <4745FD06.3070301@yahoo.com.br>

Hi,

The example below is creating a file fm.log:

File: test1.prg

procedure main ()

    ? "Hello World"

    inkey(0)

return

procedure hb_gtsys ()
request hb_gt_wvg
return

File: fm.log

"0700000070000000000000000000000070000000"
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another question: to run test1.exe, i need to do:

test1.exe //gt:wvg

How to run only with test1.exe (without //gt:wvg) ?

I am compiling Harbour with default values. I only do:

cd harbour
make_b32.bat clean
make b32.bat
make b32.bat install

  * harbour/contrib/gtwvg/wvtcore.c
    ! fixed hb_wvt_gtDlgProcMLess() and hb_wvt_gtDlgProcModal()
      - fixed GPF when codeblock are used
      - use hb_vmPushNumInt() instead of hb_vmPushLong() to push
        handles and numbers with potentially unknown size.
        I still suggest to use pointers ITEMs instead of converting
        handles to numbers but I'm leaving such modifications to library
        authors - using hb_vmPushNumInt() is a workaround for striping
        highest 32 bit from handles by hb_vmPushLong() in XP64 
      - use hb_vmRequestReenter() / hb_vmRequestRestore() to avoid crash
        when function/codeblock is executed during HVM has been serving
        an exception (f.e. BREAK/QUIT/RETURN)

       Implemented -j[filename] switch to indicate output filename. Default

       is created in speficied output path.
       Output file format is compatible with 'gettext' utils, but not all
       available features are implemented.
       Harbour level function HB_i18nGettext( cText [, cContext ] ) sould be
       used to indicate translatable strings.
       All this commit is commented using #ifdef HB_I18N_SUPPORT and is in
       development stage. Please, do not use it yet.

=====================================================================

Hi,


I've added i18n support to the compiler. To not reinvent the wheel, 
gettext utils compatible files are generated, as suggested by Przemek.

No, runtime code is added. I think this will require discussion. 
Perhaps, Unix user will want to use standard library, but it will be not 
good solution for windows users, because it will require libiconv.dll 
and libintl.dll.
Can anyone give a good idea to solve this? Do we have users of gettext 
on the list?

I'm going to write a small utility to compile .po, to xHarbour .hit 
format, as my own temporary solution. Or even more simple to implement 
"serialized hash" format:
   STATIC s_i18nTable
   PROC HB_i18nSetLanguage( cLanguage )
      s_i18nTable := HB_DESERIALIZE(MEMOREAD(cLanguage + ".mo"))
   RETURN
   FUNC HB_i18nGettext( cText )
   RETURN s_i18nTable[ cText ]

The whole i18n code is commented using #ifdef HB_I18N_SUPPORT, to not 
introduce a new features until beta release.

I selected HB_i18n*() namespace, because HB_gettext_getext(), 
HB_gettext_dpgettext(), etc. looks is a little ugly. BTW, usually we do 
not terminate prefix by underscore. So, HB_gettextgetext() and 
HB_gettextdpgettext() will be even more ugly. We are free to change 
prefix before we'll make this i18n support public, by removing #ifdef 
HB_I18N_SUPPORT.


Best regards,
Mindaugas

hb_i18n is fine, but let's please add an underscore after it,
to make it readable and separate our prefix from the
gettext namespace (and naming style): hb_i18n_*() -> hb_i18n_gettext()

I see no problem with hb_i18n_*() also, I just wanted to follow the same 
rules. We have hb_inet*(), etc. I use hb_lowerUpper() to separate 
prefix. So, hb_i18nGettext() looks pretty well. But, I have no objection 
here, because hb_i18nGettext() will usually be hidden under: _("some 
string"). Of cause, we will have some i18n functions written explicitly: 
hb_i18nTextdomain(), hb_i18nSetlocale(), etc.

FYI, quite a while ago I tried using these functions (in xHarbour) for memo editing (using textboxes). 
However, there were cases that they don't function properly in Win98. IIRC even the samples in 
xHarbour CVS do not work properly in Win98.

Since I don't know how to fix them, I simply stopped trying to use them and created native textboxes 
into gtwvw.

(All the above are in the context of xHarbour. I haven't got a chance to try Harbour for a long time :-()

That's okey, but remember that the original gettext API uses
the fully-lower style, and I think we should replicate it here,
since this is essentially the same API. Also "i18n" is by itself
quite a strange "word" to read, which gets worse if something is
appended to it without some visual separator.

So my vote so far for this:

hb_i18n_setlocale()
hb_i18n_bindtextdomain()
hb_i18n_textdomain()
hb_i18n_gettext()
hb_i18n_dgettext()
hb_i18n_ngettext()
hb_i18n_dngettext()

(and the disadvantage is still easy to see, that we're
implementing one specific i18n implementation under this
generic prefix. This might cause problems when we want
to implement an alternative i18n library in Harbour.
Let's say the one native to OS X, or some future
sucessor of gettext())

Some other alternatives which - to some extent - seem to
solve this issue:

hb_iget_*()
hb_igtx_*()

Brgds,
Viktor

IMHO it's a feature. I can use many different implementation
but I do not plan to rewrite my code so any other alternative
implementation have to cover some basic functionality and use
the same API.

> Let's say the one native to OS X, or some future
> sucessor of gettext())

Fine. New implementation will also have to use the same prefix
giving similar basic functionality or adding it will be waste
of time because it will force existing code rewriting.
And such situation we will have at startup - probably native support
for gettext in *nixes and our own solution for MS-WIN and other
platforms where gettext is not default part of OS.

In such context i18n is perfect choice and I do not see any reason
to create problems in the place where we do not have them yet ;-)
If someone will be interested in GETTEXT wrapper only not multiplatform
translation system then of course he can chose 'gettext' prefix.

Viktor,

Many thanks for your modifications but you will have to rename libmisc
directory to hbmisc or remove libmisc/test from default GNU make build
because CONTRIBS libraries should have the same name as directory in
./contrib tree. It looks like we have the same problem also with libct.
And if you can please rename ./contrib/hbzlib directory to
./contrib/hbziparch

Hi Mindaugas,

I still haven't received you 1-st message so I can see it only at
http://lists.harbour-project.org/pipermail/harbour/

Many thanks for it - it's very important feature in current days.
I agree that it will be good to have alternative implementation
which will not use gettext library in final binaries. The most
important feature with gettext is the fact the many people know it
and there is a lot of different tools which can help in translations.
If we can keep compatibility on translation level then what we use
in final binaries is less important.

I am sorry Viktor, but I guess you didn't even test your changes.
It's enough to add "set > set.log" after "set HB_EXIT_LEVEL=" in
contrib/mtpl_b32.bat and contrib/mtpl_vc.bat, run make_b32_all.bat,
go to xhb dir and see "set.log" file to see that you are *completly 
wrong* (see CFLAGS for example). Unfortunately you broke the whole 
contrib make system now :(.

>      ! Some other smaller fixes.

Sorry again, but now CLEAN rule is ezecuted *twice* under MSVC.
It's enough to add the following line :

    @$(ECHO) @echo In %1 directory          >> _hbdeloo.bat

just after 

    @$(ECHO) @echo off                       > _hbdeloo.bat

in doClean rule in mtpl_vc.mak and "rem"ark deleting make_vc.log in
mtpl_vc.bat to see this (in make_vc.log).

Looking at your changes I get a feeling that you do not know side
effects of "command processor's" behavoir, as well as "nmake.exe"
behavior.

strlen( hb_parc( 6 ) ) in most case will give the same results until
you are not using language with multibyte characters. You can use:
    lstrlen( text );

it will work for both normal and Unicode mode and will be a little bit
faster then:
    strlen( hb_parc( 6 ) )

Hi Przemek,

No problem.
Okey I will revise the (folder or lib) names according to this rule.

I know, sorry, I've overlooked this one. In fact
I always have the notion (by the name) that
this is a non-GNU make file.

Message-ID: <9257026e0711230317xdffd4b5pa004c0a8af892b66@mail.gmail.com>

Almost every Gts has these lines inside:

#define K_SH_LEFT            K_LEFT   /* Shift-Left  == Left  */
#define K_SH_UP              K_UP     /* Shift-Up    == Up    */
#define K_SH_RIGHT           K_RIGHT  /* Shift-Right == Right */
#define K_SH_DOWN            K_DOWN   /* Shift-Down  == Down  */
#define K_SH_INS             K_INS    /* Shift-Ins   == Ins   */
#define K_SH_DEL             K_DEL    /* Shift-Del   == Del   */
#define K_SH_HOME            K_HOME   /* Shift-Home  == Home  */
#define K_SH_END             K_END    /* Shift-End   == End   */
#define K_SH_PGUP            K_PGUP   /* Shift-PgUp  == PgUp  */

#define K_SH_RETURN          K_RETURN /* Shift-Enter == Enter */
#define K_SH_ENTER           K_ENTER  /* Shift-Enter == Enter */

Could be added to inkey.ch and removed from the GTs?

( since I use "real" K_SH_ values I need to remove them from every GT
every time I'd like to test the svn )

Lorenzo

Hi Lorenzo,

These are still incompatible and dummy #defines to be
included in core inkey.ch. So I vote no.

What is the point in defining synoyms to existing keys
in our code?

If anything they could be included in hbapigt.h, but
the point is hard to see for me there either.

The other "hack" is to add a #define (HB_GT_NO_CUSTOM_SH_KEYS)
which - if defined - would disable the inclusion of these
#defines.

Brgds,
Viktor

See current source/rtl/gtwvt/gtwvt.h, update in similar way
above definitions in other GTs which have them and commit it.

These keys are used in all GTs simply they are mapped to "standard"
keys to be compatible with existing Clipper code.

For example in source/rtl/gtwvt.c there is:

...
               hb_gt_wvt_TranslateKey( K_LEFT , K_SH_LEFT , K_ALT_LEFT
, K_CTRL_LEFT  );
...

in gtcrs.c there is:

...
   {K_LEFT,      K_ALT_LEFT,   K_CTRL_LEFT, K_SH_LEFT}, /*  14 */
...

and so on so removing them is impossible.

What we can choose is simply keep them in one palce or duplicate in many places.

Lorenzo

Hi Ciro,

You can only find this in the original, free NANFOR sources.
(see Phil's Oasis site)

It contains a DOS/DMPI specific (non-portable) interface,
so it's not included in Harbour, just like peek.c itself
is excluded from the build processes, until someone
implements it in a multiplatform way, which is difficult
- if possible at all - considering the function's purpose.

Brgds,
Viktor

2) If compiled with -DUNICODE, box characters are not shown.

3) Application always GPF's at EXIT. I link with XHB.lib too.

Hi,


I see you've just deleted space character, i.e. changed:
   memmove( & pI18n->pString[ ulLeft + 1 ], ....
to:
   memmove( &pI18n->pString[ ulLeft + 1 ], ....

What is the difference between these two expressions? How can this space 
cause GPF? I've put a space just because of coding style, like:
   * pInt = 123;
vs.
   *pInt = 123;

Two lines below I wrote:
   pString = & pI18n->pString[ uiLeft ];
Should I delete space here also?

BTW, long time ago I've seen you had been changed:
    pSomeArray + iIndex
to:
    &pSomeArray[ iIndex ]
What is the difference?

Thanks, I was going to use PHB_FNAME pointer here, but later changed to 
structure, and forgot to change variable nane.

Of cause hb_strdup() is better here, but do we have security issue in 
this code. I understand strcpy() is dangerous because of possible 
destination string overflow. But it is not the case in code:
    pString->szContext = ( char* ) hb_xgrab( strlen( szContext ) + 1 ); 	
    strcpy( pString->szContext, szContext );
Do we have some other security issues here?

You have to use FUNCTION HB_GTSYS() in Harbour.
(or FUNCTION GTSYS() is also good if you use xhb.ch)

Please check once again this memmove() and what was inside sizeof()
before my commit.

Spaces and formatting is only my habit and side effect of code editing
I usually remove spaces after & used as unary reference operator to avoid
confusion with bit & but it has nothing to GPF which was caused by typo
in sizeof() argument.

again habit, due to different operator precendence depending on context
I'm using both versions. Sometime is easier to use &ptr[<exp>] instead
of ptr + <exp> because you can eliminate normal () parentheses.

I know it was safe but now whole code is clean so we can immediately
catch all new potentially dangerous code. Few years ago in [x]Harbour
core code was hundreds of strcpy()/strcat() and it was not possible
to easy locate dangerous places. I cleaned it and I want to keep it
in such way or in next few years we will have again hundreds of warning
ignored by all of us.

Oh, yes! :) Thanks, for fix. I'm surprised my code was working, for a 
simple tests I've made.

OK.

It's good that everything is clear know. Because I've just started to 
have a feeling I know nothing about C: spaces are important, strcpy to 
good-size allocated buffer is insecure, etc... :)

Hi,


I think it's good to change contrib folder name to hbziparch (or 
hbziparc if we want to follow 8.3 convention).

This will allow to put real hbzlip library in properly named folder.

Viktor,

To run programs compiled with gtwvg.lib, i need to do:

filename.exe //gt:wvg

The same with gtwvt.lib:

filename.exe //gt:wvt

Can you or other developer confirm if this is the correct way ?


Thanks!

Przemek,
I'm working (Locally for now) on an extended version of gtwvw for xHarbour.
Is there any list of functions like strcpy->hb_strncpy and
strcat->hb_strncat so I will change all this functions to the correct ones
in gtwvw? Also until now I haven't port my application to Harbour due to
RMDBFCDX GTWVW and Winapi. I already own an xHarbour subscription, so is it
possible to use rmdbfcdx.lib from xHarbour with Harbour and what about the
other 2 (GTWVW, Winapi). I don't have any problem with extensions because
until now I'm using only clipper compatible code. 

Thanks in advance
Mike Evans

Yes, there a few plans to rename some contrib dirs,
but I'm waiting for confirmation from Przemek, if
I understand correctly that the contrib dir name
must be the same as the lib name for the GNU make
system to work properly.

Here is the plan for renaming (all open for debate):

Current     Current       Proposed    Proposed
DIR         LIBNAME       DIR         LIBNAME
----------- ------------- ----------- -------------
btree       hbbtree       hbbtree
directx     hbwin32ddrw   hbwin32ddrw
freeimage   hbfreeimage   hbfreeimage (*1)
gd          hbgd          hbgd
hbzlib      hbziparch     hbziparch
hgf/gtk     hbgtk         hgf/gtk     hgfgtk? (TOFIX)
hgf/os2pm   os2pm         hgf/os2pm   hgfos2? (TOFIX)
hgf/win32                 hgf/win32   hgfwin32? (TODO)

libnf       nf            hbnf        hbnf
msql                      hbmsql      hbmsql

odbc        hbodbc        hbodbc
ole         hbole         hbole
pdflib      hbpdflib      hbpdflib
pgsql       hbpg          hbpgsql     hbpgsql
rdd_ads     rddads        rddads
win32       hbwin32       hbwin32

(*1) freeimage is the name of the original lib,
so it must be something else. (hb libname was fi_lib)

8.3 naming convention is harder and harder to maintain,
outside the core, and DOS is less and less supported in
our contribs, quite some contribs already broke this rule,
so we may give it up for contribs completely.

Brgds,
Viktor

Yes, this is one of the correct ways.

You can also use //gtwvg, //gtwvt, and you can set
the default from your program too, using:
ANNOUNCE hb_gt_wvg_default()

or using hbmk or hblnk -gt* parameter, f.e.:

    hblnk myprg1.o myprg2.o -gtwvg -gtwin -gtwvt -gtstd -gtcgi -o myapp

creates myapp with 6 GTs (GTNUL is always linked as part of core code)
and GTWVG (first -gt* parameter) is set as default one.

Using "ANNOUNCE hb_gt_wvg_default" i can run the program directly 
(without //gtwvg or //gt:wvg).

No. If source code contains HB_GTSYS symbol then it's not needed.
Add to your code
    ANNOUNCE HB_GTSYS
to disable linking default GT driver. It does not have to be GTWIN but
the one which was set as default during Harbour compilation (f.e. in
HB_GT_LIB).

adding:
    REQUEST HB_GT_<name>
forces linking other GT drivers. You can link with you application
more then one GT driver and switch between them. If you use more
then one GT driver then you can chose default one by using
    REQUEST HB_GT_<name>_DEFAULT
f.e.:
    REQUEST HB_GT_STD
    REQUEST HB_GT_WIN
    REQUEST HB_GT_GUI
    REQUEST HB_GT_WVT_DEFAULT
    REQUEST HB_GT_WVG

When you run your application you can chose other then default GT
using //gt<name> switch or HB_GT envvar.
Please read doc/gtapi.txt

> 2) If compiled with -DUNICODE, box characters are not shown.

GTWVG is not unicode ready yet. Try GTWVT and please remember that
using HB_SETTERMCP() you can set default encoding for your terminal
and application.

> 3) Application always GPF's at EXIT. I link with XHB.lib too.

Please create self contain example so maybe I'll help. I do not
think it's Harbour core code or base of XHB library. IMO it's GTWVG
problem or some other code. Without example I cannot help. If you
are using MinGW then if you compile Harbour with -g C compiler switch
and then link without stripping debug information (-nostrip hblnk/hbmk
parameter) then you can try to catch GPF using GDB. run you application
in GDB by:
    gdb ./yourapp <params>
then use gdb commands:
    r	// start program
when it GPF
    bt  // show backtrace C call stack

and you should see where it stops to work.

Hi all,

I'd like to get some opinions on hbmake / hbdoc.

Both seems to be pretty bug ridden and not well
maintained (seems so even after refreshing to the
latest xhb version).

IMO hbmake should somehow be "refactored" to reach
a certain level of quality.

hbdoc on the other hand could be replaced by some
standard doc generating tool, so that we don't have
to deal with the development of the tool itself.
Some possible (free, GPL) alternatives:

robodoc (HTML, DocBook, TXT, LaTeX, PDF, RTF outputs)
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROBODoc
	http://www.xs4all.nl/~rfsber/Robo/robodoc.html
doxygen (HTML, LaTeX, man, RTF, XML, CHM, PS, PDF)
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen
	http://www.doxygene.org/

robodoc would need less reformatting of our current
docs, doxygen has a wider output support, but both are
able to produce most modern doc type outputs, see the
links for more.

Opinions (and contributors) are welcome.

Brgds,
Viktor

I forgot to note that hbdoc source is also very
messy and has some fatal bugs which makes it choke
on certain files inside Harbour. So even if'd decide
to keep, it would need some work to fix it.

A 3rd choice could be some 3rd party tools which
can extract our NANFOR (I guess) formatted docs.

I'm trying to use /* */ only, but old habits.... :)

I don't thing we need to make complicated switches and we can generate 
compile time warnings by default.
I not sure, if string should be literal. Someone can try to use i18n as 
dictionary:
   ACCEPT "Enter word:" TO cWord
   ? hb_i18n_gettext( cWord )
It's just an idea.

My suggestion is made something  as additive for hbmake so hbmake will work with this actual mde
/ PDH Project  Definition Harbour - File created by hbmake Version 2.0  Date: 21.10.08 Time: 15:32:27
COMPRESS = NO
WARNINGLEVEL =  0
COMPILE_FLAG = -DEURO 
GUI = YES
OBJ = objpath
[myproject.exe] = myprg1.prg ,myprg2.prg, my sample prg3.prg, mytest.ch mysamplec.c ,express.res, lang.lib ,vm.lib, rtl.lib, pcrepos.lib, rdd.lib, macro.lib, pp.lib, dbfntx.lib, bmdbfcdx.lib, dbfcdx.lib, dbffpt.lib  ,hbsix.lib ,common.lib,gtwvt.lib, codepage.lib ,ct.lib ,tip.lib ,rddads.lib ,ace32.lib, c:\mypath\mylib.lib ,wvtgui.lib

IMO no other variable is necessary in hbmake
This project definition pdh is Simple to create, simple to post on ng


hbmake -pc myproject.pdh  // for project compiling
hbmake -pc myproject.pdh  // wizard for create  new project
hbmake -pf  myproject.pdh  // for complete rebuild project
hbmake -p show pdh createted for compile (in future list of phd will start with hbmake without parameter)

<<<<<<<<<<<<
No. If source code contains HB_GTSYS symbol then it's not needed.
Add to your code
    ANNOUNCE HB_GTSYS
to disable linking default GT driver. It does not have to be GTWIN but
the one which was set as default during Harbour compilation (f.e. in
HB_GT_LIB).

adding:
    REQUEST HB_GT_<name>
forces linking other GT drivers. You can link with you application
more then one GT driver and switch between them. If you use more
then one GT driver then you can chose default one by using
    REQUEST HB_GT_<name>_DEFAULT
f.e.:
    REQUEST HB_GT_STD
    REQUEST HB_GT_WIN
    REQUEST HB_GT_GUI
    REQUEST HB_GT_WVT_DEFAULT
    REQUEST HB_GT_WVG

When you run your application you can chose other then default GT
using //gt<name> switch or HB_GT envvar.
Please read doc/gtapi.txt
>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I was clear about this, just missed the function name HB_GTSYS() and wrote
it GT_SYS() and without checking for the info, just posted this message.
Sorry for that (Victor).

<<<<<<<<<<<
GTWVG is not unicode ready yet. Try GTWVT and please remember that
using HB_SETTERMCP() you can set default encoding for your terminal
and application.
>>>>>>>>>>>

Though I do not need it right now but I was fixing it as per your guidlines.
You are right, with gtwvt box characters are shown correct even non pocketPC
when compiled with MinGW-CE. But ultimately I will be neededg gtwvg for
pocketPC, so tell me what I should look into gtwvg to make it UNICODE
compliant.

<<<<<<<<<<
Please create self contain example so maybe I'll help. I do not
think it's Harbour core code or base of XHB library. IMO it's GTWVG
problem or some other code. Without example I cannot help. If you
are using MinGW then if you compile Harbour with -g C compiler switch
and then link without stripping debug information (-nostrip hblnk/hbmk
parameter) then you can try to catch GPF using GDB. run you application
in GDB by:
    gdb ./yourapp <params>
then use gdb commands:
    r	// start program
when it GPF
    bt  // show backtrace C call stack
and you should see where it stops to work.

My observation:

In the WM_TIMER the code is still being executed at the time of EXITing the
application. At that stage all references to the symbol tables are already
freed. RECEIVESERVER() is accessed every 10 ms and code it is executing is
related with INET*() functions.

I tried to kill the timer before exiting, issued ThreadSleep(300) but this
too did not work either. Maybe the code still being executed in the timer is
not finished IMO.

Hope it may solve some issues related with the timers.

Oh, now I remember, it was because of this GPF I commented out 
case WM_TIMER: 
from gtwvt's wndProc.

This is the the time to fix it.

Subject: [Harbour] Showcasing GTWGM - Multi Console Terminal
Message-ID: <13929958.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello Everybody

Here is a prototype to achieve multi-window terminal. 

The package consists of files to create gtwgm.lib, demowgm.prg and
demowgm.exe ( for fast testing ).

I know that this is a very primitive approach, mostly to retain existing
code. I understand that GT gurus can do it in a much better way, but I am
presenting here an initiative to move to this direction if everybody support
this development. I am pretty sure, all alone, I cannot carry this protocol
to perfection as many other factors in the compiler must have to support it
and I am not conversant to those. I need the group support to fulfil this
dream.

This proto is present in Xbase++. Their modal can be taken into
consideration while building our own.

How to test:
1) Run demowgm.exe
2) Start typing into the window
3) Press F2 to activate another Window
4) Start typing into that window
5) Click on main window, keep typing
6) F2, another window
7) Select windows by clicking onto them and keep typing
8) Have typing message unique to each window
9) ESCape in any window to terminate the appln.

It is just that but amply promises that multi-window GT can be a reality in
Harbour. 

How GT is designed:
1) Every GT command is tied to a window <int iWindow>.
2) <int iWindow> has been made the last parameter in every command and
defaults to current window in focus or the main window ( 0=Zero ).
3) hb_WOpen() is called to open a new window.
3) In the WndProc it is detected which window is receiving input focus and
which one display focus.

Here are the archieves:

This is exactly my dream Compliment for your prototype
Other dream is 
-having a Gt for mix console,gui,web application
-using MDI with gt
-Capability of add a gui area inside or outside of console form. So you
can add for example a treeview right of your console area.

Modernize
Compatibility

  * harbour/contrib/gtwvg/wvtcore.c
    ! fixed setting default foreground and background color when user
      does not pass it's own one. Previous versions was using _s->background
      and _s->foreground - it was wrong because this variables in all
      GTWVT base GTs (also in xHarbour) contains not default color but
      the color recently used to redraw some part of screen - f.e. after
      exposing some region - it means that they can have any value.
      Such bugs are hard to locate because the same program can be executed
      many times without any problem and suddenly he will use wrong colors
      drawing sth - if you observed such effect then it can be the results
      of the above problem. Now default color is taken from core GT code.
      Two functions make it: hb_wvt_FgColorParam() and hb_wvt_BgColorParam()
      Both accept also colors passed as standard Clipper strings.
      The same should be also fixed in xHarbour just like the problem with
      executing registered user functions when HVM is closing fixed in
      previous commit - even if now it does not cause GPF (due to race
      condition it may be exploited only sometimes) then it does not mean
      it works correctly.

Hi Pritpal,
many thanks I'll look at it but first I'd like to finish some
modifications in current GTWVG code. Because I do not receive
all messages from this list (Phil, is it possible to tune mail
sender to be a little bit more aggressive?) then I'll write
here about some things.
Thanks for the confirmation that the problem with GPF on close
has been resolved, I expected it will help. Please remeber that
this problem exists also in xHarbour and should be fixed too.
It's possible that now it does not GPF because it's a race
conditions so some timings are important but it can be exploited
in any moment.
If so far it is working for you then in next commit I would like
to acitvate Harbour GT core code because now not everything works
as it should. This modification will probably interact with multi
window interface you are working on forcing some changes but the
final code should be much easier to manage.
I also plan to make some modification in GT API so it will be possible
to have thread independent console windows. I'm leaving these
modifications and some others to the moment when we realese version
1.0 - I do not want to repeat situation when modifications in devel
branch caused that users stop to be interested in BETA one because
they wanted to use new features.
And this is realy important problem.

Phil, if we do not increase the speed of releasing version 1.0 then
this branch will die again and it will be necessary to make next
full synchronization. I stop to believe that I can work on devel
branch and it will cause no effect on beta one. Practice shows
that each new feature in devel reduce number of people interested
in beta code and version 1.0 - with some seldom exception the quality
of both branches in enough for production environment and people used
to use devel code for it. We really need to set some time lines because
developers cannot work for years to add new features and if they start
to work on devel then it will be very hard to find someone interested
in beta even to create binaries for next release.

Take your own time. I have stopped further development on GTWGM until you
examine the protocol I am employing as me too is not yet satified what I am
doing is right or wrong in the context of GT as a whole.

Really delighted to hear that. This is what I wanted to. Because of this I
tried my hands on GTWGM. Please do so. Till then I stop any development on
this GT. I am pretty sure the solution you will come up with will be more

Hi Pritpal,

I'd like to add non-GNU and GNU makefiles for what32,
but there are some collisions here, which need to be
fixed:

errorsys.prg
debug.prg

There is also an uppercase extension to be fixed:

wininet.CH -> wininet.ch

Could you pls correct these?

Brgds,
Viktor

Returning to my "obsession" once again ;-).

Just a quick reminder that newsgroup does
not suffer from such a problem at all :).

A mail<->newsgroup gateway (Gmane ?) would
be at least a "partial" soultion if a group
does not like to move to newsgroup only.

I cannot investigate without make files, unfortunately.

It won't show you any warnings, the problem is the same
as with gtwvg, the core build process will create debug.obj
(from /source/vm/debug.c) and errorsys.obj (from /source/rtl/ 
errorsys.prg)
in /obj/b32/ and later on the what32 build process won't
compile these local files, because the .obj is already there.
So basically the wrong (core) .objs will be included in the
what32.lib.

You simply have to remove them all, commit, and readd
them with the proper filename.

roughly:
1. copy files to have a backup
2. svn remove --force <filename>
3. svn commit
4. copy files back, rename them to be lowercase and to avoid collisions
5. svn add <filename>
6. svn commit

Viktor

I personally don't like newsgroups for this purpose,
not to mention that it would need a separate client
to (buy,) setup and use (and to search, backup, migrate).

Since I've never missed a single message from
this list, and I'm using gmail, I can recommend
creating a gmail account for this purpose only
and setup forwarding on the gmail account to the final
e-mail account (it filters SPAM very efficiently
too).

[ The only slight drawback of gmail is that I'm still
not receiving back any of my e-mails sent to the list,
but this is quite easy to workaround locally, so
it's only a problem for my CHANGELOGs, since I'm
sending those through blat + stunnel, from a different
machine. This actually seems to be a feature of gmail,
where it filters out any incoming messages which
have a ID already existing under the e-mail account;
so for example, you won't receive back an e-mail you've
sent to yourself either. ]

An optional NG interface to this mailing list would
also be handy, but it should either be read-only
(which would not give much more compared to the web-
interface), or authentication must be properly solved.

Brgds,
Viktor

? buy ? You must be kidding. Either Outlook or Thunderbird
has it embedded. Not to mention  http://www.nntp.hk/web
web interface too. And AFAIK Thunderbird is multiplatform.

This is totaly unacceptable to me since I often delete
sent messages. Not to mention that GMAIL is not something
I'd like to use. Just a personal preference.

Don't forget that it's *only* your opinion regarding
"read only" access. Others can have different one.

But in case of Gmane :

"Articles posted to Gmane newsgroups are forwarded to
their respective mailing lists after the user has gotten
a per-group authorization."

I didn't explore which is the best NG reader on OSX (since
I'm only using NGs through Google Groups search), but even
if free, the rest of the issues need to be dealt with.

Well, it was just one possible solution to this problem,
which I know is working. There are probably other dozens
of free (and non-free) e-mail providers which could be used
with similar (or even more) success. One of them may be
the e-mail address provided by sourceforge.net, which
many of us already have.

Disclaimer: I cannot care less who's using which e-mail
provider.

Phil, do you have an idea (or bump, log messages), why
some e-mails are not getting delivered.

Przemek, if you could send one example of e-mail not
delivered to you, maybe it would also help.

Did I say it's others' optinion somewhere?

(I fact I begun my message with "I personally")

> "Articles posted to Gmane newsgroups are forwarded to

I'd personally (and IMO) surely not want to get e-mails
from this list from non-subscribed addresses. This is the
developer's list, so I think it's better this way in order
to keep the noise and distraction down.

A _user's_ list is a different matter, could be a newsgroup,
blog, mailing list, forum, whatever users and participating
developers want to use. I this case a fully open solution
is indeed much better (IMO).

Brgds,
Viktor

Some of these warnings should be eliminated in similar 
way they are eliminated in harbour/make_vc.bat - by using 
HB_VISUALC_VER envvar. 

BTW, it would be good to synchronize CFLAGS used in 
harbour/contrib/make_vc.bat with those used in 
harbour/make_vc.bat. The same is true for Bcc.

now make_b32.bat works.

A problem still remains in contribs: missing dot give error.
a line like this
    @$(ECHO) if "%1" == "" goto SKIP     >> _hbdeloo.bat
has to be write as (note dots):
    @$(ECHO) if "%1". == "". goto SKIP     >> _hbdeloo.bat

because without dots when the file is wrote you will have:
    if %1 ==  goto SKIP
that is wrong

Thank you

Francesco,

What is your environment? I wonder because here for example
the quotes are properly replicated in the .bat here. (BCC55 + XP)

BTW, maybe a better fix would be this?:
   @$(ECHO) if %1. == . goto SKIP     >> _hbdeloo.bat

(since the quotes have the exact same purpose as the dots.

Brgds,
Viktor

The only resonable fix to this problem I can think of is to 
use your version of the above command (modified a little) :

  @$(ECHO) if %1x == x goto SKIP     >> _hbdeloo.bat

Mine is XPSP2 + BCC, but if now I remove dots as described above, these are 
generated files:

_hbdeloa.bat
-------
@call _hbdeloo.bat ..\..\obj\b32\adordd
@call _hbdeloo.bat
-------

_hbdeloo.bat
-------
@echo off
if %1 ==  goto SKIP
if exist %1.c del %1.c
if exist %1.obj del %1.obj
:SKIP
-------

As I thought, not tested here, "" are removed from make program, not cmd.

Best Regards

Francesco

I every use dots as marker in batch file, but every char is usefull.
Is there a reason for preferring a different char to dot, or it is only for 
readability ?

to Victor,
I have checked my make.exe file and is from borland version 5.2

Readability.

AFAIK "x" was the "common delimiter" for such tasks :)

Thanks Francesco, I'm puzzled why this same setup
won't give me the same results. It would be good
to know the difference for the future.

(I've tried running make from cmd.exe, and my
quotes are still there)

Can't it be, you have an echo.exe (or .com/.bat)
in your path?

Can you try with:
set ECHO=echo.

Before calling our make batches?

Brgds,
Viktor

May be safer than dot, since who knows which
tool will consider the dot as special char and
do some tricks with it.

with echo. it works.
Googling and looking at windows help file I have found that echo. (with dot) 
it is used to show an empty line (from help guide), but other parts said 
that it adds a CRLF to the string.
IMHO with and without dot cmd works differently because it changes 
behaviour.
I have every used with dot, also if not empty.

apart from this after:
2007-11-26 14:36 UTC+0100 Viktor Szakats (harbour.01 syenar.hu)

now it works

Thank you

'echo.' is the same as 'echo' in all DOS/Windows operating
systems (I know of). There are (at least) two advantages of
'echo.' compared to 'echo':

1. 'echo.' will always be executed by the command shell
    as an internal command. So if you have 'echo.exe'
    (or similar) in your path, it will not interfere
    with the command.
2. 'echo.' without any parameter will output a CRLF,
    as opposed to 'echo' which shows the current echo state.
    As you say.

I've just had a chance to test 'echo.' under W2K3
and for it seems to work well (tried it from cmd.exe
only though).

There is no difference in the way 'echo' and 'echo.'
parameters are processed by the command shell. You should
get the exact same output.

> now it works

If 'echo.' works and 'echo' doesn't, it's a sign that
you might have an application named 'echo' in your path.
Problem with this, is that we cannot make any assumption
on such an external echo command, and we cannot guarantee
that next time something else will not work as expected.

Under XP, if I type 'echo.exe' in the command line, it
will show 'exe' on the screen, but if I use this same
command in the make file, it will actually try to launch
echo.exe. It seem it depends on the way the external
command is launched internally.

So I'd suggest to delete or rename this command.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Viktor, Paul, all,

I have to say I get "crazy" with this "echo"/"echo."
behavior on my system (Win2003). Today "echo." works
without problems :). Exactly as "echo". The problem
is : *I did not change anything in my configuration* !
Pure DOS window and a batch to set path to Bcc.
Previously, it did not ( you know that :) ).

I do not know what to say ...

Got it !
Damn, I have also an echo.exe in gnuwin32 (linux tools porting for windows) 
path.
Renamed.
Now I will try it, but surely now it has to work.
Sorry for your time.

About echo. under Win2003 I use it every day on various servers and it works 
without any problem.

Thank you

I've actually removed HB_CC_NAME on purpose to avoid
dependency on this external variable, and.. see below:

IMO, this way you can accidentally create the binaries
in the wrong place. I don't think we should making it
a user option to place the build binaries in custom places
inside the Harbour source tree.

Why is it useful for a Harbour user or developer to
customize it?

If anything, it should be $(_HB_CC_NAME), not $(HB_CC_NAME),
because the former is the var which will get the default value
in mtpl*.bat

Brgds,
Viktor

You are wrong. We do NOT allow to place binaries anywhere
inside the Harbour source tree. We ONLY allow them to place
binaries inside (potentialy their) folders in bin,lib and
obj dirs. Check makefiles yourself.

> Why is it useful for a Harbour user or developer to

I've already explained why in one of my ealier posts few
days ago.

Just a general remark - It doesn't hurt at all. It doesn't
seem to be dangerous, at least not more dangerous than any
other envvar. It gives freedom for end users to create
binaries under folders of their own names - not necesarily
those preffered by developers. It's an elegant solution.

Just a personal remark - I need it.

> If anything, it should be $(_HB_CC_NAME), not $(HB_CC_NAME),

Actually there is *absolutly* no reason to use underscore
as a prefix to _HB_CC_NAME, _HB_MAKE_PROGRAM and _HB_SHOW_ERRORS.
It only makes unnecesary confusion in comparison to "main"
makefiles form harbour dir. It is something to fix ASAP.

Marek, please don't undo my work done here.

Especially if we're taling about a feature you only need or use.

Thanks.

Did you even try this (I did, before I wrote my message) ?
Please do ... and then write here about your results ...

It seems you are taking it personaly. I really do not
know why. If something is NOT your work then you usualy
have your opinion and you are forcing your POV (vide
redundancy in makefiles in contrib dir), but if it is
your work then you try to block any activity, raising
"strange" arguments, even if the situation is obvious
to fix. I don't think this is a good aproach.

Hi Marek,

Would you be so kind to turn off TABs in your editor
please?

I've spend quite some time cleaning them, and after
your recent commits, they're there again.

TABs are only allowed in GNU makefiles inside Harbour.

Viktor

Marek, if someone is using standard .bat file, this
extra flexibility is not needed _at all_, as the value
is ALWAYS "b32" for mtpl_b32.mak and ALWAYS "vc" for
mtpl_vc.bat, otherwise the whole setup won't work.
You can however set HB_CC_NAME to "vc" and launch
make_b32.bat, which I don't clearly see why is useful.
On that same ground you could simply call make_%CC_NAME%.bat
from your own local batch file and call it a day.

So, I'm talking about the possibility when someone is
noticing this unneeded flexibility, and starts to use it,
directly, not through the batch files. It can only cause
trouble. I just don't see why this variable is there. I
used this as an internal helper var to create more common
line between the B32/VC build systems, to more easily spot
the unwanted differences.

But anyway, I don't care, I just don't understand your
motives this time at all.

Let me remind you that before I raised this whole issue,
we had a _ton_ of completely different VC/B32 make, batch
files laying around the contrib tree, for most of its
part missing or not working (especially VC). With your
valuable help and also me spending probably way too much
time on this, now we have all core logic in _4_ files,
surrounded by fully identical standard files in special case
(solely for a new feature: lib .lib generation from .dll,
however imperfect it is), and plain _one-liner_ batch
files, and dead simple, non-redundant local non-GNU make
files with working install/clean support including headers.
And these latter files are the only ones to be modified in
real life, meaning: no syncing is required in everyday operations.

Few month back, no one could possibly go into any contrib
and type make_*.bat and have a working lib ready to use.

I honestly don't see where did I make a mistake in this picture.

What I take badly indeed is when I don't know what is happening
and why in the repository especially when it comes to
stuff we've discussed together and I've spent long nights
implementing. Apart from this one personal thing, I prefer
to have stuff in the repo which everyone will benefit from,
this is why I don't understand this completely unnecessary
move, and your reaction to this: we should then "fix" all .bat
files. Why?

The reason I wanted to hear about your strange (for me) usage
of our new contrib make system is to understand what you want to
achieve here, so maybe we could find a generic solution to it,
and everyone would benefit.

Brgds,
Viktor

Until you created unnecesary dependency between batfiles
and makefiles introducing

    set HB_MAKEFILE=make_%HB_CC_NAME%.mak
and
    set HB_MAKEFILE=..\mtpl_%HB_CC_NAME%.mak

it worked PERFECTLY using standard batfiles/makefiles.
You could set CC_DIRNAME to any value and it worked.
Now there is a need to do tricks to achieve the same.

Sorry Viktor, I am not going to repeat myself. I answered
you few days ago.

Exactly the same can be said about HB_BIN_INSTALL and the
rest. Will you call it "unneeded flexibility" ?

??? What are you talking about Viktor ?

_HB_CC_NAME, _HB_MAKE_PROGRAM and _HB_SHOW_ERRORS are used
*only* in mtpl_b32.bat and mtpl_vc.bat. What "all bat files"
are you talking about ?

Viktor, *this is a generic* solution. There is *no* need
to "find" any other.

Why are we keeping this ugly, unneccesary *hack*
which serves for no purposes ? It is not needed
anymore.

Now we have :
     set _HB_CC_NAME=%HB_CC_NAME%
     set _HB_MAKE_PROGRAM=%HB_MAKE_PROGRAM%
     set _HB_SHOW_ERRORS=%HB_SHOW_ERRORS%

     if "%_HB_CC_NAME%"      == "" set _HB_CC_NAME=b32
     if "%_HB_MAKE_PROGRAM%" == "" set _HB_MAKE_PROGRAM=make.exe
     if "%_HB_SHOW_ERRORS%"  == "" set _HB_SHOW_ERRORS=yes

After the fix we could simply have :
     if "%HB_CC_NAME%"      == "" set HB_CC_NAME=b32
     if "%HB_MAKE_PROGRAM%" == "" set HB_MAKE_PROGRAM=make.exe
     if "%HB_SHOW_ERRORS%"  == "" set HB_SHOW_ERRORS=yes

Please note that _HB_CC_NAME, _HB_MAKE_PROGRAM and
_HB_SHOW_ERRORS are completly useless ...

Well, if you ask me, I'd change this to this one:

--
set HB_CC_NAME=b32
set HB_MAKE_PROGRAM=make.exe
--

But, since you need us to support ovverride of these
internal vars, we need to deal with this simple case:

call make_b32 adordd
call make_vc adordd

Which, if we implement your proposal, would instantly break.

However, how about this solution:

--- mtpl_*.bat
set HB_CC_NAME=b32
set HB_MAKE_PROGRAM=make.exe
--- mtpl_*.mak
-> Replace _HB_CC_NAME with HB_CC_DIR which would default to  
HB_CC_NAME, if not specified.

?

I have a concern about this change.

The mainstay of GTWGM ( Multi-console Terminal ) I am working on is based on
screen-buffer for each console. How that will fit into this scenario? I am
sure you must be having other idea to achieve it in core code, which I too
wish, but right now I am unable to understand your plans in that directions.

Can you please guide me how it can be achieved for multi-windows ? I will be
happy if you publish a white paper on this subject.

Pritpal Bedi, INDIA-USA

BTW did you go through the protocol of GTWGM. I need your support in that
direction.

Subject: [Harbour] TBrowse.prg - Needed an Instance Variable
Message-ID: <13962532.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello Victor

As I have learnt, you are currently working on Tbrowse. 

I need an public instance variable <aColumnsSep> a numeric array of column
positions where visible columns intersect to paint graphic lines in a
browser vertically. In xHarbour I added this code 

METHOD RedrawHeaders( nWidth ) CLASS TBrowse
   //.......
   //..........

   nSpacePre := INT( ( nWidth - ::nColsWidth ) / 2 )
   nSpaceLast := nWidth - nSpacePre - ::nColsWidth

   nCol := ::nwLeft + iif( ::nFrozenCols > 0, 0, nSpacePre )

   nColFrom := iif( ::nFrozenCols > 0, 1, ::leftVisible )

   ::aColumnsSep := {}

   for n := nColFrom to ::rightVisible
      ::aColsInfo[ n, TBCI_SCRCOLPOS ] := nCol

      nCol += ::aColsInfo[ n, TBCI_WIDTH ]

      if n < ::rightVisible
         if ::aColsInfo[ n,TBCI_WIDTH ] > 0
            aadd( ::aColumnsSep, nCol + int( ::aColsInfo[ n + 1,
TBCI_SEPWIDTH ] / 2 ) )
            nCol += ::aColsInfo[ n + 1, TBCI_SEPWIDTH ]
         endif
      endif

      if ::nFrozenCols > 0 .and. n == ::nFrozenCols
         n    := ::leftVisible - 1
         nCol += nSpacePre
      endif
   next
   ......
   ......
Return self

As it will take me a while to incorporate this in Harbour Tbrowse, is it
possible that you do so.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Pritpal,

I'm not in favour of any such class extensions of C5.x classes.
In fact all such extensions (there weren't too many, and none
which would have been widely used, or used at all) have just
been disabled for the default build.

So I'd propose to solve this along these lines:

1) Let's try to find a solution which doesn't need
    such class extension. Would be useful to see the
    code you need this for. Worst case you can
    re-implement whole TB class with your preferred
    extensions in your own code (maybe even by using
    xhb TB implementation). Advantage of open source.
    xhb TBrowse could maybe even added xhb lib.
2) If this seems impossible, and adding an extension
    is inevitable, we'd need to offer a feature which is
    clean and useful for _most_ users. I'd propose
    to minimize logic inside TB code, and publish only
    the most basic and necessary information through
    a METHOD which is needed for your code to calculate the
    placement of the column separators. Notice that your code
    specifically returns the center of the column separator,
    which is not a value actually used inside TB at all.
3) If in Harbour, this feature will have to guarded with
    HB_EXTENSION. (Until we find a way to control or even add
    such class extensions from user code. .NET 3.5 added
    such a class extension feature, but I forgot the name.)

Brgds,
Viktor

Come on ... stop using such silly arguments ...
It has no sense. It's *me* who showed you that 
you have broken contrib builds changing 
%COMSPEC% /c to "call". And I had to write at
least few private mails explaining you why until
you got it.

> However, how about this solution:

It doesn't make sense at all. It is simplier to
direcly use "b32" and "make.exe" in such a case -
which forces end users to do things in a way
"Viktor graciously allows them to do".

Anyway, I am not interested in further arguing with you.

You have no arguments, you write things you didn't even
checked or verified, you force silly solutions just to
have the final word. 
Clearly speaking, I don't care. Do what you want to do.

<-------------------------->

To have your own Tbrowse in your code is never a solution, though for me
personally it is not a problem. This extension will not be used by me alone;
it is needed part of GUI elements of GTWVG. This extension is neither heavy
not interferes with Clipper compatibility. Developer will never be aware of
this extension as it does not have any meaning to them and it never have to
be documented. Only Wvt*Classes() library will be accessing it. In xHarbour
it is guarded against HB_EXTENSION and we can implement it like the same.

So your 3rd option is what I thought of and fulfills both goals.

BTW attached is the pure Harbour usable debugged xHarbour Tbrowse+Tbcolumn
sources which do not require xhb.lib or compatibility issues, in case you
intend to review it:

It's not a proper extension, since it's custom built for
this purpose _only_, and not very useful for any other purpose
IMO.

3rd was a step not an option alone, we should also consider
doing the 2nd point and do it properly. I'd suggest creating
extension functions to extract the position and width of
any column, with the help of these two information, you can
calculate the positioning of the separator line. But in any
case your code has to deal with the situation when HB_EXTENSION
is off.

This is a known issue, see the reply Przemek wrote to me on this
subject on 2007-05-17:
http://lists.harbour-project.org/pipermail/harbour/2007-May/001761.html

I think this is an important compatibility issue, there are many
Clipper users (me included) who use the @clp option instead of
separate obj for each module.

added a check for HB_WINCE for using "FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE" 

  #if defined(HB_WINCE)   
      fExist = ( dwAttr != INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES ) &&
               ( dwAttr & ( FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY |
                            FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE ) ) == 0;

      fExist = ( dwAttr != INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES ) &&

  #endif

Now it compile ok with MSVC.

Please look at include/hbwince.h
If FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE macro is not defined in this file
then remove it from #ifndef MAX_COMPUTERNAME_LENGTH / #endif
statement and add separate definition:
   #ifndef FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE
      #define FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE           0x00000040
   #endif

I'd like to keep all WINCE definitions in one place - different
C compilers uses different definitions in their header files and
it should help updating them.

Hi Przemek,


I'm not sure to understand what you mean.

Would you like I add the sentence 
   #ifndef FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE
      #define FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE           0x00000040
   #endif
 Within file hbfsapi.c in place of testing HB_WINCE ?

JF

Seems that I missed what you exactly done when I've seen
HB_WINCE and "Now it compile ok with MSVC". My fault sorry.

I though you added workaround for missing in MSVC for WinCE
FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE definition. But it looks that this
definition is also missed in you MSVC for Win32. In summary
we have in hbwince.h:
    #define FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE 0x00000040
because such definition was not present in newest MSVC for
pocket PC and then you added in hbfsapi.c workaround also
for Win32.

So we do not need
    #if defined(HB_WINCE)
in hbfsapi.c but
    #if !defined(_MSC_VER)
or better:
    #if defined( FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY )

But before we begin to make next modifications maybe we
should check why new MSVC stops to support this define.
Is it a bug or MS plans to eliminate it?
If it's MSVC bug then:
    #ifndef FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE
       #define FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE           0x00000040
    #endif
at the beginning of hbfsapi.c seems to be the best solution and
I'll remove this definition from hbwince.h.

Hi,


but it will return wrong value for Windows (not CE). HB_FileExist() will 
return .T. if file does not exist, but device exists.
I suggest to change to:

#if defined(__MSVC__)
        fExist = ( dwAttr != INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES ) &&
                 ( dwAttr & ( FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY ) ) == 0;
#else
        fExist = ( dwAttr != INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES ) &&
                 ( dwAttr & ( FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY |
                              FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE ) ) == 0;
#endif

or add:

#ifndef FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE
    #define FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE           0x00000040
#endif

if MSVC is missing this definition. But I'm surprised, why MicroSoft 
misses definition of it's constant?

Why not Harbour for NET ?  It certainly "looks
better" on Harbour's developer list  ;-)

Unfortunately, we lack highly experienced NET developers
interested enough to build Harbour for NET :(.

I investigated the "problem" a little and it seems that
actualy, DLR ("Dynamic Language Runtime" NET layer to
support dynamic languages from Microsoft) is IMO capable
enough to write the "core" of Harbour (a compiler and an
equivalent of clasical Harbour's VM). Everything seems to
be in place : support for codeblocks, closures, macro
compilation, symbols table, ready to use AST, etc. ...
I guess the problem would be with GT and RDD subsystems,
but these could be done as a set of wrappers around
"unmanaged" code taken from current Harbour at first
step.

But, as you can see from the second paragraph, "all
these above" are only "theoretical speculations" :(.

You shouldn't expect Harbour for NET in a near, and
not so near future at all.

Hello, 


it seems, everyone is interested in CUI/GUI/WWW with the same source. 
It's a problem that makes me still thing about it, when I go to 
sleep, 
for the last half of the year. I a spear time I try to write some 
AJAX/PHP code to implement a browser widget via WWW. 


I've done some remote GUI terminal tests last December, and I've post 
a 
letter to xharbour developers mailing list  (the letter is cited in 
the 
end of this message). But I want to my terminal to by multiplatform, 
so 
I've started a similar work on implementing GTK+ calls via TCP. I've 
also found a similar inactive project: http://ntw.sourceforge.net/

Do you think about a specific existing multiplatform GUI like 
wxWidgets 
or GTK? Or are you talking about implementation of our own GUI? (I 
found 
GTK the most useful in this case).

I see a difficulty here if some widgets library is used. Because GUI 
application can have a few opened modal dialogs. Application's CPU 
stack 
is executing (recursively) a several message processing loops. How 
can 
such application state be restored after reconnection from another 
terminal? 
Of cause, it can be done if the whole windows managers is implemented 
on 
the server side and only GUI image is send over the network. But 
implementation of windows managers itself is a big job and network 
traffic for "server side GUI" application is much bigger, than for 
client side widgets.

Perhaps you needs are different, but in my case, I do not need a 
Harbour 
application on web site hosted by another company. In many cases I 
need 
a possibility to install a Linux computer and use it as database 
application server for my customers. The other workstations usually 
are 
WinXP. A remote GUI terminals or WWW terminals is the thing I need!

I thing implementation of HVM in PHP or another vitual machine will 
be 
very slow. The only possible solution is not to implement the HVM 
itself, but try to convert HVM PCode to ex., PHP PCode, and pass 
converted PCode to PHP VM. 


> Do you plan to design professional looking GUI apps using "hand coded"

I do not know if Przemek uses any "mouse designer", but after I've 
tried 
  "hand coded" and "visually designed" coding style, I've understood 
I'm 
a programmer but not designer. 
Of cause if you need to think about coordinates @ ..., ... for every 
widget, I can not make a good widget layout. But this fixed 
coordinates 
approach is not very good. In different OS the same widget (ex., 
RadioButton) can have a different dimension, so fixed coordinates is 
not 
good as well as mouse designed dialogs. I prefer layout widgets to do 
dialog. Currently (well, already for 7 years...) in our company, we 
use 
a pretty crazy(!) 3 letter description for position of any widget 
(letters corresponds to something like: LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, BOTTOM, 
CENTER, VCENTER, etc...). All dialogs are "hand coded" and widgets' 
positions are calculated using its layout descriptions.

=================== Attachment: docs.txt ==================== 


History 
======= 
     After I've found Clip-4-Win product I've understood that Clipper 
application can perfectly run on Windows OS. Memory management, 
startup 
and a few other functions should be rewritten. Our company was able to 
buy Clip-4-Win, but we had bad experienced with other product (we 
send self contained bug samples to Successware for 5 or more times, 
but SIX3 bugs were not fixed). So, we decided to write memory 
management functions ourselves. I've started to analyse internals of 
Clipper in early 1996. After half a year we had a working "Hello, 
World" under Win16 and Clipper. After implementetion of WinAPI wrapper 
functions and creation of some GUI control objects like browse, we 
had first Win16 database application in 1997. We call our library 
CAWI (Clipper Application Windows Interface). 
     Later we rewrote wrapper functions and GUI objects under Win32 
and 
now we are successfully using CAWI32 to write true Win32 GUI xHarbour 
applications. 


Problems 
======== 
     We are very satisfied with our current "programming enviroment", 
but we have to problems: 


1) Windows file sharing is not very suitable for database 
applications. 
We use Advantage Database Server to avoid index corruption, but ADS 
seems to expensive for smaller customers; 


2) customer are also seeking for terminal solutions. Quite often the 
subdivisions of a company are in a few cities, but they want to share 
the same database. They are forced to buy microsoft terminal server 
licences and use internet connection. 


     The alternative for ADS could be NETRDD. More complex (requires 
some rewrite of application) solution for both of problems could be a 
Linux server with locally running server application and remote GUI 
terminal. I do not know exactly what is in Przemyslaw's head, but 
probabily he call this GTNET. 


     I want to share and discuss the ideas about remote GUI terminal 
implementation. I know I can implement it alone in a year, but my 
implementation will be not multiplatform, a little bit adapted to 
the needs of our company, a little bit hacky and it will be not the 
thing I can upload to CVS (just like my CAWI32 library now). 


Ideas 
===== 
   - Server code depends only on socket functions, so it is easy to 
make 
     it multiplatform. Terminal part could be implemented on native 
GUI 
     on Win32 and using GTK on Linux. This will make terminal part to 
be 
     multiplatform. So, we need two terminal applications, but 
terminal 
     application is universal (except you want to implement new 
     controls/widgets). 


   - Control layout. People in our company were to lazy to work with 
     dialog form designers and do not like "visual programming" 
approach 
     very much. So, we implemented a layout management in our CAWI 
     library. This is a great thing! It allows dialog to be resized! 
     This should be implemented. 


   - I suggest using UTF8 for server code and network transfer. 


   - Control, browse, column, menu ids should be string typed. This 
will 
     help to avoid meaningless constants and defines. Hash can easy do 
     all nessesary job. 


   - Code should be executed on one side: server or client! Otherwise 
     inconsistent server/client state could appear. Ex., server sent 
     a command to destroy dialog, but client at the same time sent 
     notification command which should open a new child for this 
dialog. 
     So, all network I/O could be done in synchronous way. 


   - The number of commands (methods) which requires an answer from 
     remote site should be minimal! 
     Ex., the typical place to create dialog's child controls is 
     WM_CREATE message in dialog callback function. So, after 
     CreateWindow() return, all childs controls are already created. 
     This technique is slow in network enviroment since we must 
     forward WM_CREATE back to server and return after controls are 
     created: 


         Server side                     Terminal side 
         =====================           ====================== 
         CreateWindow (dialog)  ---->    CreateWindow() 
                                         | 
         WM_CREATE              <----    WM_CREATE 
         | 
         CreateWindow (child)   ---->    CreateWindow() 
                                         | 
         hwndChild              <----    return from CreateWindow() 
         | 
         return from WM_CREATE  ----> 
                                         | 
         hwndDialog             <----    return from CreateWindow() 
         | 


     In this case we have triple network round-trip time, for creation 
     of such dialog. This would noticable even in LAN, if the number 
of 
     controls is large. 


     If we create child controls after return from CreateWindow 
     (WM_CREATE is empty or processed on terminal side) we reduce 
     creation time. To avoid blinking of the created dialog and 
control 
     we need to create dialog invisible and show it after control 
     creation. 


         CreateWindow (dialog)  ---->    CreateWindow() 
                                         | 
         hwndDialog             <----    return from CreateWindow() 
         | 
         CreateWindow (child)   ---->    CreateWindow() 
                                         | 
         hwndChild              <----    return from CreateWindow() 
         | 
         ShowWindow   (dialog)  ---->    ShowWindow() 
         | 


     If we can omit ShowWindow() result we reduce creation time to 
     double network round-trip time. 


     The return value of CreateWindow() is window handle hwnd, which 
     is used to identify window in the following function calls. If 
     we use some other object/window identification method we can 
     drop CreateWindow() response packet. Solution could be the 
     following: unique ids are sent from server side and after 
creation 
     of window, the obtained hwnd is bound to the id. 


         CreateWindow id1 (dialog)   ---->  CreateWindow(), 
         |                                  |  hwndDialog <-> id1 
         CreateWindow id2 (child)    ---->  CreateWindow(), 
         |                                  |  hwndChild <-> id2 
         ShowWindow id1              ---->  ShowWindow( hwndDialog ) 
         | 


     Using this approach, dialog creation time does not have network 
     round-trip time component at all. Server sends commands and 
     terminal creates controls in parallel. 


   - Usualy window generates a huge number of notification messages, 
ex., 
     mouse move over window. Most of them should be processed on 
terminal 
     side and only registered messages should be sent to server. For 
ex., 
     if we have checkbox in a dialog and we want to enable/disable 
other 
     dialog controls if this checkbox is clicked, we need to register 
     "onclick" message for this checkbox and do required enable/ 
disable 
     operations on "onclick" notification message. If message is not 
     registered, notification messages will not be sent to the server 
and 
     other control will be independent from the state of checkbox. 


     It is possible to implement macro or even PCode transfer from 
server 
     to terminal and process some notification messages locally and 
this 
     way even more reduce required network traffic. 


Problems to solve 
================= 
   - How objects are identified in communication protocol? Is current 
     :nTID ok? 


   - If object is destroyed (no more references) on terminal, do we 
     need to destroy it on server? Vice-versa? 


   - Howto stream method/function call to the network? What protocol 
to 
     use? How to call method with variable number of parameters? 
       hb_vmPushSymbol( method ) 
       hb_vmPush( pitemObject ) 
       hb_vmPush( pitemParam1 ) 
       ... 
       hb_vmPush( pitemParamN ) 
       hb_vmSend( N ) 
     How to hold method symbols? Can we use method names? How slow is 
     resolving symbol from name? 


   - Can objects be created on terminal (ex., some terminal 
extensions, 
     terminal side dialogs)? Do they have its ids (:TID)? Can these 
     controls send notification messages to server? Can method of 
these 
     objects be called by server code? 


   - Class hierarchy 


   - In gtk, widgets are created without parent and later are added to 
     container and get parent this way. In Windows, it is required to 
     have handle of parent during widget creation process. Windows 
does 
     not create widgets if parent is NULL. 
     The other difference is that layout is not a real widget's parent 
     in Windows, the real parent is dialog. 
     I've tried to do workaround. I've created widgets with dummy 
     (existing, but hidden) parent, and when widget is added to 
layout, 
     I change widget's parent to the dialog which owns layout (using 
     SetParent()). 
     From the first look it was a nice solution. The only limitation 
is 
     that the layout should be added to dialog before widget is added 
to 
     the layout. But this could be documented. 
     But later I found a problem, SetParent() puts widget into the 
front 
     of child widgets list (but not to the end of the list like in 
     normal widget creation process). So, TAB key actives such widgets 
     in reversed order. 
     It seems, the better solution in this situation is lazy widget 
     creation. Widgets should be created after widget objects are 
added 
     to the layout and dialog is to be displayed. 


   - The selection of activate widget using TAB key is also 
implemented 
     in very strange way in windows. 
     Application architecture is message oriented, but implementation 
of 
     TAB key in dialog boxes requires to alter main message processing 
     loop. The function IsDialogMessage() should be added to this 
loop. 
     This function processes keyboard and some other messages to 
     implement TAB key function (and some other functions) for the 
     dialog box. The main problem is that handle of active dialog 
should 
     be passed to this function. 
     It is not a problem if we have modal dialog, it has its own 
message 
     processing loop with IsDialogMessage() call. But if we have 
     modeless dialog, we must pass handle of active dialog to the main 
     message processing loop which is very independent code from the 
     dialog itself. We must use some static variables, etc., to pass 
this 
     handle. The problem is more difficult if we have several modeless 
     dialogs, or the want to place widgets inside MDI childs and have 
TAB 
     key functionality. We must pass handle of active dialog to 
     IsDialogMessage(), i.e., we must change the static handle 
variable 
     on each window activation/deactivation. 
     I'm not familiar how this is implemented in other OS. 


Sample application 
================== 
   - I've put source.zip and demo executables (Win32) on the web at 
     http://www.dbtopas.lt/hrb 
     You can download it, if you are interested in. 


   - Files: 
     source.zip 
         Contains demo source code. File rapp.prg is terminal 
application 
         server. Such code should be writen by application 
programmers. 
         The rest of code (rterm.prg and src\ files) are to be written 
by 
         remote terminal library developers. 
         Code is not fully self contained. The source of WinAPI 
wrapper 
         library (CAWI32) is missing, but you can understand what 
function 
         do, by name of the function. Win32 API references is also 
         available on the web. Server (application) code is almost 
         multiplatform. The only depend on socket api. Perhaps, 
dropping 
         WSAStartup() and WSACleanup() calls is the only change needed 
to 
         run it on Linux. 


     rtapp.exe [ <ip_port> ] 
         Default <ip_port> is 9215 


     rterm.exe [ tcp://<host>:<port> ] 
         Default parameter is tcp://localhost:9215

Hello 

<--------------------------->
it seems, everyone is interested in CUI/GUI/WWW with the same source. 
<--------------------------->

In the context of remote terminal, here is my humble development preview.

The Server application is an xHarbour/GTWVT.
The Clients are in Harbour( MinGW ) for Windows and (MinGW-CE) for PDA/Cell
Phones.
The Server is xHarbour/MT application.

It is a 3-way architect.

I post here only the client executables. Just run it and it will connect to
my Server appln.

Steps:
1) Select <Select Organization>
2) Select <Vouch Terminal Server Inc>
3) Enter User/Pass : u0001/u0001  through  u0050/u0050 ( in case someone is
already in )
4) Enter on current date
5) Traverse the menues
6) Select <Accounts/Vouchers>
7) <Add> a record - Please do so and post your your name in the narration,
:--)))
8) Do whatever you wish.
9) The default selection key for account numbers is SH+F6.

Note for PDA client, there is no ESC key there so please use the PDA
keyboard emulator.

There is some data already on the server, so please feel free to play.
Please note that my server is a small machine connected remotely to the
router, so remain patient if you notice some delays.

http://www.nabble.com/file/p13984527/VClientMGW.exe VClientMGW.exe 
http://www.nabble.com/file/p13984527/VClientPDA.exe VClientPDA.exe 

This is a pure terminal client. GTWVG is scheduled to be incorporated
shortly.

I am looking towards Przem's remarks on GTNET, and to me it appears to be a
reality.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi, INDIA-USA

Massimo,
<Br-Pt> No seu pa?s existe uma Empresa que desenvolve ferramenta CASE para xBase. ? uma excelente ferramenta chamada dBSee. Eu acho que eles t?m capacidade de adaptar o dBSee para gerar c?digo Console/GUI/WEB. Por qu? n?o contacta e tenta convencer? O endere?o ? este: www.visualdbsee.com
 
<Bad Eng> In your country exist a Company CASE developer for xBase. It is exceletn tool chamada dBSee. I think they has capacity to adapt dBSee to generate code for Console/GUI/WEB. Why do you contact and try convencer? The web site is this: www.visualdbsee.com.

I'm confused, what really means HB_OS_WIN_32_USED?

Can't pgsql be used under Linux?

I think it is used by the Win32 branch to include windows.h
The flag is used when the Win API is used in a given sourse.

Hi Lorenzo,

It's the #define which tells Harbour to automatically
include windows.h, _if_ compiled for Windows.

It doesn't lessen portability or means that a given source
file can compile under any other operating systems without
modifications. I don't specificly know about pgSQL, but
chances are high Linux is supported (but even if not, it's not
caused by this define).

[ Note: This is a hack really, and the reason for it is that
unfortunately Harbour has some #defines which collide with windows.h,
if not included in certain way. The "right" fix was shortly discussed
a few weeks ago between Przemek and me, problem is: it causes  
incompatibility
and seems a lot of work to do. Also notice that CA-Cl*pper compatible
C level defines _do_ collide with windows.h, so this is also something
to solve. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

I haven't check all of them but probably yes.
We can also add small trick to make files and use wildcard function
to detect directory name, f.e. we can test: contrib/$(lib) then if it
does not exist contrib/hb$(lib), contrib/lib$(lib), contrib/$(lib:hb%=%)
and finally contrib/$(lib:lib%=%) anyhow it's still hack which in some
cases may be source of other problems.

Adding 'hb' prefix to library name may resolve some possible
name space problems but if we will start to make it in contrib
code then why we should not change also core libraries?

if we decide to add hb prefix to all libraries then we may use
directory names without this prefix and change make files to look
for contrib/$(lib:hb%=%)

Hi Mindaugas, (Hi Przemek)

You (Mindaugas) wrote ;

"if MSVC is missing this definition. But I'm surprised, why MicroSoft

Simple ... this is because I use an old compiler (V. 12.00.8168).

Maybe I could write

We can also decide (x)Harbour can only be compiled with recent compiler, but not sure it's a good idea. ;-)

Last but not least, I can simply patch my WinNt.h file to include this definition and write a note there to warn people about this needed patch if using old msvc version.

What do you think ?

this is a mix of the Viktor K.'s pdflib ( that can be found at

and the hbdoc's pdf output. I think the hbdoc should be removed ( like
hbdoc itself ).

It's not DirectX by far, it's just DirectDraw,
so "hbw32ddr" may be better.

That's the point of it. We have just some bits of Windows
specific stuff implemented, but this contrib could
hold all the rest Win32 specific. I saw no point in
splitting Win32 stuff into separate libs since it's just
makes life harder for everyone and redundancy is likely.
DDraw could be part of this, but it's .cpp and doesn't
really work, so I left it there for now.

I'd vote to "hbw32" to be in sync with "hbw32ddr",
it's also shorter, yet clear.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi,

Using Visual C# 2003 give some command line error I can solve, but wich do not avoid Harbour to work.

I also receive many compile warning like this one ;

source\common\hbfopen.c(59) : warning C4996: 'fopen': This function or variable may be unsafe. Consider using fopen_s instead. To disable deprecation, use _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS. See online help for details.
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\INCLUDE\stdio.h(234) : see declaration of 'fopen'

I will check the compile log to see the best to do.

Regards,

JF,

fopen_s() is part of currently discussed new STDLIB which
should resolve problem with race condition in exclusive
access to files. If you can exactly check when MS added this
functions and in which MSC versions then we can use it covered
by valid #if ... but because in some cases we may need shared
access (MS implemented _EXCLUSIVE_ mode in this functions not
O_EXCL open flag) then we should use fsopen_s() (or other name
I do not know how they called shared version of fopen_s())
Or better I suggest to leave it as is in this case because it's
not accepted standard yet so it may change in the future and
is highly possible that when it will be standard then MS will
drop STDLIB at all.
hbfopen.c contains only single function so if you want you can
even add
    #define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS.
to this file to pacify this warning without risk that it will
hide also some really important warning messages.

See current hbfsapi.c - I added at the begining of this file:
   #if !defined( FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE )
      #define FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE       0x00000040
   #endif

It should resolve the problem.

This was only an example. We have also USHORT parameter in
hb_vmDo()/hb_vmSend() and some other things which should be
fixed. String items use ULONG for size and it's correct in
*nixes - long should be big enough to hold void * but not
for MS and in WIN64 ULONG is 32bit integer so maximum string
size is limited in this platform to 4GB (in fact 2GB because
some functions needs negative indexes). In few years when we
will have 64bit machines much more RAM then it will be noticeable
limit, f.e. it will not be possible to read DVD image into
single character variable.
All such things should be fixed but if we touch many of them
then it will break binary compatibility (f.e. changing hb_vmDo()
parameters) so it's not easy decision when to do that.
First we should look at current API and code to decide which
functions should be changed and what types we should introduce.

I'm all for these modifications and I'm ready to
contribute.

How do you see it, should we introduce special
Harbour C types for our purposes, or can we use
plain standard C types by cleverly choosing them?

Hi there!

Are there any method of detecting the compiling platform?
I'm porting an Clipper5.3b application to linux/harbour and win32/harbour...
In win32, my special, accented national characters are OK, but under 
linux, few of by chars are damaged.  (Original app uses cp852)

What to do?
Thanks.

REQUEST HB_CODEPAGE_XX is ok for standalone apps, but what is the proper 
method of compiling projects under linux?

Now i'm using hbcmp and then hblnk the objects - what to do?

now i'm using this script to compile:

#! /bin/bash
for i in module0 module1 module7 nyz about
do
hbcmp source/$i.prg -n      -oobj/$i
done
hblnk obj/about.o obj/module0.o obj/module1.o obj/module7.o  obj/nyz.o  
-gtxwc -lcodepage -gtcrs -oPROG/menulnx.exe  -static

but i get:

obj/module0.o:(.data+0xcc8): undefined reference to 
`HB_FUN_HB_CODEPAGE_CP852'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

If i compile a few byte test program using harbour/hbgcc it works.

Yes but for this we can use different function name.
We can reserve some function names as i18n interface
with some restrictions and we can add their alternatives
using different names without any restrictions.
In this case I think about catching possible typos during
compilation. But maybe it's not very important. Probably
some tool to collect all literal strings used in source
code but not addressed by hb_i18n_gettext() translation
will be more useful because it may help to locate strings
which needs translations. Probably we should also think
about adding compile time source code CP translations with
UTF8 support (at least in source until we will not support
Unicode inside HVM items). And of course we need some helper
functions for easier string modification like .prg level
SPRINTF().

Set translation to the CP used by your Linux box.
I guess you are Hungarian so make:

    request HB_CODEPAGE_HU852
    request HB_CODEPAGE_HUISO
    proc main()
       HB_SETCODEPAGE("HU852") 	// internal application encoding
       HB_SETTERMCP( "HUISO" )	// terminal input/output encoding

Can we have more than 65535 parameters in function call? If yes, or if 
there are other reasons for doing that, then we should do that, because 
it will be more difficult to do change after 1.0, 2.0, etc. releases.

Out of topic: Personaly me, I do not understand why we are chasing for 
version numbers 1.0, 2.0, etc. In Open Source "market" I see a lot of 
good software under versions 0.8.2, etc., and usually I trust it more 
than software having versions 9.15 or 13.9.

It was interesting to look how MSWin solves the issue about string size. 
In many places it uses SIZE_T data type. In other places DWORD32, 
DWORD64 is used to maintain "backward compatibility" with older function 
definitions containing DWORD type.

I think we can do it after stable binaries release. But we should try to 
collect all changes that breaks binary compatibility in one place to 
avoid many incompatible versions.

We should first find limits (string size, dynsym table size, parameter 
count, etc) can be reached, if we will move to 64,128,etc platforms or 
if huge applications are used.

I always vote for making solutions the right way, even if it drops some 
compatibility.

Hi,


the sad news is that the situation is the same as 3 months ago. 
Developing of final applications takes many time, and it stops me from 
writing some core code like remote GUI terminal. I also have an idea to 
rewrite my report generator under harbour, but this is also on the long 
queue.

SPRINTF() is not the best for this purpose, since it
cannot swap positions of passed strings. It often happens
that variables need to be inserted in different order
in different languages.

So I'm using something like this:
? StrFormat( hb_i18n_gettext( "Full name: %1 %2" ), cFirstName,  
cLastName )

%1 will be replaced by cFirstName, %2 with cLastName,
whereever they appear in the format string.

Hi,

I've looked to gettext library docs. It has real world examples with 
non-literal strings. It Harbour code it will not be efficient 
implementation, but in C it is:

LOCAL aI
    aI := {hb_i18n_gettext_noop("Monday"), ;
           ...,
           hb_i18n_gettext_noop("Saturday"), ;
           hb_i18n_gettext_noop("Sunday")}
    ? hb_i18n_getext( aI[ nDayOfWeek ] )

hb_i18n_gettext_noop() indicates, that its argument should be added to 
.pot file, but function gettext_noop() does not exists. In C it is 
achieved by
   #define gettext_noop( string )  ( string )
in Harbour, expression optimizer reduces function call to it's first 
argument. In this case argument can be literal only, and of cause we 
need a warning, or even error.

We can extend gettext functionality to catch more possible typos, for 
example:
   hb_i18n_gettext() - allows non-literal strings;
   hb_i18n_gettext_strict() - allows literal strings only, and 
expression optimizer reduces this call to hb_i18n_gettext();
   _( <string> ) is preprocessed to hb_i18n_gettext_strict().

If user will need non-literal argument for hb_i18n_gettext(), he must 
use the explicit function call, in more general case he will use _( 
"string" ).

I've implemented h_i18n_gettext_noop(), but haven't committed it yet. I 
can add hb_i18n_gettext_strict() implementation, if we agree on the idea 
and function names proposed.


> Probably we should also think
> about adding compile time source code CP translations with
> UTF8 support (at least in source until we will not support
> Unicode inside HVM items). 

Why do we need compile time translations? We need to write our .prg code 
with UTF8 editor only. If I write
   ? "??uolas"   // Lithuanian for "Oak"
and my editor saves .prg file in UTF8, then my string will be UTF8. We 
need only to support is our terminal does not work in UTF8:
        HB_SETCODEPAGE("UTF8")
        HB_SETTERMCP("windows-1257")
One more thing is storing of string in .dbf. To avoid conversions 
between dbf codepage and UTF8, it would be good to tore data in UTF8 
also (or RDD should do transparent CP conversion).

The only support from compiler we need is: ignore UTF8 "byte-order 
marker", and do not give compile time errors if first tree byte of .prg 
are: EF BB BF.

But I guess you imagine UTF8 implementation concept in other way, I'll 
be glad to hear your opinion.


> And of course we need some helper
> functions for easier string modification like .prg level
> SPRINTF().

You read my mind. I've just wanted to write a letter about it, but I 
want to find a good solution to propose.
Harbour lacks a standard formating function, to avoid:
   ? "Item: " + LTRIM(NAME) + " Amount: " + LTRIM(STR(AMOUNT)) + " 
Price: " + LTRIM(STR(PRICE))
The problem is that C printf syntax does not fit well to high-level, 
untyped variable language like Harbour, so we need very different type 
specifiers, etc. But from the other hand we want to be it C compatible.

%s and %d are the most popular in C, and I'd like to have (but maybe it 
is only because of old habits).

In Harbour we need to indicate type: character, numeric, date, logical, 
etc., and formating: trim, ltrim, str(, width, dec), alignment.
We can even omit type characters, but sometimes it is very usefull, for 
example:
   cQuery = sprintf("select * from table where id=%d", id)
If id is not numeric, "where id=0" cause will be formated. This can help 
to protect against cases then id is string like "0 or id!=0". This very 
useful in PHP, to stop WWW page hacking by entering valid SQL or HTML 
code into WWW form's input fields.
Of cause we can implement %a with meaning "anytype". It can replace 
number by LTRIM(STR(num)), string by TRIM(string), date by DTOC(date), etc.
One more extension I find useful is %2$d %1$s syntax. Some languages 
implements this to indicate parameter number. It will not be used in 
single language application code, but it will be very useful for 
formating of i18n strings.

One more problem could be function name :)
I find sprintf() or hb_sprintf() a bad choice. We'll only partially 
support original sprintf() syntax, so this name will be confusing. I 
suggest using hb_format(). This name is general, but it should be short 
and general, because function has a general widely used functionality.

I agree with everything, especially this last one.

The later we do it, the harder it will be, since
natural "resistance" will be higher.

[ See Windows for a product which never considered
to do it this way (except for std C RTL functions
maybe ;) (and yet they don't manage real-life app
compatibility anyway.) ]

We cannot in normal explicit calls but it's possible using some
constructions like hb_execfromarray(), multi value macros, etc.
Now due to casting it's possible to create interesting HVM stack
overflow/corruption.

I agree but due to current stay we cannot add new features which
will need fundamental modifications in core code. I cannot even
start real devel branch because practice shows that people drops
beta one following the new features. We do not need version 1.0
but we need to release stable version and unblock farther developing.

Many years ago when I've seen Win32 API I said that MS will have
very big troubles with 54bit ports. It was classic example of
fatal design decisions. Now Win64 and this tricks with LONG is
only results wrong decisions taken many years ago.

docs/limits.txt can be good file to start such documentation,
then we can decide which limits we should eliminate.

I agree but I will not take such decision myself. It should be group
agreement because it's not critical modification.

my vote for hb_strFormat() which puts this function
in the string "namespace", since it's essentially
a string manipulating function. An StrTran() on steroids.

But I'd still do it differently than sprintf(), see my
other mail.

Some addition: I'd not make this function too complicated,
as %1, %2, ... are used this way in many places, so if we
add support for decorating these with modifiers, the
translations file won't be easily portable between other
systems and Harbour.

So, I'd say Harbour should try to convert every types to
a string automatically, and if this default is not good
for the user, the parameter can be manually converted to
a string in the way the user likes.

Default case:
hb_strFormat( "Today is %1", Date() ) -> "Today is 2007/11/29" (using  
DToC())

Special case:
hb_strFormat( "Today is %1, DToS( Date() ) ) -> "Today is 20071129"

The most usual conversions are IMO:
- string: no conversion
- numeric: LTrim( Str( ) )
- date: DToC()
- logical: not very typical usage, maybe "T" / "F"
- rest: empty string

We already have quite some sophisticated string conversion
methods in Clipper/Harbour (like Transform()), so I'm not
sure if adding yet another one is the right thing to do.

Brgds,
Viktor

It can using <n>$ format parameter which comes from
Single Unix Specification.

    printf( "First name is %2$s, last name is %1$s\n",
            cLastName, cFirstName );

or:
    printf( "What is correct:\n(1) %s %s\n(2) %2$s %1$s\n",
            cLastName, cFirstName );


full printf() specification has many features like alignment and
justification, parameter position and size position, etc.
I agree with Mindaugas that it should be our own implementation
which will be addopted to our item types so we can use different
name:
    HB_FORMAT( <cFormat>, ... ) => <cResult>
is OK for me but we can adopt from printf() many features.
Probably it should be mix of C printf() and Clipper TRANSFORM()
functionality. The bad thing is that I haven't widely used
TRANSFORM() and pictures in Clipper and I my natural choices will
be closer to C so I suggest that someone else will define our
format specification. I can only give some advices.

Exactly and I may want to convert them to some CP automatically
during compilation. Just like I may want to make conversion from
some CP to UTF8.
But as long as we will not have Unicode support in HVM with Unicode
collation tables then many code encoded in UTF8 will not work at all
because HVM cannot sort such strings correctly. Even with Unicode
support the collation algorithm is complicated thing. Some people

If user will want it. Automatic conversion between given CP and UTF8
can be very easy implemented when we will have Unicode suppot in HVM.
Our string item can use some flag to mark conversion state: multibyte
character string, Utf8, widechar character string and HVM should support
all necessary conversions. We should also define extended C API functions
so 3-rd party code will work well without any modification with any HVM
mode and passed items. F.e. we should have:
    hb_parc_utf8( int iParam ) -> <utf8Str>
    hb_parc_u16( int iParam ) -> <u16Str>
    hb_parwc( int iParam ) -> <wcStr>
    hb_retc_utf8( char * utf8Str )
    hb_retc_u16( char * u16Str )
    hb_retwc( wchar * wcStr )

We can add them soon even without Unicode support in HVM they will be
useful because they will make HVM_CP <-> WC|U16|UTF8 modifications.
When we will have Unicode string items in HVM external code without
any additional modifications will be able to use them.

We should recognize this signature and set default source CP as UTF8.
When user set target CP as ISO-8859-1 then we should make all necessary
translation in literal strings automatically. User may even prefer
to use internally U16/WC encoding not UTF8. It will depend on our
Unicode implementation in HVM - in some cases fixed size encoding
is more efficient.

Nothing amazing - the interface should be transparent for old and new
code so C code will work with any HVM encoding or version. We should
hide as much conversion as possible inside core code.
Please remember that in some cases UTF8 in source code is user
choice forced only by used editor/platform and he may want to
use single CP inside HVM so compile time conversion will be very
useful to avoid calling iconv or other similar tools from make
files.

Exactly and such code makes translations much harder because short
words can have different meaning which depends on context.

Yes, it's important.

Also many C printf() implementation supports it, f.e. GLIBC.

It's OK for me. Also Viktor's proposition with hb_strFormat().

These two warnings should be left to mark code which should be fixed in the
future. Now it's not dangerous because the only one bit which can be
lost during this conversion is HB_FS_LOCAL and it's passed in .hrb files
in different way but it may be a problem in the future so new .hrb format
should use bigger holder for symbol scope bit field.

You can do it at any speed you want. When will the Beta 4 release happen? Do 
you want me to call the shots on when the releases must happen so we have 
hard deadlines? I can do that, but we've never done that before. Setting 
deadlines for volunteers is tricky business.

In order for 1.0 to be released, the requirement to stop adding new 
code/enhancements and only work on bug fixes will have to be enforced.

Missing functionality will have to wait.

Hi,


the sad news is that the situation is the same as 3 months ago. 
Developing of final applications takes many time, and it stops me from 
writing some core code like remote GUI terminal. I also have an idea to 
rewrite my report generator under harbour, but this is also on the long 
queue.

Hi,


internal format for saving form/template is not very important. XML is 
one of the choices.
Final result should something prepared for rendered on screen or paper: 
WMF/EMF for windows (I don't know what is analogue for unix), PDF, HTML, 
RTF, etc.


Best regards,
Mindaugas

Hi Enrico,

I've noticed you're using -gc3 switch to compile Harbour,
which is the native code output type, and will generate
a much bigger (but faster) binary.

Try with -gc2 to compare with xhb.

Viktor

Hi,


I'll try to make a guess :)
It's, -gc3 used for Harbour build :)

Yes, I'd tend to remove this lib.

I agree with both hbdoc and pdflib. pdflib compiles
but doesn't work and the source looks suspiciously
broken.

hbdoc also has it's problems. I think we should first
remove the pdf part of it since it doesn't work at all,
and keep hbdoc until we decide on another tool
(robodoc, doxygen, etc).

If there is not objection, I'll remove these thing
from the repository in a few days:

/contrib/htmllib/
/contrib/pdflib/

Hi Przemek, Lorenzo and all,

Pls see this updated and extended proposal for

Yes, it was that, thank you. Using -gc2, the Harbour generated EXE is even 
smaller than the xHarbour one.

hbhsx or hbhs, it's HiPer-SEEK / CFTS compatible library

OK,

rather hbnulrdd and hbusrrdd, these are not RDDs but dummy RDD subsystem
replacement for programs which do not need RDD functionality (nulsys)
and library to write new or change/overload existing RDDs using .prg
code only (usrrdd).

You compiled Harbour with STD GT set as default.
You have to link default buildtime GT driver if you do not
use ANNOUNCE HB_GTSYS in your code. It's exactly the same
situation as with GTWIN you reported few days ago and the
only one difference is that you had WIN GT set as default
and now you have STD GT.
Please remember that Harbour RTL in final binaries always
force linking default build time GT and you can disable it
by adding ANNOUNCE HB_GTSYS to one of linked objects or
libraries if they are before RTL.

It;s due to my wrong move of HB_GT_LIB to common.mak.
Should be ok again now. Sorry for enconvenience :(.

Okey, noted everything, thanks.

(I've choosen hbbmcdx - because it's not a layered
rdd, so it's cdx only -, and hbhsx from your
options)

I'll start with contribs.

I write my propouses, but what about when mt libs will be created?

Or the same lib will be multithread and single one at the same time?

Subject: [Harbour] Problem with MySQL wrapper - Counted strings  - help
Message-ID: <649421.16471.qm@web30715.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

MySQL wrapper /contrib/mysql/mysql.c has problems with BLOB type fields
All fields are truncated after first occurence of NULL byte.

This is excerpt from MySQL C API reference manual:

MYSQL_ROW
=========
     This is a type-safe representation of one row of data. It is
     currently implemented as an array of counted byte strings.  (You
     cannot treat these as null-terminated strings if field values may
     contain binary data, because such values may contain null bytes
     internally.)  Rows are obtained by calling `mysql_fetch_row() and 
     lengths are obtained by calling mysql_fetch_lengths()


This is the original function modified to get correct array item length
information.
I am not familiar with "C" programming so could someone try to find a
solution?


HB_FUNC( SQLFETCHR ) // MYSQL_ROW *mysql_fetch_row(MYSQL_RES *)
{
   MYSQL_RES *mresult = (MYSQL_RES *)_parnl( 1 );
   int i;
   int num_fields = mysql_num_fields( mresult );

   // correct lengths of blob fields:
   unsigned long *lengths = mysql_fetch_lengths( mresult );

   PHB_ITEM aRow = hb_itemArrayNew( num_fields );
   PHB_ITEM temp;

   // typedef char **MYSQL_ROW;	return data as array of strings
   MYSQL_ROW mrow = mysql_fetch_row( mresult );

   if( mrow )
      for( i = 0; i < num_fields; i++ )
      {
         // how to pass the whole mrow array item to Harbour?

         temp = hb_itemPutC( NULL, ( mrow[i]!=NULL )? mrow[i] : "" );
         hb_arraySet( aRow, i + 1, temp );
         hb_itemRelease( temp );
      }
   hb_itemReturn( aRow );
   hb_itemRelease( aRow );
}


Sincerely,

Mitja

Nice that it can catch it.
I'll clean hb_vmPushMacroBlock() declaration in a while.

All of the above are on TOFIX list and this warnings are only part
of bigger problem. It will have to wait for some MS-Win developer
who will want to fix the code.

If I am understanding correctly, we are heading towards MT and multi-window
console ? 
If yes, GREAT !!!

It would be good to know the reasons why xhb has separate MT libs,
(since for example XBase++ doesn't).

> Or the same lib will be multithread and single one at the same time?

IMO, if there is any technical chance to keep a single lib after
implementing MT, that's what we should do, and MT support should
be enabled by default on platforms supporting it.

Having one common lib is much more elegant and easier for the
user (and also for the build processes).
