Not yet.

I think that some people are.

I've got a set of small modifications for problems I detected
myself and some others reported by people who sent informations
directly to me. I can commit them soon.

They are in BETA1 branch - it's enough to you once make
checkout for BETA1 and then you can simply make update
(without -A) to keep BETA1 tree updated.
When we collect more modifications (if any) then we will
make new release with separate tag.

This is a working sample:

FUNCTION MAIN()

    LOCAL GetList := {}

    LOCAL nTask := HB_IDLEADD( { || MyTimer() }, 1000 )

    LOCAL cVar := SPACE( 35 )

    CLS

    @ 10, 10 SAY "Name:" GET cVar

    READ

    HB_IDLEDEL( nTask )

    ? cVar

    INKEY( 0 )

    RETURN NIL


STATIC FUNCTION MYTIMER()

    LOCAL nRow := ROW()
    LOCAL nCol := COL()

    @ 0, 60 SAY TIME()

    SETPOS( nRow, nCol )

    MSETCURSOR( .F. )

    RETURN NIL

I personally am trying to implement the new build so that I can test - 
Unfortunately, I first have to switch 3rd party development tools so that I 
can use the new Beta build - I don't know about anyone else, but a couple 
more weeks (or more!) would be helpful to allow for testing.

    cvs checkout -r beta1

will switch your repository to beta1 branch and then all other CVS
commands like update, commit, ... will work on the beta1 branch.
If you will want to switch back to devel branch then used checkout
or update with -A switch. Instead of switching between branches
you can also create second repository copy on your local disk
and keep in one of them beta1 branch and on second devel.

Phil,

I'm an experienced Clipper programmer who recently started using Harbour.  I've 
been very impressed.  I think you are being much too conservative in calling the 
most recent build a beta and the build before that an alpha.  They both feel 
like full release products to me.

I remember when Harbour started out in 2000.  I thought it was a great idea, but 
I could see it would be quite a while before it could be used as a full product. 
  So I forgot about it, until just a few weeks ago.  Now I can see that you have 
substantially reached your goal.  And you've added quite a few extensions.  It 
looks great.  Congratulations and thank you to all the developers.

Maybe people are actually using it for real development.  That's what I'm doing.

I'm using HMG, which currently uses alpha 46.  I hope Roberto will be able to 
upgrade it to Beta 1 soon.

Installation is one thing I hope Harbour will improve on.  Before I found out 
about HMG, I spent a long time trying but not succeeding in puzzling out how to 
install Harbour along with everything else it needed.  For me at least, HMG has 
put it all into a package that is easy to install and use.

Documentation is another thing I hope Harbour can improve on.  It's been a 
pleasant surprise to find that Harbour has so many great extensions beyond 
Clipper, but it's been hard to find out about them, because development has so 
far outstripped documentation.

After a few weeks of poking through various web sites, I ended up downloading 
the full Harbour installation and source code (versus the stripped down version 
of Harbour in HMG), not to build programs with, but so I can see the 
documentation in the source code and its relationship to the binaries.

Thanks again for an excellent product.

Kevin

    + added internal item structure hb_struRecover - it's not real item
      but this structure is used to keep information about BEGIN SEQUENCE
      data - it reduce HB_STACK usage
    + added support for ALWAYS clause in BEGIN SEQUENCE
      The syntax is:
         BEGIN SEQUENCE
            <code>
         [ RECOVER [ USING oErr ] ]
            <recoverCode>
         [ ALWAYS ]
            <alwaysCode>
         END [ SEQUENCE ]
      It's guaranteed that <alwaysCode> is _ALWAYS_ executed even if
      inside <code> or <recoverCode> some new exceptions like RETURN,
      BREAK or QUIT will appear.
      Please note that when the following code is executed:
         BEGIN SEQUENCE
            <code>
         ALWAYS
            <alwaysCode>
         END
      (without RECOVER clause) then BREAK exception inside <code> is not
      recovered, <alwaysCode> is executed and then BREAK exception is
      passed to outer BEGIN SEQUENCE. This is the same semantic as
      used in TRY / [ CATCH ] / FINALLY / END
      Those of you who prefer to use TRY / CATCH / FINALLY / END instead
      of BEGIN SEQUENCE / RECOVER / ALWAYS / END can simply add to your
      source code:
         #command TRY               => BEGIN SEQUENCE
         #command CATCH [ oErr ]    => RECOVER [ USING <oErr> ]
      and:
         errorBlock( {|oErr| break( oErr ) } )
      Though instead of 'break( oErr )' I suggest to use some small function
      which will support some basic recovery/substitute operations like in
      default errorsys() and LockErrHandler() to not break existing code
      which may depends on the default behavior.
      If you want I can add direct support for TRY / CATCH / FINALLY / END
      but I'm not sure it's really necessary.
      Please note also that in Harbour ALWAYS code is execute even for QUIT
      excpetion.
      When <alwaysCode> is executed current exception is stored and restored
      when is finished. If new exception appears inside <alwaysCode> then
      restored exception depends on the priority in the following order:
         QUIT     // highest priority
         BREAK
         RETURN
      If both exceptions have the same priority and contain additional value
      (error object in BREAK or return value in RETURN) then the recently set
      one is restored. It's similar behavior to destructor code.

Enrico/Przemek,

It's OK now. I am using my favourite command line CVS.EXE that I used
since the start of this project and never looked at Tortoise.

I found the correct command:

  CVS co -r beta1 harbour

Thanks again.

Is it possible to use TBrowse to edit , delete and add also ? instead of

Ardo,

The TBrowse class is a nice piece of software. I love it because is an 
excelent example of data abstraction. Nothing in the class refers to 
data, it's responsibility of the class user to deal with data. That 
means that data is not only dbf but function, arrays, another objects 
like querys, and any source that appears in the future.
There are several implementations of add, delete and edit functions 
around, just look into the Browse() function to see an example.
Look into the clipper 5.3 examples, there are lot's of them.

Regards,

Carlos.

Perhaps one more difference between BEGIN SEQUENCE/RECOVER and TRY/CATCH 
exists. BEGIN SEQUENCE has default hidden empty RECOVER sentence, but 
TRY does not has it. Thus,
        TRY
        END
is meanless and causes compile error. And the true analogue for
        BEGIN SEQUENCE
           // code
        END SEQUENCE
is
        TRY
           // code
        CATCH  // empty catch sentence
        END.

This small semantical difference is important. Example:
        TRY
           // do something
           TRY
             // open temporary file
             // DO SOME JOB
           FINALLY
             // close and delete temporary file
           END
           // do something more
        CATCH
           // catch all exceptions,including exceptions of DO SOME JOB!
        END

It is possible to do the same using BEGIN SEQUENCE semantics, but do NOT 
forget about passing exception to the outer BEGIN/END SEQUENCE:
        BEGIN SEQUENCE
           // do something
           BEGIN SEQUENCE
             // open temporary file
             // DO SOME JOB
           RECOVER USING oErr
              BREAK(oErr)   // pass exception!!!
           ALWAYS
             // close and delete temporary file
           END SEQUENCE
           // do something more
        RECOVER
           // catch all exeptions, including exceptions of DO SOME JOB!
        END SEQUENCE

Right click harbour folder, CVS, Update Special. Then mark Get 
tag/branch/revision, Update list, select "beta1" in the combobox, Ok.

It's blocked in compiler though with recent modifications I made
HVM ready for it so it's enough to comment the protection code.

Exactly.

    BEGIN SEQUENCE
        <code>
    ALWAYS
        <alwaysCode>
    END

works in the same way as:
    TRY
        <code>
    FINALLY
        <alwaysCode>
    END

without catching BREAK exception.

It's not necessary because it's default behavior.
BEGIN SEQUENCE with ALWAYS and without RECOVER does not catch BREAK
exception.
I intentionally encoded it in such way so the #command(s) I presented
gives expected behavior for TRY/FINALLY/END but of course I can change
it. Seems that I was not clear enough in ChangeLog when I wrote:

      Please note that when the following code is executed:
         BEGIN SEQUENCE
            <code>
         ALWAYS
            <alwaysCode>
         END
      (without RECOVER clause) then BREAK exception inside <code> is not
      recovered, <alwaysCode> is executed and then BREAK exception is
      passed to outer BEGIN SEQUENCE. This is the same semantic as
      used in TRY / [ CATCH ] / FINALLY / END

It's good.

So, BEGIN/END SEQUENCE has default empty RECOVER sentence, only if 
ALWAYS does not exists. That was not clear for me, thanks for 
clearification. I think such behaviour is OK.

Hi Antonio,

Thanks for your suggestion.  I tried it.  It installed Harbour very nicely.  But 
that's all it installed.  No C compiler, no Windows resources.  A newbie needs 
more than this - he needs everything necessary to create an EXE from one or more 
PRGs.  This includes a C compiler and some kind of easy-to-understand make tool.

It probably should also include Windows libraries and a way of using them with 
Harbour, since most people don't just want to do console applications.  IOW a 
Harbour distribution should provide everything necessary for a way of easily 
creating a Windows EXE from PRGs.

This combination is what I found with HMG.  The COMPILE.BAT program in HMG, 
while a very small part of the distribution, was absolutely key in getting me 
started quickly with Harbour.  This batch file takes you from a PRG to an EXE in 
one quick and easy step.  It let me get get my feet wet right away with a hello 
world program.  Then I started tweaking the batch file and before long was 
moving on to real world Windows applications.

Another key feature of HMG is the REFERENCE.TXT file.  This is a very brief 
summary of the GUI commands in HMG.  This was also key in helping me to quickly 
transition from DOS to Windows programming.

Both COMPILE.BAT and REFERENCE.TXT are prominently located in the root directory 
of the installation.  This made them easy to find and use.

Hi to all

There is a LOCAL variable initialized by zero.

Changed its value by incremental addition ( += ) operator.

No always, but "sometimes", at this point this run time error occurs :

      Error BASE/1081 Argument error: +

When putting a message statement ( WAIT, ALERT etc ) for inspect
variable's value and type, immediately before error point; error not
occured.

More interesting, after message statement deleted; no error occured.

I can't present an example because of this "sometimes" condition.

I am using Build 46; for BETA1 I am waiting Roberto :(

Any suggestion ?

Best regards.

                    ^^^^^^^^^^^
Harbour is not Windows only project. Of course it's the most popular
Harbour port. The said is that Windows developers are not interesting
in creating some tools which can hide C compiler used as Harbour backend.
In the past I created some set of BASH scrpits which makes such job for
GCC so now in *nixes just after Harbour installation you can simply
make
    hbmk -n -w -es2 tst.prg && ./tst
and it will compile and run tst.prg. This scripts can be also used in
Windows with MSYS for MinGW build and they are makeing what you are
asking for. Below I'm attaching their small description which is a part
of RPMs Harbour distribution. Please read it. I create these scripts
many years ago and I'm still asking Windows developers to create
their pure C version for these users which are not working with BASH
environment - f.e. standard Windows installation. Seems that no one
is interesting in such job. So now only in different *nixes Harbour
can be used "out of the box" just after installation without any
knowldge about C compiler, environment setting, etc.

Przemek


README.RPM
==========
This RPM distribution of Harbour includes extra commands to make compiling
and linking with Harbour a little easier. There are compiler and linker
wrappers called "hbcc", "hbcmp", "hblnk" and "hbmk".

"hbcc" is a wrapper to the C compiler only. It sets all flags
and paths necessary to compile .c files which include Harbour header
files. The result of its work is an object file.

Use "hbcmp" exactly as you would use the harbour compiler itself.
The main difference with hbcmp is that it results in an object file,
not a C file that needs compiling down to an object. hbcmp also
ensures that the harbour include directory is seen by the harbour compiler.

"hblnk" simply takes a list of object files and links them together
with the harbour virtual machine and run-time library to produce an
executable. The executable will be given the basename of the first object
file if not directly set by the "-o" command line switch.

"hbmk" tries to produce an executable from your .prg file. It's a simple
equivalent of cl.bat from the CA-Clipper distribution.

All these scripts accept command line switches:
-o<outputfilename>      # output file name
-static                 # link with static Harbour libs
-fullstatic             # link with all static libs
-shared                 # link with shared libs (default)
-mt                     # link with multi-thread libs
-gt<hbgt>               # link with <hbgt> GT driver, can be repeated to
                        # link with more GTs. The first one will be
                        #      the default at runtime
-xbgtk                  # link with xbgtk library (xBase GTK+ interface)
-hwgui                  # link with HWGUI library (GTK+ interface)
-l<libname>             # link with <libname> library
-fmstat                 # link with the memory statistics lib
-nofmstat               # do not link with the memory statistics lib (default)
-[no]strip              # strip (no strip) binaries
-main=<main_func>       # set the name of main program function/procedure.
                        # if not set then 'MAIN' is used or if it doesn't
                        # exist the name of first public function/procedure
                        # in first linked object module (link)

Link options work only with "hblnk" and "hbmk" and have no effect
in "hbcc" and "hbcmp".
Other options are passed to Harbour/C compiler/linker.
To save compatibility with older rpm distributions, "gharbour" can be used
as a synonym of "hbcmp", and "harbour-link" as synonym of "hblnk"

An example compile/link session looks like:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
druzus@uran:~/tmp$ cat foo.prg
function main()
? "Hello, World!"
return nil

druzus@uran:~/tmp$ hbcmp foo
Harbour Compiler Alpha build 46.2 (Flex)
Copyright 1999-2006, http://www.harbour-project.org/
Compiling 'foo.prg'...
Lines 5, Functions/Procedures 2
Generating C source output to 'foo.c'... Done.

druzus@uran:~/tmp$ hblnk foo.o

druzus@uran:~/tmp$ strip foo

druzus@uran:~/tmp$ ls -l foo
-rwxrwxr-x    1 druzus   druzus       3824 maj 17 02:46 foo
----------------------------------------------------------------------

or using hbmk only:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
druzus@uran:~/tmp$ cat foo.prg
function main()
? "Hello, World!"
return nil

druzus@uran:~/tmp$ hbmk foo
Harbour Compiler Alpha build 46.2 (Flex)
Copyright 1999-2006, http://www.harbour-project.org/
Compiling 'foo.prg'...
Lines 5, Functions/Procedures 2
Generating C source output to 'foo.c'... Done.

druzus@uran:~/tmp$ ls -l foo
-rwxrwxr-x    1 druzus   druzus       3824 maj 17 02:46 foo
----------------------------------------------------------------------


In this RPM you will find additional wonderful tools: /usr/bin/pprun
You can run clipper/xbase compatible source files with it if you only
put in their first line:
#!/usr/bin/pprun

For example:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
druzus@uran:~/tmp$ cat foo.prg
#!/usr/bin/pprun
function main()
? "Hello, World!, This is a script !!! :-)"
return nil

druzus@uran:~/tmp$ chmod +x foo.prg

druzus@uran:~/tmp$ ./foo.prg


I hope this RPM is useful. Have fun with Harbour.

Hi Przemek,

Thanks for your message.  Sorry, I did forget that Harbour is also for 
non-Windows OS.

I'm glad that you saw the need for an equivalent to the Clipper CL.BAT file. 
What you wrote for *nix looks very good.

You say that Windows developers are not interested in developing similar tools, 
but this is just what Roberto has done in HMG.

Thanks for all you've done for Harbour.

Kevin

Hi, its been a while since I last rebuilt Harbour was busy with other
project.

With the lastest devel changelog 2007-02-09 00:28 UTC+0100 Viktor
Szakats (harbour.01 syenar.hu), and my standard BCC32 environment,
Harbour is built without any new warnings, HBTest gives the same
results as those I made on Jan 17 2007.

Problem:
hbpptest now fail on all 226 tests, it looks like something was
changed in the EOL settings. The Jan 17 2007 build had only 16
failed results.

This is perfect Clipper compatible behavior.

It was one of many problems which existed in old ADS RDD implementation.

Yes, it's EOL incorrectly inserted before preprocessed line.
I'll commit fox in a while.

I tested Clipper 5.2e DBFCDX and the Six Driver RDD for Clipper and both 
leave the file locked after a call to dbAppend() - In addition, there is 
nothing in the Clipper docs to suggest that a file lock is removed by a 
call to dbAppend().

I still believe this needs to be fixed. Please let me know what you think - 
If you still disagree, I will have to fix in this in my copy of Harbour.

Regards,
Randy.

Sorry my fault. I haven't noticed you are talking about FLOCK()
Only other RLOCKs should be removed. I'll check it and if FLOCK()
is really removed then I'll fix it.

Thanks! But what is going to happen the next time the ADS RDD is synced 
with xHarbour - Will we lose this and any other fixes?

Also, I have noticed some fixes to the current build in the last few days - 
Will these fixes also be applied to the Beta release?

Subject: [Harbour] Grid control
Message-ID: <5.2.0.9.0.20070213173856.00cf0080@pop3.pathcom.com>

Hi all,

I am converting to a new Windows GUI tool for use with Harbour but I cannot 
use the Browse/Grid control that is included with it.

Does anyone have a suggestion of a simple/lightweight unbound/virtual 
third-party grid control that would work well in a C/Harbour environment? 
(I only need simple browse capabilities and do _not_ need cell editing).

TIA.

Regards,
Randy.

The SF addresses of project servers has been changed in last year.
Please update the line with:

export CVSROOT=":pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/harbour-project"

to:

export CVSROOT=":pserver:anonymous@harbour-project.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/harbour-project"

Run these script from non root account.
After build process you will find binary RPMs in $HOME/RPM/RPMS/<arch>/
directory. Install them from root account and read
/usr/share/doc/harbour-*/README.RPM

Spiro, which version of 10.x are you running (10.0, 10.1, 10.2)?  
Am curious for other reasons.

      when inside of function some code was included with #include
      For such situation now modified version of HB_P_MODULE is generated
      with module name only but without function name, f.e.:
         HB_P_MODULE    "test.prg:"
      exactly the same form of HB_P_MODULE is used in xHarbour.
      Debugger code should be updated to recognize such HB_P_MODULE version
      Ryszard any chance that you can look at it?
      And what about syncing with xHarbour debugger?
      I can add some missing functions to compiler and HVM but I do not
      want to update next peace of code myself. Sorry but I do not have
      enough time. I'd prefer to finish some other things I'm working.
      If Ryszard is busy can someone else try to port xHarbour debugger
      to Harbour?

Yes, though these I'll leave to the moment when I'll add common to compiler
and preprocessor error list integreated with warning messages. Now it will
be waste of time - just simply I will have to remove it later.

> or Syntax error: '[', which are not reported in Harbour

and this is real incompatibility. Harbour accept such syntax because
in some cases PP cannot detect if '[' should be used as string quoted
character or array index. F.e.:
    while[1]="A"
or:
    if[2]=[2]
If PP does not know anything about language syntax then has to preprocess
the above as array index and then later lexer or grammar parser can convert
it to string. These happens in Harbour where PP is fully separated from
language syntax.
Seems that in Clipper's inside PP there are hardheaded some language
constructions and PP knows that IF, WHILE and some other identifiers
are language keywords with special meaning and preprocess lines differently.
Look at this code:
    proc main()
        local while:={1,2,3,4}, while2:={nil}
        ? while2[1]
        while[1]=[1]
        while2[1]=[1]
        exit
        enddo
        ? while2[1]
    return

For:
    while[1]=[1]
first [1] has to be converted to string and for:
    while2[1]=[1]
it has to be array index.
Personally I do not like it and I strongly prefer clear separation
between preprocessor and compiler. So in these case I think it's
better to document the difference then hack PP to recognize language
keywords. In your example:

    x := [ something ;
    else ]

it's possible to add some trick to PP and mark '[' without closing bracket
in special way so they will not be converted to string later but in fact
I'll only mask the problem because it will be possible to create some PP
rules while will break such marker so IMHO it's better to keep current
behavior. If you have differ opinion then please inform me.
I'm setting CC to harbour devel list so also other users can read it.
If you think that I should block compilation of the above code then I
can do that but personally I'm against.

It's working for me without any problems.
Maybe Phil or someone else can help.

There should be a way to tell PP a list of reserved words. The above line 
should make the PP blow chunks. They don't have to be hardcoded, but there's 
no reason the PP can't be aware of them.

Can you send to me directly?

philb@philb

Do you get a reject message?

You should be able to get to my gmail account ki4dpt@gmail.com so we can 
figure it out. There is a solution.

Aha, found a problem in the way that DNS was set up for this domain.

Corrected part of it and will have reverse DNS corrected when my provider 
corrects it.

The above is perfectly valid code and can be compiled by both
Harbour and Clipper.

I intentionally removed any limitations on reserved words from Harbour
compiler so I'm not a fun of adding some others to PP.
But I read the message I sent and seems I haven't explained what is
the exact problem. So to clarify the situations. 

These code:
    proc main()
    local while:={1,2,3,4}, while2:={nil}, do:={"DO"}, case:={"CASE"},;
          return:={"RETURN"}
    ? (while)[1], while2[1]
    while[1]=[1]
    while2[1]=[2]
    exit
    enddo
    ? (while)[1], while2[1]
    ? (case)[1]
    ? (return)[1]
    ? do[1]
    return
is preprocessed, compiled and executed by Harbour and Clipper in the same
way and gives the same results. But in Clipper I had to make:
    ? (case)[1]
because
    ? case[1]
is not properly preprocessed/compiled by Clipper.

Test shows that Clipper's PP checks only the value of identifiers before
'[' and if it's 'CASE', 'WHILE', 'IF', 'ELSEIF', 'RETURN' then it creates
strings and in other cases it makes array indexes. I can make the same but
it will introduce Clipper limitations to Harbour. Like above Clipper cannot
compile:
    ? whil[1]
and the code has to be changed to:
    ? (whil)[1]
Harbour does not have any problem with such code now. Without adding to PP
some grammar logic to recognize properly statements I can only replicate
exact Clipper behavior.
Anyhow now I can create code which is compiled by Clipper and Harbour in
differ way:
    while [;
    1] = [1]
Harbour will recognize the above as WHILE statement when Clipper as
assigning first item in  WHILE array.
Such construction is the only one I know where it may causes problems in
compilation of Clipper's code and these it the only one serious problem.
In all other cases any valid Clipper code can be preprocessed and compiled
by Harbour.
So the final question probably should be:
should we add early string conversion using hard coded list of statement
keyword with the cost of some limitations but with strict Clipper
compatibility or we can accept the difference. Any "nice" solutions will
cause that some grammar logic will have to be mixed with PP and I do not
want to make sth like that.

best regards,
Przemek

ps. To be precise I haven't described the _EXACT_ Clipper PP behavior but
    rather how it interacts with the code like above. In fact Clipper in
    .ppo files can be seen that Clipper does not make early conversion
    to string.

Ok, now I see it.

So, if it's found in Clipper code being converted to Harbour, does it throw an 
error or does it do the wrong thing silently?

IF and ELSEIF used in Clipper in other context then statement
generates an error.
Mistake with WHILE interpretation will cause unclosed structure error.
Differ interpretation of CASE and RETURN can be caught only when -w
switch is used but it's possible to create the code which will be silently
compiled in differ way by Harbour. This is self contain example:

    proc main()
    ? f()
    return

    func f()
    local retu:={"1"}
    retu[;
    1]='2'
    retu nil

Both Harbour and xHarbour (old PP) display:
    .F.
when Clipper:
    NIL

I know that the code has to be in very exotic form and at least three very
important conditions has to appear simultaneously but it's possible to create
such example which is cleanly compiled but gives differ results at runtime
(Warning: Unreachable code with -w2 Harbour switch can also be hidden by
small modification:

    func f()
    local retu:={"1"}
    if .t.
      retu[;
      1]='2'
    endif
    retu nil

and these begins to be important reason to make PP 100% Clipper
compatible in this case even if it will cause some limitations.
Other opinions?

As long as it doesn't fail silently and the conditions are very 
circumstantial, I'd move along to something more important.

When it errors out, which will not happen often, it can be debugged and 
corrected.

I would be far more worried about fixing it if it failed silently.

The question is what 'failed' means. For sure there are not technical
problems with current behavior or some unexpected results. The problem
is that is some very seldom situations it does not work exactly like
Clipper and it will be very hard to replicate the exact Clipper behavior
because it has some unpleasure bugs. F.e. compile and run this code
using Clipper:

    proc main()
    ? f()
    return
    func f()
    return [[]]

See also Clipper's .ppo output.
IMHO support for string quoting by [] in Clipper was added to existing
code and author(s) simply hacked it in the easiest way. The final
results is as is. With the exception to some bugs like above I replicated
it and in summary there is only one difference: strings inside [] just
after identifiers like RETURN, IF, ELSEIF, WHILE, CASE, WITH (probably
also BREAK) in Harbour can be stored in more then one line concatenated
by ';' and the preprocessor output for them is not silently ignored.
It's not Clipper compatible but IMHO is sth what user expects and
we do not have to worry about some unpredictable results when the
text is preprocessed what can happen in Clipper. F.e.:

    proc main()
    ? f()
    return
    #define ABC Some text
    func f()
    return [ABC]

If you compile the above by Clipper and compare .ppo file with
real application output you will find clear answer how support
for [] quoting was hacked in Clipper's PP. Just simply source
text is "joined" to '[' token and then line is preprocessed in
normal way. Finally when token '[' with joined text is after
RETURN, IF, ELSEIF, CASE, RETURN then instead of preprocessed
token list the "joined" source text is returned and lexer tries
to guess how much from next tokens should be removed. Sometimes
it "guess" correctly and some times we have unpredictable results
like in 'return [[]]' or more interesting example (just copy it
as is):

    proc p()
    return [1=[2]
    have you ever
    expected that this code
    can be compiled by Clipper?
    ? "Do you think this line will be displayed on the screen?"

Replicating the above is over acceptable by me "bug compatibility".
Just simply it's not possible to keep such behavior and correctly
recognize which tokens should be removed after preprocessing.
As you can see in the above example even without preprocessing Clipper
very serious problems and I can create examples where users may expect
many different results and each of them will be valid preprocessed code.
For me current Harbour behavior is much better and users can understand
what happens checking .ppo files. Now, after some additional tests with
Clipper I do not think I should change anything in current PP but
I'm still open for other opinions.

Hi all,

IMHO, when using the w2 and w3 compiler warning options, it should not warn 
of unused params defined in a code block since many times you need to 
access some, but not all, of the params and this causes unnecessary and 
erroneous warnings. For example:

local a := Array( 10 )
AEval( a, { | x, i | a[i] := Array( 5 ), AFill( a[i], 0 ) } )

In this case, you would get a warning that "x" is not used but you have no 
choice but to define "x in order to obtain access to "i".

Regards,
Randy.

Hello,


this is very common problem. We use solution:
   AEval( a, { | x, i | x, .... } )

And this is a problem not for codeblocks, but for functions also. For 
example, window message handler, always has parameters: wnd_proc(hWnd, 
nMsg, wParam, lParam), but sometimes you do not need the first parameter 
hWnd, so you get the same warning message.

We use such solution:
FUNC wnd_proc(hWnd, nMsg, wParam, lParam)
   UNUSED_VAR(hWnd)
   ....
RETURN ...

PROC UNUSED_VAR()
RETURN

My friend from another company uses:
    hWnd := hWnd

I was thinking about many other solutions like Borland's
   #pragma argsused
but I think the most natural is to allow does not specify parameter 
name, i.e.,
   AEval( a, { | , i | a[i] := Array( 5 ), AFill( a[i], 0 ) } )
or
   FUNC wnd_proc(, nMsg, wParam, lParam)

I second Randy's problem. When hunting down all the unused vars
in my code, I left with a bunch of AEval() codeblocks with no good
resolution to the problem.

The problem with the {|x, y| x, <real code> } solution, is that
it makes the codeblock execution slighly slower, and since
many of these codeblocks are called in tight loops, this is not
ideal.

For the non-codeblock solution, pls note that Harbour has a
macro named HB_SYMBOL_UNUSED() just for that purpose.
Find it in common.ch

Viktor

Another idea would be to expand the warning levels and insert a new level 2 
that would do what it does now but excludes function declarations and code 
blocks from it's unused var checking.

Or, however unelegant, we could introduce per-warning
command line switches.

But in this case, I think it would be much realisitic to simply
not generate the warning, or only generate it in the highest
level (but I doubt it would be useful even then).

Or if we can come up with a suppress method which
won't generate any code (and be inline), it would be good
as well. Any ideas?

HB_SYMBOL_UNUSED() translates to this:
IF .F. ; var := var ; END
which won't generate any code (unless shortcut
optimization is turned off), but this won't work inline.

Brgds,
Viktor

I've tried to use:
    IF(.F., unused_param, NIL)
It can be used for both function body and code block, but it generates 
warning: Meaningless use of expression: 'NIL'

So, I've changed code to
    IF(.F., unused_param, unused_param)
This compiles without warning, but generates code:
	HB_P_PUSHLOCAL[NEAR]
	HB_P_POP

I guess, to eliminate this code it's enough to add the following code to 
function static HB_FIX_FUNC( hb_p_pushlocal ):

   if( pFunc->pCode[ lPCodePos + 3 ] == HB_P_POP &&
       ! hb_compIsJump( cargo->HB_COMP_PARAM, pFunc, lPCodePos + 3 ) )
   {
       hb_compNOOPfill( pFunc, lPCodePos, 4, FALSE, FALSE );
   }
   else
   {
      // ... current code ...
   }


But HB_SYMBOL_UNUSED() should be used. Omiting the name of unused 
variable seams to be a nicer solution.

This does seem to generate quite some pcodes in both cases.

Just an idea, but we could easily solve the problem if the compiler
would automatically optimize out when a variable is assigned
to itself (this rule should not apply to class/object vars and array
elements, maybe more), like:

var := var

Is this doable?

If we would have this feature, HB_SYMBOL_UNUSED( v )
could be defined as ( v := v ) and be used in both cases
with no pcode generated.

Brgds,
Viktor

No, it does not generate any additional PCODEs. check the .c file.

Yes of course, It needs only few lines, just like many other optimizations
still missing.
F.e. the HB_SYMBOL_UNUSED() above uses the fact that !((.t.)) is
not optimized by expression optimizer but only later by PCODE optimizer
so compiler does not report information about unused variable and
no additional code is generated.

Only if this optimization will be done inside PCODE optimizer.
If it will be done in expresion optimizer then we will have
the same situation as now with:
    iif( .f., symbol, .t. )
which is eliminated before the variable is marked as used so I had
to make the trick with
    iif( !((.t.)), symbol, .t. )
what also will stop to work when we fix stripping parenthesis in
expression optimizer.

Well, I was testing with last week's CVS which did generate code,
now I did a checkout a retested, and it indeed didn't generate any
this time. Nice :)

Thanks for the solution, if we can make it even simpler, the better,
but I think (for me) this solves the problem perfectly.

I will change HB_SYMBOL_UNUSED() according to your mail.

Brgds,
Viktor

Probably yes. Though maybe someone can look at reported ISPRINTER()
problem. I do not use Windows and for sure I'll do not plan to make
anything with it myself.
Also maybe some of fixes from devel branch should be moved to BETA1.
Line numbering is not fixed in BETA1 code. Would you like to move this
fix from devel branch or we should leave it as is.

If it's a bug and we have the fix, then we should apply it.

We only need to avoid new concepts.

Hi all,

Anyone else experiencing not to receive his own
mails sent to the list?

The corresponding setting on the list admin page
is set to "Yes", which should be OK.

I believe this has something to do with the fact
that my mailbox is handled by google mail, but
there is no sign of getting back my messages at
all, not even in the spam folder.

Any ideas?

I suspect this is a problem with the interaction of mailman and
gmail (possibly other providers, too), and there seems to be
a solution for it in mailman 2.1.7. Harbour mailing list uses
2.1.5 (dec 2005), latest stable version is 2.1.9

Here is more detailed description of the problem:
http://www.moundalexis.com/tm/2007/01/28/gmail-beta-delivery-problem- 
exposed/

The conclusion is different, but mailman upgrade would
be worth the try anyways since we don't know the version
they're using for testing.

(BTW there is another list I use with the same problem,
also using 2.1.5, unfortunately I'm not on any list with
version 2.1.7 or above)

Brgds,
Viktor

Subject: [Harbour] Clipper's PCODE
Message-ID: <45DDD7FA.4010505@dbtopas.lt>

Hello,


I've read a message on the newsgroup about .F. .OR. 1, and tried to look 
at the Harbour's and Clipper's PCODE. I found obj2cc utility, I've wrote 
long time ago. I was hacking on Clipper internals a lot in the past.
I'm not sure, if it is useful for anyone any more, but if someone find 
it useful, you can download it from 
http://www.dbtopas.lt/download/clipper/obj2cc.zip

This zip contains dos executable compiled many years ago, test sample 
and source (dated 1997-01-25)! :) I've tried to compile it today for 
Win32 console, it works!

It is not a clipper sourcer, rather PCODE analyser. Input is clipper's 
.obj file, output .cc file (I didn't know word PCODE 10 years ago, so 
I've been calling it Clipper Code (CC)).


Best regards,
Mindaugas


P.S. here is a sample, to make imagine how it works:

----- test.prg ----
PROC main()
LOCAL nI

   Say( "Hello" )

   FOR nI := 1 TO 5
     Say( STR( nI ) )
   NEXT
RETURN

FUNC Say( cMsg )
   ? cMsg
RETURN NIL

Hello,


it depends on hacker :)

It's possible to hack (crack to be precise) .exe (look for Valkyrie, 
Rescue utility), but it's also possible to make .exe unhackable for some 
utility. Hacking usually is a question of time. The question is how much 
you can spend.

But this utility is not for hacking (cracking), but for hacking 
(analysing internals).


Best regards,
Mindaugas

Hi



> (analysing internals).

Yeah , that is the idea.
 I am looking for information of like doing it.
 I have both utilities , valkyrie and Rescue5 , i want to know how
these program works.
 I nedd to recreate PCODE ( for analysing and simulation )
 any advice who lays to me for the correct direction will be thanked for.

Hi Antonio,

Yeah I was wondering if there is anyone else with gmail accounts,
but I didn't realize yours was the same case, but it's now clear.

So far there can be two explanations for the problem:
1) gmail is thinking you already have this mail by looking into
      some header info (ID?), and sliently discarding it as a duplicate.
     (can happen as it stores the sent e-mails too)
2) Some grave problems are happening regarding the mail
      headers which makes gmail think, that the mail is forged
      or otherwise invalid. (I would guess it would put it into
      the spam folder, but who knows)
      The newer mailman fixes headers, so there is a chance.

Let's hope it will resolve, until then we have to look into the
outbox to see our mails. Or there can be a rule defined
to move the mails from sent items to the Harbour folder.
(this doesn't work in Mail.app and OE unfortunately, and for
any external sender apps like BLAT, which I use for sending
CHANGELOGs)

Brgds,
Viktor

Wow!!!. Really interesting tool. I think that I will find it _VERY_
useful. I have to honestly say that so far I was to lazy to try to
decompile Clipper PCODE manually and now I have very nice tool.
It's time to verify some things I was guessing so far making simple
tests by seeing real PCODE. The example from the message on xHarbour
news shows that when I was looking at doc/vm.txt I guessed correctly
what JTPF does (Jump if True or Pop False) ;-) - nice opcode for lazy
evaluation of logical expressions. Seems that I will have to look for
examples I collected in the past which were breaking Clipper VMs and
check what was wrong in generated PCODE.

Many thanks for it - I will have very nice toy for the nearest spare
time ;-)

BTW if you plan to make this code more portable then you should not
use functions like fgetw() or fgetpos()

I haven't touched this source for 10 years. It compiles for Win32, but 
I'm not sure if 32bit version .exe works OK, because I had an idea that 
int size is 16bit that time. So, I've put old 16bit DOS .exe into .zip, 
not the new one.
I'm not going to making it portable. But may be I'll re-think, if this 
tool will have such a success :) Anyway, feel free to modify source and 
use it as you wish :)

I know the messages are being sent out, so you really should take it up with 
google.com. I'll do what I can, but I can't fix google's spam setup.

With that said, is there a white list for your google.com email accounts? Have 
you contacted them to see what is happening with the messages?

I know the spam problem is bad because I deal with it every day, so I'm not 
blaming them for being aggressive. They have to be, but everyone who is not 
using gmail is getting their metoo's, so it would probably be more fruitful 
to ask google.com what is going on before we spend a lot of time on other 
remedies.

Przemek:

Now my messages to Harbour mailing list are accepted, but to your mail address are rejected, as shown below


See message about "new" error:

-------------------------
I tested with devel branch and yes, it fix case 2 (line numbering)

.. but I "new" error raised, which was hidden with line numbering error

Error is due to this code, which cause line numbering showed (8-1)=7
units lower than real number line

.... continue in message body

I compiled the code you sent and my results with current Harbour
devel version and Clipper are exactly the same:

hello         14
hello 1         62         62
Error BASE/1003  Variable does not exist: FIVE
Called from MAIN(65)

This modification:

2007-02-22 08:40 UTC+0100 Przemyslaw Czerpak (druzus/at/priv.onet.pl)
    * optimized PCODEs generated for FOR/NEXT code and removed some old
      hardcoded optimization for local variables - if it will be worth
      to optimize then such optimization will be done by expression
      optimizer

also fixed a problem with line numbering in FOR/NEXT and I guess you
made test before it was committed. Please check with current CVS and
if you will find any problems please inform me.

I made some quick and a little bit dirty modifications but now it nicely
works in my Linux box though it needs little endian machine without
strict alignment but it's not a problem x86 based computers.
Many thanks for the code.

Thanks for confirmation, AFAIK with BETA1 branch it should also
be OK now.

Some weeks ago I tried to build Harbour beta1 under OS/2, and it show 
many errors:
--------------------------------------
[Harbour] beta 0.99.1 in OS/2
Sat Jan 27 19:09:49 EST 2007
--------------------------------------


Now I tried to build current Harbour devel branch under OS/2
Errors are similar to those seen in beta1

For example:
--------------------------------------
make[3]: *** [harboury.c] Error 1
make[2]: *** [descend] Error 2
...
make[3]: ../../../../source/compiler/os2/gcc/harbour.exe: Command not found
--------------------------------------


Reviewing make_gnu.log I see some causes of errors

This error:
--------------------------------------
make[3]: *** [harboury.c] Error 1
make[2]: *** [descend] Error 2
--------------------------------------

is raised by:
--------------------------------------
make[3]: Entering directory `/hbbuild/harbour/source/compiler/os2/gcc'
copy ../../harbour.yyc harboury.c
SYS1003: The syntax of the command is incorrect.
--------------------------------------

in OS/2 this does not work:
     copy ../../harbour.yyc harboury.c
and this work:
     copy ..\..\harbour.yyc harboury.c

Difference is dir separator

Same happen for:
--------------------------------------
make[3]: Entering directory `/hbbuild/harbour/source/macro/os2/gcc'
copy ../../macro.yyc macroy.c
SYS1003: The syntax of the command is incorrect.
--------------------------------------


How can be resolved ?

Gracias,
David Macias

Could you try to SET DIRSEP=\
before you start the build (maybe in your make_gnu.cmd), and see if
it helps.

This problem can be reduced to such small sample:

    ? :subCode

Clipper's PP does not allow to start any expression with ":".
Compare .ppo files for this code from Harbour and Clipper.
Unfortunately in [x]Harbour WITH OBJECT statement uses ":"
as object identifier so if I'll make PP Clipper compatible
then this code will stop to work:

    WITH OBJECT errorNew()
	? :subCode
    END

It's not the only one problem caused by WITH OBJECT syntax :-(

In this case the problem is even bigger. Probably in the past no one noticed
that in Clipper's PP marker expressions cannot start with ":" and this
behavior was not replicated in old PP and translation from :: to SELF:
was added to lexers instead of hbclass.ch.
Try to preprocess by Clipper and Harbour or xHarbour this code:
    proc main()
    local self := errorNew()
        ? ::osCode
    return
and compare generated .ppo files - you will see what happens.
In last years lot of code was created for Harbour and xHarbour which
expects such wrong behavior and I'm afraid that now I cannot fix it.
I can only try to "hide" the problem for some chosen cases just like
I already added a hack to lexer for code like:
   proc main()
   local case:=errorNew()
   with object case
      do case
         case :osCode = 1
            case:osCode = 0
         case :osCode = 0
            case:osCode = 1
      endcase
      ? case:osCode
   end
   return

I had to add dirty hack and count number of spaces before ':' character
to recognize when:
   case :osCode = 0
is a case condition or assignment like in:
   case:osCode = 0

Bad but I had no choice. Now I can make sth like that for PP.
It's enough to change HB_PP_TOKEN_NEEDLEFT() macro in hbpp.h.
Now it's:

   #define HB_PP_TOKEN_NEEDLEFT(t)  \
      ( HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_ASSIGN || \
        HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_PLUSEQ || \
        HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_MINUSEQ || \
        HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_MULTEQ || \
        HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_DIVEQ || \
        HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_MODEQ || \

        HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_EQUAL || \
        HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_EQ )

and we can change it to:

   #define HB_PP_TOKEN_NEEDLEFT(t)  \
      ( HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_ASSIGN || \
        HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_PLUSEQ || \
        HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_MINUSEQ || \
        HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_MULTEQ || \
        HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_DIVEQ || \
        HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_MODEQ || \
        HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_EXPEQ || \
        HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_EQUAL || \
        HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_EQ || \
        ( HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_SEND && \
          (t)->spaces == 0 && (t)->pNext && \
          ( HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->pNext->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_KEYWORD || \
            HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->pNext->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_MACROVAR || \
            HB_PP_TOKEN_TYPE((t)->pNext->type) == HB_PP_TOKEN_MACROTEXT ) ) )

It will "fix" your code and many others but not all possible cases.
If you have other opinions then please let me know them.

Hi all.
I've added my personal ERRORSYS.prg that contain a call to my DefError
function:
<cut>
proc ErrorSys()
     ALERT("PERSONAL ERRORSYS")
     lError:= ErrorBlock( {|e| DefError(e)} )
return
</cut>

In Clipper application it must show the messagebox at startup.
How to in xHarbour?

(it's possible debug with xHarbour? I've the problem that I cant stop
application at error to see wich code row raise error)

Thank you very much.

Max

It's the same. This is a working sample:

FUNCTION MAIN()

    ? "Test3"

    INKEY( 0 )

    RETURN NIL


PROCEDURE ERRORSYS()

    SETMODE( 25, 80 )

    ? "Test"

    ALERT( "Test2" )

    RETURN

Yes, the debugger should be perfectly working. Try to compile with /b and link 
debug.lib.

I see that using Borland c++ 5.5 I create exe that does not run on
WindowsVista64Bit.
Can you suggest me the easy free C++ compiler/linker for 64bit OS?

Need I to re-compile all xHarbour library source in 64bit? (and contrib.
library)

Thank you very much.

Now I think it is.
We can wait day or two and if nothing new will appear we can
create BETA2 tag and release new binaries.
