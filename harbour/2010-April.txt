Hi Viktor,

Here's the doc I found from a Clipper 5.3 Norton Guide.

Regards,
Mario

  @...GET LISTBOX
  Create a new list box Get object and display it to the screen
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Syntax

      @ <nTop>, <nLeft>, <nBottom>, <nRight>
         GET <nVar|cVar>
         LISTBOX <aList>
            [CAPTION<cCaption>]
            [MESSAGE <cMessage>]
            [WHEN <lPreExpression>]
            [VALID <lPostExpression>]
            [COLOR <cColorString>]
            [FOCUS <fblock>]
            [STATE <bBlock>]
            [DROPDOWN]
            [SCROLLBAR]
            [SEND <msg>]
            [GUISEND <guimsg>]
            [BITMAP <cBitmap>]

  Arguments

<nTop>, <nLeft>, <nBottom> and <nRight> specify the
      screen position for the list box and its caption.  Output which 
extends
      beyond the visible extent of the display is clipped and does not 
appear.

      GET <nVar|cVar> specifies the name of the variable associated with
      the GET.  Its value indicates which item (if any) in the list is
      selected.  A numeric value refers to the position in the list of the
      selected item.  A value of 0 indicates no selected item.  A character
      string value refers to the data or text contained within the selected
      item.  A character string that does not refer to any item in the list
      indicates no selected item.

      LISTBOX <aList> specifies an array that contains the items in the
      list.  The array may be either a single- or two-dimensional 
array.  Use
      a single-dimension array when the data being displayed is the same as
      the data being saved; otherwise, use a two-dimensional array.  In this
      case, the data in the first element of each subarray is displayed and
      the data in the second element is used for determining which item is
      selected.

      CAPTION <cCaption> specifies a character string that concisely
      describes the GET on the screen.  Caption differs from the SAY 
argument
      in two ways.  The first is that the caption is displayed each time the
      GET is shown on the screen.  The other difference is that the caption,
      along with its screen position, is maintained within the Get object.
      This allows the GET to receive input when the mouse's left button is
      clicked and its cursor is on the caption.  By default, the caption
      appears to the left of the GET.  Use the Get object's capRow or capCol
      variable to change the screen position of the caption.

      When present, the & character specifies that the character
      immediately following it in the caption is the list box's accelerator
      key. The accelerator key provides a quick and convenient mechanism for
      the user to move input focus from one data input control to the list
      box.  The user performs the selection by pressing the Alt key in
      combination with an accelerator key.  The case of an accelerator 
key is
      ignored.

      MESSAGE <cMessage> specifies a character string that is displayed on
      the Get system's status bar line when the GET has input focus.
      Typically, it describes the anticipated contents or user response 
of the
      GET.  Refer to the READ command for details pertaining to the Get
      system's status bar.

      WHEN <lPreExpression> specifies an expression that must be satisfied
      before the cursor can enter the GET during a READ.  The expression can
      optionally be a code block.  The Get object is passed as a 
parameter to
      the code block.

      VALID <lPostExpression> specifies an expression that must be
      satisfied before the cursor can leave the GET during a READ.  The
      expression can optionally be a code block.  The Get object is 
passed as
      a parameter to the code block.

      COLOR <cColorString> defines the color settings for the list box.
<cColorString> is a character expression containing exactly seven color
      settings if there is no drop-down list box, and eight if there is a
      drop-down list box.

      ListBox Color Attributes
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Position     Applies To                             Default Value from
      in colorSpec                                        System Color 
Setting
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
      1            List box items that are not selected     Unselected
                   when the list does not have input focus
      2            The selected list box item when the      Unselected
                   List does not have input focus
      3            List box items that are not selected     Unselected
                   when the list has input focus
      4            The selected list box item when the      Enhanced
                   list has input focus
      5            The list box's border                    Border
      6            The list box's caption                   Standard
      7            The list box caption's accelerator key   Background
      8            The list box's drop-down button          Standard
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Note:  In graphic mode, colorSpec position 8 has no affect and is
      ignored.

      FOCUS <fblock> specifies a code block that is evaluated each time
      the list box receives focus.  The code block takes no implicit
      arguments.  Use the PushButton:hasFocus instance variable to determine
      if the push button has focus.

      STATE <bBlock> specifies a code block that is evaluated immediately
      after the list box object's selection changes.  The code block 
takes no
      implicit arguments.  Use the ListBox:buffer instance variable to
      determine the current selection.

      DROPDOWN indicates that the list box will be a drop-down list box.
      Drop-down list boxes are displayed differently on the screen than
      regular list boxes.  A regular list box is always displayed regardless
      of whether it has input focus.  A drop-down list box's display 
behavior
      is determined by whether it is closed or open.  By default, a 
drop-down
      list box is closed.  In this case, only the caption, the selected 
item,
      and the open button are displayed.

      When open, the actual list box is displayed in addition to the 
caption,
      selected item, and open button.

      Drop-down list boxes are useful in situations where screen space is
      limited.

      SCROLLBAR indicates that the list box will be created with a scroll
      bar whether or not it is needed.  Normally a scroll bar is not 
needed if
      the data being displayed fits inside the list box.

      SEND <msg> sends the specified message to the Get object. <msg> is
      sent before the GET is displayed.  Any message can be sent, including
      method calls and instance variable assignments.  Method calls must
      include parentheses even if no arguments are passed.

      GUISEND <guimsg> can be used to send a message (such as the
      display() method) to a GUI object.  The GUI objects available in
      CA-Clipper are check boxes, list boxes, push buttons, and radio button
      groups.  To send a message to a non-GUI object, such as standard GETs
      and TBrowses, use the SEND clause.

      BITMAP <cBitmap> defines the bitmap that will be used as the down
      arrow on a drop-down list box.  Drive and directory names are not
      allowed; the file name extension is required.  A bitmap file can be
      stored as a file on disk or in a bitmap library.  If stored as a file,
      the file must reside in the same directory as the application.  If
      stored in a bitmap library, the library must reside in the same
      directory as the application and it also must have the same name 
as the
      application with a .bml extension.

      CA-Clipper will search for the file name first and, if it is not 
found,
      search in the bitmap library second.  If no file is found either 
on disk
      or in the library, no bitmap will be displayed.

  Examples

      ?  This example demonstrates how to add a list box to a data
         entry screen.  It utilizes the position-oriented method of 
selection:

         nColor := 1     //default to the first item.
         @ 5, 20, 8, 28 GET nColor LISTBOX { "Red", Green", "Blue" }

      ?  This example demonstrates a list box that has a caption and a
         message.  It utilizes the data-oriented method of selection:

         cColor := "Red" //default to red.
         @ 5, 20, 8, 28 GET cColor LISTBOX { "Red", Green", "Blue" };
                 CAPTION "&Color" ;
                 MESSAGE "Select the background color"

      ?  This example demonstrates a list box that utilizes a two-
         dimensional array.

         cState := "NY"

         @ 5, 20, 10, 30 GET cState LISTBOX { { "Alabama", "AL" }, ;
                                      { "Alaska", AK" }   , ;
                                      { "Arizona", "AZ" }, ;
                                      { etc...          } } ;
                 CAPTION "&State" ;
                 MESSAGE "Select the client's state"

Victor, thanks for the dosemu hints for Linux: my old Clipper is 5.2e so i
cannot confirm your verify request.

Seems hardly to find here someone that have the Clipper 5.3 to test the code
:-(

Best regards,
Marco

Bruno,

gtwvw (i never used it) is under the harbour/examples/gtwvw

hbct: compatible functions and procedures with Clipper Tools for
CA-Clipper, is a contrib library under harbour/contrib/hbct
http://www.harbour-project.org/download_contrib.html

to get this lib compiled on your Linux when you upgrade from svn simply add
the lib name to the exported var HB_CONTRIBLIBS:

export HB_CONTRIBLIBS="other_already_included_libs hbct"

This is Harbour src/rdd/dbf1.c code which control this:

   #ifdef HB_CLP_STRICT
      /* this is for strict Clipper compatibility but IMHO Clipper should not
         do that and always set fixed size independent to the record number */
      if( ulRecNo < 10000000 )
      {
         hb_itemPutNLLen( pRecNo, ulRecNo, 7 );
      }
      else
      {
         hb_itemPutNLLen( pRecNo, ulRecNo, 10 );
      }
   #else
      hb_itemPutNInt( pRecNo, ulRecNo );
   #endif

As you can see in Clipper the default number of formatting digits depends
on record number. Such behavior causes serious problems in some cases, i.e.
in index like yours it reduces maximum table size to 9999999 records (over
this limit last 3 digits from index key are lost) so I decided to "fix" it
and left above note in source code.

Yes. It's enough to set explicitly number of digits though I suggest to
use 10 instead of 7 if you do not want to introduce some limits for
maximum number of records.

BTW if you do not need to access the indexes by Clipper then you can
reach the same effect much easier.
   rddInfo( RDDI_SORTRECNO, .t., "DBFNTX" )
enables Harbour extension which causes that in newly created indexes
RECNO() is calculate as hidden trailing part of the key just like in
CDX or NSX so it gives effectively the same without adding any STR(RECNO())
to index key and without increasing the index size. It also eliminates
potentially big performance problem caused by linear scan in NTX indexes
using a lot of non unique keys when they have to be positioned after
GOTO or for update.
You can also use:
   rddInfo( RDDI_MULTITAG, .t., "DBFNTX" )
to enable support for multitag NTX indexes - many indexes (tags) in
single file like in CDX or NSX formats.

> I will then recreate all indexes to solve my corruption problem.

Yes it is and user should remember about it.
BTW many clipper/xbase compatible languages use different number of
default digits in recno item so you should always try to use explicit
size of in str(recno()) expression if you want to share indexes or
use some RDBMS for DBFs.

The problem is that you haven't testewd your example in Clipper.
It works in excatly the same way as in Harbour.

Not "instead".
This are two different things.
   SET( _SET_CODEPAGE, <cCPID> )
choose codepage mdoule for character encoding and sorting and
   SET( _SET_LANG, <cLANGID> )
choose langue module with natinal strings so you have to use both,
i.e.:

   PROC MAIN()
      LOCAL i
      REQUEST HB_CODEPAGE_UA866
      REQUEST HB_LANG_UA866
      SET( _SET_CODEPAGE, "UA866" )
      SET( _SET_LANGUAGE, "UA866" )
      ? "LANG:", hb_langName()
      ? "CP:", hb_cdpInfo()
      FOR i := 1 TO 12
         ? CMonth( SToD( "2010" + strzero( i, 2 ) + "01" ) )
      NEXT
   RETURN

HB_CDPSELECT() is the same as SET( _SET_CODEPAGE ) and
HB_LANGSELECT() is the same as SET( _SET_LANGUAGE )

BTW do not share indexes with xHarbour application using Ukrainian
CPs. In xHarbour codepage module is broken and for some languages
like Ukrainian it uses corrupted collation order.

For some GTs you should also use:
   HB_SETTERMCP( "UA866" )
to inform them about character encoding in string buffer.
This requirement will be removed in UNICODE builds in the future
when we switch internal screen buffer to operate on UNICODE values.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64
"Instead of FS segment descriptor on x86 versions of the Windows NT 
family, GS segment descriptor is used to point to two operating system 
defined structures: Thread Information Block (NT_TIB) in user mode and 
Processor Control Region (KPCR) in kernel mode. Thus, for example, in 
user mode GS:0 is the address of the first member of the Thread 
Information Block. Maintaining this convention made the x86-64 port 
easier, but required AMD to retain the function of the FS and GS 
segments in long mode ? even though segmented addressing per se is not 
really used by any modern operating system"

Send me some MSVC samples, that accesses TLS, because I do not have this 
compiler.

This variable has been used since long, but was only recently 
used to differentiate between msvc 2008 and 2010.

[ If msvs 2010 won't be available in free edition, I will 
delete such special support for it. ]

Surest is to use autodetection.

Wrong order. If you call HB_SETTERMCP() before _SET_CODEPAGE then
you have to use:
   HB_SETTERMCP( "UA866", "UA866" )

The general syntax is:
   HB_SETTERMCP( <cTermCP>, [<cHostCP>], [<lBox>] )
You can use it also in none unicode GTs like GTSTD to translate between
CPs, i.e.:
   HB_SETTERMCP( "UA1125", "UA866" )

Thanks Viktor,

I found the revision that breaks it. 14221.

 > Use 'export HB_INSTALL_PREFIX={hb_top}'

Sorry but I will need a little more guidance here :-(

Do you mean to use in normal make / make install? :-
$ export HB_INSTALL_PREFIX={hb_top}
$ make
# make install

What does HB_INSTALL_PREFIX={hb_top} change?

Barry

Hello Przemek,

Thank-you very much for the detailed explanation and the additional most
helpful information.
At this time I need to co-exist with pure Cl*pper files and indexes, but
once I get all systems converted to Harbour, I will look at improved
functionality. When the time comes, your suggestions for rddInfo(
RDDI_SORTRECNO, .t., "DBFNTX" ) and rddInfo( RDDI_MULTITAG, .t., "DBFNTX" )
are very interesting, or would it be better to convert all to FoxPro CDX?

Also I might suggest updating the Harbour documentation for the STR()
function which currently reads as:

STR() returns <nNumber> formatted as a character string. If the optional
length and decimal arguments are not specified, STR() returns the character
string according to the following rules: 
Results of STR() with No Optional Arguments 
	Expression Returns Value Length 
	Field Variable Field length plus decimals 
	Expressions/constants Minimum of 10 digits plus decimals 
	VAL() Minimum of 3 digits 
	MONTH()/DAY() 3 digits 
	YEAR() 5 digits 
	RECNO() 7 digits 


Thanks again and to ALL for the outstanding work,

Heinz Bergen

Hi,

The root of the issue is set WS_EX_LAYERED extended windows attribute.
I really like (i.e. for debug proposal) and tried to fix it.

It's difficult to do an example self-contained because it depends on many factors and windows in the background.
The issue happens on a application that only have screen output in Clipper code.
If being added the attribute WS_EX_COMPOSITED or removed WS_EX_LAYERED the issue disappears.
I changed the behavior of Caret "Cursor" as usual according to .-

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms648398%28VS.85%29.aspx

And added HB_TRACEs to see the behavior of the caret.
Note that, with the current code, try creating the caret without focus (window is the background) and always show caret if 
exist. All of this can affect in the tests.
Attached gtwvt.zip (gtwvt.h,gtwvt.c) with the changes, I think is better: please check.
Of course if I marking invalidate the previous cursor position the issue also disappears but I'm only masking them.

I would appreciate if someone could do a self-contained example, any help is welcome.
IMHO for now and to production proposals is better remack with #if 0 the establishment of WS_EX_LAYERED.

Best regards,
Xavi

Thank you for required change.

Can you show a small snippet how to inherit a new GT from 
existing GTWVT. Goal is to : GTWVG inherits GTWVT to avoid  redundancy.

Sorry, but this is not good solution. I'm using GTWVT
quite extensively on a number of different systems, but
yet I have no idea what sort of issue you are having. If it
bothers you, turn it off locally, but don't force it to all users
until we know exactly what it is (maybe local driver problem).

BTW there were a lot of screen painting irregularities without
WS_EX_LAYERED, when the window was behind another
window and foremost window was moved. It also fixes painting
issue when app is doing a loop, or otherwise unresponsive.

Brgds,
Viktor

Thanks but this is under control.
Remember that GTWVT is a pure Windows GUI and it need to process messages to refresh the screen. It does this with the outputs 
to screen and inputs from keyboard. In typical code like loops with pure RDDs you can force this with SetPos .-

nCursor := SetCursor( 0 )
WHILE !EOF()
   SetPos( 0, 0 )
   ...
   SKIP()
ENDDO
SetCursor( nCursor )

Of course it supports many optimizations.
if( ++n % 10000 == 0 ); SetPos( 0, 0 ); endif

Xavi

Sorry, ... and I think that is not even necessary because the VM does calling hb_inkeyPoll :)

I try to avoid such hacks in high-level code 
if possible, though in most places there is 
a gauge visible in these operations. Plus, there 
are cases when this cannot work at all: f.e. 
when launching another process and waiting for 
it to complete, or another extreme example when 
app crashes / hangs. EX_LAYERED will keep a 
buffer of the screen, which gives better 
performance for screen refreshes, and it also 
makes the app behave/look smoother. Regardless 
I think it's not the job of high-level code 
to ensure screen refresh.

BTW, even with this I can see artifacts with 
GTWVT, f.e. visible pixel-wide vertical lines 
between full-block characters. Much worse is 
GTWIN, where complete pixels are missing/left 
on screen and which are Windows problems.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi,

This seems like mingw distro bug. You can try to work it around
by making sure gcc.exe also exists next to the -dw2 version.
I think normally it should be there though.

Or try using official distro if you absolutely need dw2.

Anyway it's not Harbour problem.

Brgds,
Viktor

I'll try to add to GTWVT support for some GUI objects containers.
They will not be used by GTWVT directly but should greatly help to
write upper level GTs which will inherit from GTWVT adding real code
for windows GUI elements. It should help to eliminate repeated code
from GTWVG be enabling simple inheritance from GTWVT and also write
new GTWVW replacement.

Now I'm still very busy so I do not have time to make any bigger
modifications in Harbour core code or even answer to many massages
addressed for me (sorry to all that I'm ignoring them) and I only
make few minutes breaks in a day writing some messages or committing
some very simple modifications but there is big chance that in this
month I'll finish my most important business projects and in next
month I'll find more time for Harbour.

best regards,
Przemek

Ok, you are correct (as always :-) ) the problem is in the windres
executable that has a reference to gcc...

Mingw version is from tdm-mingw-1.908.0-4.4.1-2.exe

I solved with a simple copy gcc-dw2.exe gcc.exe

It worked on harbour 2.0 but since then .rc file was added for the
icon and so this problem compared...

thank you,
Francesco

That will be really great.
Off late I got so involved with hbQT+ that I could not 
catch up with GTWVT changes to GTWVG. Yesterday I tried but 
realized that it needs much more effort than I thought.

It is understandable. Take your own time. No hurry.

That now works fine - nice.

However the edit window tab labels are still the same in Linux.

It is difficult for me to fix it as I do not have linux setup.
Can you play with following lines in idestylesheet.prg:

      aadd( txt_, '    border: 2px solid #94C4C3;                                              
' )
      aadd( txt_, '    border-bottom-color: #C2C7CB; /* same as the pane
color */               ' )
      aadd( txt_, '    border-top-left-radius: 6px;                                            
' )
      aadd( txt_, '    border-top-right-radius: 6px;                                           
' )
      aadd( txt_, '    min-width: 8px;                                                         
' )
      aadd( txt_, '    padding: 2px;                                                           
' )

Try to change *px values and do some experiments.
And please report back what values are right for linux.

Yes.

It will install Harbour binaries into the source tree. Add
'bin' dir to the PATH or just call hbmk2 directly and
you're done.

OK it's sorted.
The problem was the KDE style for widgets I had selected in the desktop 
environment.
There are several available :-
CDE
Cleanlooks
GTK+
LaOra-KDE   <==
LaOra-Qt
Motif
Oxygen      <==
Plastique
Windows

There are only two that are bad for HBIDE (<==). I was using Oxygen !

I have switched to LaOra-Qt and it's fine.
http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n287/barjac_2006/hbide3.png

The bad styles also shrink the text boxes in the Tools & Utils dialogue.

Changing the *px values did not affect the text at all, just the tab 
size/borders etc.

So that's one less TODO for you! :-)

Rgds,
Barry

Subject: [Harbour] hbQT - GC - And the Solution
Message-ID: <1270337236166-4848688.post@n2.nabble.com>


Hello Everybody

Since yesterday I am busy with intensive experiments 
applying various combinations of the hbQT destructor code
and GC and have come out with following :

Link hbIDE ( any other application as well ) with -hbnocppmm as
c:\>hbmk2 hbide.hbp -hbnocppmm and GPF's will disappear.

The reason is: as we cannot handle how and when Qt applies 
destructions in an object's life-cycle, we must not allocate those 
pointers via our own memory managers. But still we need to inform
Qt that an object is no longer in use if variable holding it 
goes out of scope.

Other all aspects are still the same minus GPF.
Please test on various OS's/Systems and report on the list.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Quite strange conclusion. QT should work no matter
what sort of memory allocation subsystem we use, so
I assume this is wrong conclusion and just some luck
on your part not getting errors with default allocator in
your specific tests.

Please note that we had tons of similar problems
(heavy GPFs and leaks) even before introducing memory
allocator override. In fact our own memory allocator
was the tool to reveal some of the grave problems,
which were just hidden before.

So IMO this advice is nothing more than a new
dead road "towards" the solution. IMO there is no
"magic", "one click" solution to this problem, but
only to do the hard work, understanding the details
of QT object handling and fixing the problems for real.

IOW: hiding the problems won't solve the problems.

Brgds,
Viktor

Thank you very much for the hints Viktor and have a nice day.

It's not a local problem of drivers because I can reproduce it on different hardware/drives under Windows XP, also in 
VirtualBox. It's easy to reproduce in the application that I'm moving to Harbour and in Clipper, under NTVDM, does not happen.
Only enter in MemoEdit, move to the end, exit (this memorize positions and text) and re-enter, move the cursor up and I've the 
mark of the previous cursor. [Remember that this is few tested, I've fix recently MemoEdit's page movements, before it broke the 
screen.] It also does with some GETs to close the window press Esc but it depends on what is presented.
It's not easy to reproduce in a self-contained example because it uses a sophisticated system of windows (Save/RestScreen) 
written in pure Clipper. I can not simplify it, i.e. presents the positions and scroll bars operational.

I like to use EX_LAYERED but I think is an issue in Windows XP on Caret refresher and the buffer.
Only found this but is very different .-

http://plainwonders.blogspot.com/2007/09/whats-wrong-with-wsexlayered-and.html

I've made many tests to fix it but the only effective solution is invalidate the previous cursor position.
Attached the changes to the current code, I would commit.
Please note that most positions (normal use) are already invalidated and is affected by SetCursor(0).
The code is activated with EX_LAYERED by define initial.

Best regards and Happy Easter to All!

Hi Xavi,

I don't understand this patch, it's against an older version
of the files (missing my last minor update), you added
conditional code for layered mode (why?) and you still try
to force your setcancel hack. It also employs trick to track
focus, and I'm not sure I like it.

IMO the issue to be resolved doesn't justify any sort
of irregular tricks or any chance for performance drop down.

Pls consult with Przemek about it.

Brgds,
Viktor

In the "compiler environments" dialog, the path to hbmk2 file browser

An attempt to enter *.* in the file name box causes a RTE.

This observation is false.
Probably the side effect of some over-do in the experimental
phase. It poses more problems than solutions.
So -nohbcppmm is a bad option.

These two operators are reached, though:

   void * operator new( size_t nSize )
   {
      if( nSize == 0 )
      {
         nSize = 1;
      }
      return = hb_xgrab( nSize );
   }

   void operator delete( void * ptr )
   {
      if( ptr )
      {
         hb_xfree( ptr );
         ptr = 0;
      }
   }

Hi Viktor,

Me neither, I guess that Tortoise always makes the patch with the latest version... I correct it manually, no problem.
Maybe it's better to do all the changes in the repository or don't change any in a file under discussion. I don't know.

Conditional compiler time code with layered mode is to link the two issues.
Use layered model by the buffer like a opaque window when is not opaque until remove the attribute.
It's also faster without WS_EX_LAYERED and simple not have to check if exist WS_EX_LAYERED and not exit WS_EX_COMPOSITED.

I want to record in the code, in the form of a conditional compiler time, the option.
It's not a whim. I've help and moved many codes Clipper to Harbour. I don't know what answer when asked to why left the 
execution of a code-protected by SetCancel(.F.)/SetCancel(.T.) when clicked [X] on title windows bar. I say that use SET 
CLOSABLE OFF new in Harbour but they say it's too easy to forget and the codes are already written. Then I think why not say so 
in public devel-list but... I also think it is better to keep quiet because it's my job. :(

UpdateCaret try create caret when is in the background, I like to keep clean Windows LastError whenever possible and easy. In 
problems like this can be important. Trick to track focus allow this, can also be interesting to know this condition.

I agree and I think, of course, don't do this.

Seems not to be fixed yet.
The skeleton has changed to *.* but no files are visible in the folder.
In the screenshot see the same folder as seen by Dolphin file manager.

Pritpal,
After more testing it seems that *.* will only display files with an 
extension - not sure but I guess that * would be needed for files 
without any to be displayed.
Unlike Windows lots of files in Linux have no extensions as the file 
type is detected from the file header.
I just added test.txt to that folder and it is displayed OK.
The same applies to the other instances of the qt file browser/selector 
widget that you are using.
Rgds,
Barry

The best is to send .diffs against latest source tree:
   svn update
   svn diff > patch.dif
   (and .zip it or paste it if it's only for review and short)

Please don't add new knobs, I'm working hard to remove them, 
and for the sake of maintainability and to avoid unnecessary 
build-types, such built-time knobs are not welcome in the code.

I don't know what answer when asked to why left the execution of a code-protected by SetCancel(.F.)/SetCancel(.T.) when clicked [X] on title windows bar. I say that use SET CLOSABLE OFF new in Harbour but they say it's too easy to forget and the codes are already written. Then I think why not say so in public devel-list but... I also think it is better to keep quiet because it's my job. :(

I find it rather offensive/disturbing that you keep posting 
this piece of code for the 5th time, while it's clearly 
against concept and project goals and you can't address 
any of the concerns I raised here several times (and which 
I won't repeat this time). Moreover it doesn't bring anything 
new to Harbour, just limits current features by tying to 
different settings into one.

In my view the SVN should contain stuff which is useful 
for most users, and stuff which we've agreed upon, and not 
support for special personal needs or undiscussed (rogue) 
changes at will. If you don't agree with this and/or with 
major directions of development, it's best to keep a local 
patch on your system (and optionally publish these patches 
and binaries for interested users, if there are any). This 
is one of the advantages of open source.

Brgds,
Viktor

So it means I have to remove all occurances of selecting a file 
based on the file type. Hmm, I need to know what is balancing 
mask for both systems. Can you help ?

Yes Przemek you're right I've never tested this with Clipper 5.3 :).  
Should we make it compatible to Clipper 5.3 behavior to not process the 
VALID code block although it contradicts what was stated in the 
documentation?

There is also a display bug here, which I hope someone can verify.

No. It means you have to use '*' as 'all files' mask for *nix
systems. BTW '*' works on Windows as well. Best is to
add a little function which returns 'all files' mask according
to __PLATFORM__* macro. (pbly OS/2 still requires '*.*', but
someone should confirm this)

Should make no difference. The line drawing chars are
drawn using double width chars, hence the visual artifact.
I guess this is due to some sort of (far-east/dbcs?) encoding
related problem inside Harbour code.

Hi
Thanks to test code.
I uninstall/reinstall mouse driver and also test on another PC with windows
an get same result.

When roll whell mouse buttons: MRow() and MCol() return
apsolutly position from desktop (not app window)
but with other keys (left, right, middle) click, all is OK
Also when I roll whell button (forward or backward) outside
app window Row() & Col() position is updated with desktop row & col.

Tested also witg WVG and console window.
On full screen Whell event is ignred

Is this normal or.... ?
I port my 15 year old application from Clipper 52e + SIX 3.0 to Harbour
and include mouse events.
My idea is: step up/down Date, Number...etc... with whell button when is 
cursor ower
get object, but I do not get correct coorinates.

Sorry for my bad english explanation :(

Hi,

Wheel actions spit out keyboard events. They don't
modify mouse coordinates (mrow/mcol) if that's what
you mean or expect.

Sorry... ???
This does the same that GTWVT so the same code has the same behavior in both.

False. In GTWVT it will only do it if callback says to do so,
and it instantly exists the application (that's why it modifies
this flag internally - I guess).

In GTWIN, it just sets the SETCANCEL flag and lets the
app continue to run.

Overall I don't see what did you solve, and your ChangeLog
entry doesn't help at all to find it out: "Fixed CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT
according to present project goals" simply means nothing.
Pls describe what you did and why, such meaningless plugs
don't help the case.

Message-ID: <001701cad55b$be3a1c20$3aae5460$@com.au>

Hi,

Clipper code is 5.2 and uses RDD DBFCDX for access to dbf files (IDX index
suffix)

Known extensions used: inkey, grump, grumpm, funcky and postscpt (Postscript
extrasensory.com)

Steps completed:

1. compiled existing Clipper code and linked to an .exe to run on Vista and
32/64 bit machines
   - used: hbmk2 ausway.prg
   - executable creates CDX not IDX as per Clipper (not an issue)
   - due to third party code, I needed to rewrite approx. 20
functions/routines (mainly GRUMPFISH), not sure if there is a 
     List of routines written by developers?

2. as above but used MS Visual Studio v9.0 C++ to compile C code to produce
a Windows executable
   - used: harbour ausway.prg -kc -gc
   - ausway.c has the following header, I wanted an msvc env (see below), is
this correct?
   - is the script too verbose and/or is there a better way to achieve the
desired result?
   - response from extrasensory.com re: Harbour compatibility
     	Do you use the ps_J functions? (YES) If you don't use the
justification engine, 
     	I could easily port it or likely just compile the code in Harbour,
     	if it uses the justify engine, it's out of my league to port.

I wouldn't recommend using C compiler directly.

As for MSVC configuration look into INSTALL (or MS docs),
most of above Harbour related configuration is unnecessary.

Try with something like:
---
CALL "C:\PROGRAM FILES\MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO 9.0\VC\BIN\VCVARS32.BAT"
C:\HB20\BIN\hbmk2 ausway.prg

GTWVT do this without callback, you need to program a express callback to not do so return 1 i.e.
if not exist NotifierBlock "callback" hb_gt_wvt_FireEvent return 0 and do so.

static int hb_gt_wvt_FireEvent( PHB_GTWVT pWVT, int nEvent )
{
    int nResult = 0; /* Unhandled */

    if( pWVT->pGT->pNotifierBlock )
    {
	...
    }

    return nResult;
}
...
       case WM_CLOSE:  /* Clicked 'X' on system menu */
          if( hb_gt_wvt_FireEvent( pWVT, HB_GTE_CLOSE ) == 0 )
          {
             PHB_ITEM pItem = hb_itemPutL( NULL, HB_TRUE );
             hb_setSetItem( HB_SET_CANCEL, pItem );...
...

This is what I tried to say and do many times.

Could you explain what must be the behavior for both?
I've no objection to change.

This is wrong solution. SETCANCEL is not something
the app sets. SETCANCEL is a way to let app developers
_control_ the behavior of Ctrl+C. Nothing more. What you
committed just creates a hidden extension plus incompatible
to Clipper behavior (since in Clipper SETCANCEL flag was
never modified by window closure).

Hi,


you error screen shows the reason of error. SDDODBC/1906 means statement 
allocation error. Your sample generates error on dbusearea(), but does 
not generates error on RDDINFO(RDDI_EXECUTE,), though both actions do 
statement allocation. Current code uses mixed statement allocation:
   SQLAllocStmt() in RDDI_EXECUTE
and
   SQLAllocHandle( SQL_HANDLE_STMT, )  in DBUSEAREA()

Microsoft says: "In ODBC 3.x, the ODBC 2.x function SQLAllocStmt  has 
been replaced by SQLAllocHandle."

Can you test sddodbc.c, by changing line #339 from
    if ( ! SQL_SUCCEEDED( SQLAllocHandle( SQL_HANDLE_STMT, 
pSDDConn->hConn, &hStmt ) ) )
to
    if ( ! SQL_SUCCEEDED( SQLAllocStmt( pSDDConn->hConn, &hStmt ) ) )
?

If this helps, we will need some additional compile switches to use 
different ODBC API version.



Regards,
Mindaugas

Hi Mindaugas,

I donot know why ?  Now the error gone ...
http://www.mingyik.com/dnload/tstodbc30.jpg

However,  I have download and install the mysql-connector-c-6.0.2-win32.msi  
during testing SSDMY (although the testing on SDDMY fail as well)

Once see your message, I recompile my testing program again ....
The exec. it ....Now problem gone !??

Subject: [Harbour] Introducing myself
Message-ID: <r2tc1d721e41004060808mdf759536hba6a94edeb1fe9@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody

First of all I really sorry by my bad and poor English. I made my best.

I am a software developer for 26 years working with several programming
languages mostly building Line Of Business applications in Brazil.

I worked with Clipper since Clipper exists. I used the first copy sold in
Brazil by Softcorp (succeeded by Officer and after Nantucket Brasil and CA
Brasil). I worked on a company (one of the major business software companies
in the world) that was practically the only VO beta tester in Brazil. It's a
shame a good idea turns trash :-) As 1996 on internet era I change my career
and dropped Clipper in favor of other solutions. Now I am back to LOB
applications with total freedom to choose my way. I decided modernize my old
Clipper applications "porting" to Harbour. I was a big lover of Clipper,
specially 5.2 and I had supported the way Nantucket did think Clipper
evolution and some aspects of Visual Objects developed by CA. I liked to see
Clipper near to syntax and some semantics of C. Yes, I am not a typical
Clipper developer. I think dBase style is a bad thing although is
a necessary evil to carry.

I want fix some errors and bad style which I made on 80's and use improved
features available on Harbour.  I need rewrite my C functions, throw away
some, rethink about UI (console to GUI) and databases (transition from DBF
to MySQL and others RDBMS).

I think harbor 2.0 is a wonderful piece of software. It's not perfect
because the heavy legacy to honor. I like the design of a clean core with
extensions. I want publicly prize Viktor and PC (I can?t write his name :-)
). I agree with most of their decisions and I strongly appreciate their
work. Ok, now I can criticize some points without fear :-) I want to see
Harbour moving forward, not in xHarbour style, but in smart Harbour style.
In Brazil we have a popular expression: The hasty eating raw :-)

I want to make it clear: I want help Harbour development. Now I can mainly
give my opinions, try to influence some decisions, suggest enhancements,
report bugs. I need to get experience with C99 and GCC. My C experience is
about MS-C 5.0 (I give you a candy if you know why :-) ). I need to get time
to help with code. I will try to contribute with some thing later.

I can't help too much with documentation, IMHO the biggest Harbour
need, because my bad English. I am improving Wikipedia's article now. I
invite you to contribute too. It's an initial work. I will contribute more
on Portuguese article. I am writing about Harbour on a variety of articles
(xBase, programming languages comparison, etc). See my contribs logged as
bigown. Please, feel free to add new information or edit and delete wrong or
bad text. I am reviewing text bring from xHarbour. It's a good way to learn
more about Harbour. Viktor, I think now the article is very bad, but not a
shame anymore ;-)

In the next days I will try reply some old messages with my opinions.

I would like help with HBIDE but I have a very different programming style
and my major problem as developer is difficulty of adaptation on other
style. Totally my fault. Anyway I would like to see HBIDE  evolution mainly
in code editor and debugger. In fact I hope to get HBIDE compiled. Four days
trying and nothing :-) But I can't get any application using Qt or MySQL
compiled. Maybe my Harbour build is wrong. I still trying.

Well, I have to learn a lot about Harbour, try it on Linux and I hope PC
(druzus) can get some time to answer some doubts about PP. I have special
interest about it because I am thinking to write a transformation software
to change my legacy code. I love Clipper/Harbour PP and I abuse it, but I
know what I am doing.

Now I have a lot of work to do.

Thanks to everyone efforts. Harbour community need to be more active to
"sell" Harbour on the web. IMHO most xBase programmer is individualist too
much, including. I hope change this.

Feel free to write me in private when the list is not adequate place.

i agree  documentation, is  the biggest Harbour need, so i want invite
anybody to contribute,the steep are very easy using hbide.

H*ow read harbour documentation with hbide*
1 Point to <Docks> option on <Main Menu> and click on  <Document Viewer>
2 A right-side "Document Viewer" window will appear.
3 Provide Harbour's installation root path in  "Harbour Installation Root:"
field, i.e., C:\harbour
4 Click "Refresh" icon on the toolbar of "Document Viewer" window" only once
and wait a couple of seconds. "Contents" tab will be populated with /doc and
/doc/en  folders.
*How write harbour documentation with hbide*
1 Click on "Documentation Writer" icon on the right-toolbar,
2.  Open some source in the editor,
3.  Position cursor somewhere inside a function body,
4.  Click on "Load from current function" icon on the top-toolbar of
"Document Writer" widget,
5.  Look at the contents, few fields will be auto filled with various info
from current function
6.  Complete the other fields with relevent information,
7.1 Click on "Save the documentation with current function",
7.2 Look at the function body in the editor,The NANFORUM compliant
documentation
       will be inserted at the top of function's prototype.
8.1 Click on "Save written/updated documentation" icon,and provide the
filename to save ,
8.2 Copy such generated .txt in /harbour/doc/en,
8.3 Open "Harbour Document Viewer" and you should be viweing newly written
documentation
8.4 Such generated file is ready to be uploaded to SVN, just send it to the
list and group will decide if it needs something extra.

You are allright. I think very few of us are from native english speaking
areas.
Important is not the language, but the willingness to express.
Welcome on the list.

It is strange. If you have set Harbour environment properly,
which I guess you have, and Qt distro then it should be a matter of 
issueing only 
   c:\>hbmk2  hbide.hbp 
Let us know where you get the problems.

Yes. This is a pitty. Very few are vocal and respond on the lists.

G-Wan is a free very fast web server available for Windows/Linux.  It has the ability to run scripts
at specific times or intervals as well as being a socket server and web server.  Since it runs "C"
scripts  I was thinking it might be useful for use with Harbour since the Harbour compiler can create
"c" files which could then be used by G-Wan.  So I thought it might prove very useful if Harbour
included some support or samples of using Harbour with G-Wan.

Thank you.

Thinking about it, maybe we could solve this problem 
plus the "fireevent" feature by introducing K_* code(s) 
(f.e. K_HBSYSCLOSE) and simply passing it/them to Harbour 
just like we do for keyboard and mouse event. Such K_* 
codes could be enabled by new INKEY_* mask bit 
(f.e. INKEY_HBEVENTS).

In such way we could migrate and drop current HB_GTI_NOTIFIERBLOCK 
solution, which is quite problematic as it blocks 
the introduction of screen refreshing thread in GTWVT. If 
screen refreshing thread is in place, we could retest if 
LAYERED feature is still needed (probably it is, but not 
so badly as now).

Of course this would create slight incompatibility with 
previous Harbour versions, but I assume notifierblock is 
not very widely used and old method can relatively easily 
be updated to use custom Inkey() wrapper or simple SETKEY() 
method.

Any opinions on that? (or anything I missed? I'm not 
sure why we haven't done it this way in the past)

Brgds,
Viktor

The question is WHY ? Why they do not want to post by name ?
What reasons stop them to disclose their names ? If the name is only 
creteria, then they always have an option to create a new account with 
fake name and just post.

Yes indeed, the barrier to post or contribute to Harbour 
is near zero.

We have forum(s), wikipedia entry, user's list with 
large amount of web gateways, developer's mailing list 
with again huge amount of web gateways, we have bug 
reporting engine, SVN web access, Trac with wiki, stats 
pages, automated nightly downloads, webpage, blogs, 
feature request page, facebook group.

If this is not enough or unacceptable for some users, 
I'm personally very sorry, but the fault is not on our 
side. ( Or do we miss Twitter?? ;)

IMO any mails/complaints/request suggesting missing 
communication medium is just unnecessary noise.

Rather pls go along and exploit current mediums.

Brgds,
Viktor

I think most of these can be overcome by participating 
on user's list (there is no "bad" question there) with 
an alias created specifically for Harbour (anonymity).

Subject: [Harbour] HBIDE Project build start folder problem
Message-ID: <4BBBB052.6060209@zen.co.uk>

I am now trying to actually use hbide to build a project.
When invoked from the hbide GUI it fails to build:-

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project [ ash ]    Launch [ Yes ]    Rebuild [ Yes ]    Started [ 22:43:44 ]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting in: home/baz/Documents : /home/baz/hash/

Exit Code [ 127 ]    Exit Status [ 0 ]    Finished at [ 22:43:44 ] 
Done in [ 0.04 Secs ]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry, cannot launch project because of errors...

The problem seems to come from "Starting in: home/baz/Documents"
I have nothing harbour related in Documents, and I have no idea where 
hbide is picking this up.

If I use:-

hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q -trace -info -lang=en -rebuild

from the command line the application builds without error.

This is ash.hbp as produced by hbide :-

Subject: [Harbour] HBIDE Tab focus
Message-ID: <4BBBB5B0.2080705@zen.co.uk>

When opening a new tab using the right side tool bar, a newly opened tab 
does not acquire focus, but opens under any previously open tab.
This is a bit annoying. :-(

If I use:-

hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q -trace -info -lang=en -rebuild

At this point where are you stationed ?
Are you executing hbIDE from the same location where you are 
executing above command ?

It appears that hbIDE is been unable to set this build's working folder.

As I have no idea how paths are taken care of in *nixes, someone has 
to answer you on this matter, Vailton, are you around ?

What a coincidence.
Right at this moment I am trying to fix it.

Antonio,

    I had problems building HBIDE in the past and I understand you.
    My main problem was configuring the enviroment. I assume that you have already downloaded the right tools from the right places and have QT, MingW and of course, Harbour with contribs (HBIDE).
    I hope the way I do is correct (please anyone correct me if wrong).
    Follows how it is configured in my computer with Windows XP Home. It works for me:

<AUTOEXEC.NT>
@cls
set PATH=%PATH%;c:\x\bin;c:\x\bin\ng;
set PATH=%PATH%;c:\x\upx;
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\x\QT\4.5.3\bin;
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\x\mgw\bin;
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\x\hb\bin;
set HB_BUILD_UNICODE=yes


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I have a BATCH file that builds Harbour from SVN: (I build it in this folder: C:\x\hb\ )

<CREATE.NT>
@cls
set HB_WITH_QT=C:\x\QT\4.5.3\include
set HB_QT_STATIC=yes
set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\x\hb
set HB_BUILD_IMPLIB=yes
echo:
echo Cleanning...
echo:
CD \x\svn
mingw32-make clean
echo:
echo Clean OK!
echo:
echo Start building libs (Press ctrl-C to stop now)...
echo:
pause >>NUL:
mingw32-make install
echo:
echo Done!     


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    To build HBIDE I just point the prompt to HBIDE folder under CONTRIB and fire a simple "hbmk2 hbide.hbp" as stated by Pritpal Bedi.

    I recommend you to read the INSTALL file that comes with HARBOUR carefully because there you find valuable and important details to build and use Harbour successfully.

    I use MingW from TDM. I've compiled HBIDE and it is an impressive work by Pritpal Bedi. I am creating a small program (CUI mode) using GTWVT and when I finish it I will try to port it to *nix.

    PC is Przemyslaw Czerpak but I think you can just say Przemek since he signs down his name this way and seems to be much easier for non Slavic speakers.
    
    I hope it helps you a bit.

    Regards,


Qatan

  Subject: [Harbour] Introducing myself


  Hello everybody 


  First of all I really sorry by my bad and poor English. I made my best.


  I am a software developer for 26 years working with several programming languages mostly building Line Of Business applications in Brazil.


  I worked with Clipper since Clipper exists. I used the first copy sold in Brazil by Softcorp (succeeded by Officer and after Nantucket Brasil and CA Brasil). I worked on a company (one of the major business software companies in the world) that was practically the only VO beta tester in Brazil. It's a shame a good idea turns trash :-) As 1996 on internet era I change my career and dropped Clipper in favor of other solutions. Now I am back to LOB applications with total freedom to choose my way. I decided modernize my old Clipper applications "porting" to Harbour. I was a big lover of Clipper, specially 5.2 and I had supported the way Nantucket did think Clipper evolution and some aspects of Visual Objects developed by CA. I liked to see Clipper near to syntax and some semantics of C. Yes, I am not a typical Clipper developer. I think dBase style is a bad thing although is a necessary evil to carry.


  I want fix some errors and bad style which I made on 80's and use improved features available on Harbour.  I need rewrite my C functions, throw away some, rethink about UI (console to GUI) and databases (transition from DBF to MySQL and others RDBMS).


  I think harbor 2.0 is a wonderful piece of software. It's not perfect because the heavy legacy to honor. I like the design of a clean core with extensions. I want publicly prize Viktor and PC (I can?t write his name :-) ). I agree with most of their decisions and I strongly appreciate their work. Ok, now I can criticize some points without fear :-) I want to see Harbour moving forward, not in xHarbour style, but in smart Harbour style. In Brazil we have a popular expression: The hasty eating raw :-)


  I want to make it clear: I want help Harbour development. Now I can mainly give my opinions, try to influence some decisions, suggest enhancements, report bugs. I need to get experience with C99 and GCC. My C experience is about MS-C 5.0 (I give you a candy if you know why :-) ). I need to get time to help with code. I will try to contribute with some thing later.


  I can't help too much with documentation, IMHO the biggest Harbour need, because my bad English. I am improving Wikipedia's article now. I invite you to contribute too. It's an initial work. I will contribute more on Portuguese article. I am writing about Harbour on a variety of articles (xBase, programming languages comparison, etc). See my contribs logged as bigown. Please, feel free to add new information or edit and delete wrong or bad text. I am reviewing text bring from xHarbour. It's a good way to learn more about Harbour. Viktor, I think now the article is very bad, but not a shame anymore ;-)


  In the next days I will try reply some old messages with my opinions.


  I would like help with HBIDE but I have a very different programming style and my major problem as developer is difficulty of adaptation on other style. Totally my fault. Anyway I would like to see HBIDE  evolution mainly in code editor and debugger. In fact I hope to get HBIDE compiled. Four days trying and nothing :-) But I can't get any application using Qt or MySQL compiled. Maybe my Harbour build is wrong. I still trying.


  Well, I have to learn a lot about Harbour, try it on Linux and I hope PC (druzus) can get some time to answer some doubts about PP. I have special interest about it because I am thinking to write a transformation software to change my legacy code. I love Clipper/Harbour PP and I abuse it, but I know what I am doing.


  Now I have a lot of work to do.


  Thanks to everyone efforts. Harbour community need to be more active to "sell" Harbour on the web. IMHO most xBase programmer is individualist too much, including. I hope change this.


  Feel free to write me in private when the list is not adequate place.


  []'s
  Antonio Maniero

Thanks Qatan.

This type of participation is equally important as development.
It helps a new entrant a lot and ease him out plus it saves a lot of 
time of developers to concentrate on their target.

Keep it up.

I reduced that to:-

Path to hbmk2  /home/baz/SVN/harbour/bin/linux/gcc
Path to hbide.env  /home/baz/hbr
The main window is empty.

I was launching hbide from a desktop icon with no start folder set, so 
this is how it defaulted to ~/Documents, however if I change this to 
start in ~/hash the error is the same.

Starting in: home/baz/hash : /home/baz/hash/
/bin/bash: hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q -trace -info -lang=en : No 
such file or directory

If I move to ~/hash and run hbide from the command line the result is 
the same.

It seems to use the system current location and then add the one from 
hbide ?
"Starting in: home/baz/hash : /home/baz/hash/"

Rgds,
Barry

Ok Viktor,
thanks

but...

After any mouse event (move, click, dblclick ) except whell,  MRow()  and 
MCol()
return corect coordinates inside application window.
Do you know any way to recalculate mRow/mCol after mouse whell events
(like nRowInside := MRow() - ApplicationTopRow()....)
(mybee question is for user newsgroup)

I found another problem with GT WVG

InKey(, INKEY_ALL)  not recognize/return events:
K_MMLEFTDOWN, K_MMRIGHTDOWN, K_MMMIDDLEDOWN

MSetPos( nNewRow, nNewCol ) : not update mouse position or move cursor on 
new location

Sorry for your time,

After clean checkout of hbide and rebuild it now runs OK. Strange.

Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean, mouse position 
is not affected by wheel usage. Wheel is equivalent 
to two simple buttons on the mouse, you need to 
assign a meaning for them, f.e. map it to PgDn and 
PgUp functionality or anything.

I guess you mean _GTWVT_ (with 'T'). This was a 
compatibility breaking extension, so it got disabled 
in default Harbour builds.

You can reenable with HB_USER_CFLAGS=-D__HB_GTWVT_GEN_K_MMDOWN_EVENTS 
when building Harbour, but I cannot promise this works 
now or that it will stay around in future version. I'd rather 
suggest to modify your code to not require this extension.

[ Or use GTWVG, which has this incompatible extension enabled 
by default. ]

You're right. Apparently it was not implemented for 
GTWIN and GTWVT. Pls retry after r14281.

Brgds,
Viktor

Many thanks, I've missed it. Will upload it.

Can you create an OS/2 icon, too? Probably Maurilio or David 
can help you pointing to the right tool and format.

Yes, this limitation in current debugger code.
This is the point from my MT TODO list I sent to this list about year ago:

   3. DEBUGGER: only main thread debugger can see the names of file wide
      STATICs and have information about line numbers with good break
      points. We should add code to share this information between threads.

and it's still active. Maybe in next month I'll find some time to
implement it.

For this should answer someone who use this CL53 API.
Personally I haven't used it and I'm not familiar with
our GT code to answer if this fix can be easy applied
locally without interaction with other code.
If Viktor things that he can easy change it the probably
we should add it and mark with HB_CLP_STRICT macro.

I'm also not the user of C5.3 controls, so I can't see 
the big picture here, and as far as I know the code, the 
overall solution is not easy change.

For those interested in such patch, it's worth to look 
into original C5.3 GETSYS.PRG, where several seemingly 
related code lines are commented.

BTW the xhb solution looks incomplete and hackish 
(targeting one specific problem case instead of covering 
the whole issue).

Brgds,
Viktor

Hello,

See this sample:

local cVar := "10x"

? val(cVar)    && This return Numeric 10. The correct would not be ZERO ?

[ENDCODE]

Hi Qatan

I got compiled last night. There are so many detais, finnaly I got. Lack of
documentation is really a big problem. I did search for whole list to found
my answers.

I still trying to compile several components and examples without success
but I will try harder before post my doubts here.

Infact hbQT and hbXBP should also be rebuilt whenever there 
are major changes in hbIDE. It is based on these libraries anyway.

Hi Rossine,

No. This behavior is compatible with the Clipper. Try this:

? VAL ('10x ')
? VAL ('1 x0 ')
? VAL ('x55')
?

It should not.

Please examine: {hbide_location}/resource/hbide.env 
Copy this to /home/baz/hbr
Open the dialog again and adjust the contents to nix equivalents only for
the compiler you are using.
   I mean : SET *.* => EXPORT *.* etc.


The other quick way is:
Reach to /home/baz/hash/ ( I assume you can build as hbmk2 ash.hbp from here
)
Execute hbIDE from within console ( Window equivalant is =>
C:\>path_to_hbIDE_exe\hbIDE )

I think I have to write proper help on this topic.

Hi Maurilio,

Sorry, I mis-attributed the .ico in my ChangeLog entry.

Though I'm not 100% sure if this is the point of your
message.

Brgds,
Viktor

It was full but everything in there was Windows related so I assumed I 
should remove it.

OK sth like ? :-

       [ COMMON ]
PLATFORM  =  linux
COMPILER  =  gcc

{hb_comp} gcc
export HB_COMPILER=gcc

export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/bin/linux/gcc
export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/lib/linux/gcc
export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/include

(The last 3 lines are in my environment already)

Yes - no problem.

That is how I have done.

[baz@jackodesktop hash]$ /home/baz/SVN/harbour/contrib/hbide/hbide

Still the same with the modifications above.

Starting in: home/baz/hash : /home/baz/hash/
/bin/bash: hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q -trace -info -lang=en : No 
such file or directory

Can you try this:

       [ COMMON ]
PLATFORM  =  linux
COMPILER  =  gcc

       [ GCC ]
{hb_comp} gcc
export HB_COMPILER=gcc

export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/bin/linux/gcc
export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/lib/linux/gcc
export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/include

export PATH=$PATH:/home/_your_gcc_installation_root

Then:

Right-click on project name node
Point to "Select an Environmen..." and then select "GCC" the only option
available
You must be able to see "Env: GCC" in the status-bar panel
Then rebuild.

Infact I do not know how files are managed in .nixes so please make some 
experiments in ideprojmanager.prg line#1232   
   ::cBatch   := ::oEV:prepareBatch( ::cWrkEnvironment )

I have added some more log entries to know exactly what is 
happening at the lower levels. Please do all above after r14286.

Hi Pritpal,

May be related or not, but this code is still wrongly .exe-specific:
(I've once posted a corrected version)
---
      IF empty( cExe )
         cTkn := "hbmk2: Linking... "
         IF ( n := at( cTkn, cTmp ) ) > 0
            cT   := ".exe" // Chr( 13 )
            n1   := hb_at( cT, cTmp, n + len( cTkn ) )
            cExe := substr( cTmp, n + len( cTkn ), n1 - n - len( cTkn
) + len( cT ) )
hbide_dbg( 1, cTkn, cExe )
         ENDIF
      ENDIF
      IF empty( cExe )
         cTkn := "hbmk2: Target up to date: "
         IF ( n := at( cTkn, cTmp ) ) > 0
            cT   := ".exe" // Chr( 13 )
            n1   := hb_at( cT, cTmp, n + len( cTkn ) )
            cExe := substr( cTmp, n + len( cTkn ), n1 - n - len( cTkn
) + len( cT ) )
hbide_dbg( 2, cTkn, cExe )
         ENDIF
      ENDIF
---

Brgds,
Viktor

Yes, I know, but I could not get your patch working.
The reason may be, I am fetching the output from QTextEdit()
as a whole and then locating the string which failed with your fix.
I will try again.

I'm not typing tried and tested code here, one 
of the reason is that I don't know all the 
mundane details of the context, here my main 
point was to look for EOL (instead  of .exe), 
whatever EOL is in this specific case (it may 
also depend on platform).

Viktor

I was aware of it when you sent the patch.
Qt append the lines with other character as paragraph delimited.
So I could never detect EOL char. This was the reason I requested
you a specifically delimited string for this purpose though hbMK2.

Hi Pritpal,

I don't know what that means. Anyway unless QT removes 
the EOL, there should be a way to detect it. EOL is quite 
important in almost all line/output parsing operations, so 
I'd be very very surprised if it would be eliminated (or 
rendered undetectable) by QT.

Anyhow it's not the command line tools' job to add workarounds 
for undetectable/swallowed EOL by caller. It should be fixed 
in caller code. Since HBIDE doesn't use Harbour's own process 
launching and output catching mechanism (hb_process*() API, 
which perfectly preserve such crucial information), I can't 
really advise anything more specific here.

Brgds,
Viktor

My fault, sorry.

       [ COMMON ]
PLATFORM  =  linux
COMPILER  =  gcc

       [GCC]
{hb_comp} gcc
{content} export HB_COMPILER=gcc

{content} export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/bin/linux/gcc
{content} export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/lib/linux/gcc
{content} export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/include
{content} export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/gcc:/usr/lib/gcc


To debug more:

::cBatch   := ::oEV:prepareBatch( ::cWrkEnvironment ) 

1. Check what is the value of ::cWrkEnvironment 
2. Check what is the value of ::cBatch ( a temporary file name )
3. Explore what is wrong with idemisc.prg line#2070 function 
   hbide_getShellCommandTempFile()

Until this temp file containg above entries is not there and executed 
by the shell, hbIDE will be unable to locate environment components.
To debug, you can use standard method, say, MsgBox() or whatever
you employ for debugging. 



This call creates a temporary shell command file having entries in 
{content} lines above.

To be sure I deleted idemisc.prg and svn up :-
Restored 'idemisc.prg'

Never got into OOP and always used CLD in the past, but MsgBox() works 
OK. I will try my best and no doubt learn as I go!

I am sorry to say that I have to go word-by-word to teach you
how you can find a function in a .prg. I might have mis-wrote
line number. Anyway, it is 1237 of 2070.

Yes that is done.
hbide.env :-

       [ COMMON ]
PLATFORM  =  linux
COMPILER  =  gcc

       [GCC]
{hb_comp} gcc
{content} export HB_COMPILER=gcc

{content} export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/bin/linux/gcc
{content} export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/lib/linux/gcc
{content} export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/include
{content} export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/gcc:/usr/lib/gcc

AFAICT the function hbide_getShellCommandTempFile() is not being called 
at all.
I inserted a MsgBox() trap in the function start and it does not appear.

I will try to figure out why tomorrow - it's getting late here.

Sorry abt the missing file - I did search *.prg for it, but for some 
reason my file manager did not find it on the first pass.

The code in this IF conditional (in METHOD IdeEnvironments:prepareBatch( 
cEnvName ) )
is being skipped.

"GCC" *is* being passed to the METHOD.

IF ( n := ascan( ::aEnvrns, {|e_| e_[ 1 ] == cEnvName } ) ) > 0
....
ENDIF

So the METHOD is returning space( 255 )

So now I can guess what is happening.

Follow step below closely:

1. Run hbIDE as usual.
2. Can you see "Env: GCC" in the status-bar ? If yes,
3. Click on "Compiler Environment". Can you see [GCC] + entry in the edit
box ?, if yes,
4. Right-click on the "ash" projects tree node, can you see active prompt
"Set an Environment...", if yes,
5. Point to "Set an Environment..." and select "GCC", if you could do it
6. ash MUST build.

Please show me hbide.env and if possible, the screenshot of "Compiler
Environment" dialog 
containing whatever it has the first time you click.

hbide.env :-

       [ COMMON ]
PLATFORM  =  linux
COMPILER  =  gcc

       [GCC]
{hb_comp} gcc
{content} export HB_COMPILER=gcc

{content} export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/bin/linux/gcc
{content} export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/lib/linux/gcc
{content} export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/include
{content} export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/gcc:/usr/lib/gcc

I noticed a lower() in the function that builds the arrays, while "GCC" 
is being passed as upper case - probably off track - I was just looking 
at that when I saw your last post.

Rgds,
Barry

Hello Maniero,

    I understand you. I had (and have) the same difficulties you have.
    Documentation is something difficult to do and the developers are too busy fixing and tunning up Harbour. This is a very good quality job they are doing. 
    Do not give up! Soon you will be able to compile and test every example and maybe help to find some bugs (and solutions) to make Harbour even better.
    I am trying to develop a small ERP but I take a long time for anything because of two main reasons: 1) I am too purist and want to do something very good but simple for the end-user and 2) I do not have time... (this is the main problem and I belive is the main problem of most developers).

    Regards,

Qatan

  Hi Qatan


  I got compiled last night. There are so many detais, finnaly I got. Lack of documentation is really a big problem. I did search for whole list to found my answers.


  I still trying to compile several components and examples without success but I will try harder before post my doubts here.

    Antonio,

        I had problems building HBIDE in the past and I understand you.
        My main problem was configuring the enviroment. I assume that you have already downloaded the right tools from the right places and have QT, MingW and of course, Harbour with contribs (HBIDE).
        I hope the way I do is correct (please anyone correct me if wrong).
        Follows how it is configured in my computer with Windows XP Home. It works for me:

    <AUTOEXEC.NT>
    @cls
    set PATH=%PATH%;c:\x\bin;c:\x\bin\ng;
    set PATH=%PATH%;c:\x\upx;
    set PATH=%PATH%;C:\x\QT\4.5.3\bin;
    set PATH=%PATH%;C:\x\mgw\bin;
    set PATH=%PATH%;C:\x\hb\bin;
    set HB_BUILD_UNICODE=yes


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


    I have a BATCH file that builds Harbour from SVN: (I build it in this folder: C:\x\hb\ )

    <CREATE.NT>
    @cls
    set HB_WITH_QT=C:\x\QT\4.5.3\include
    set HB_QT_STATIC=yes
    set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\x\hb
    set HB_BUILD_IMPLIB=yes
    echo:
    echo Cleanning...
    echo:
    CD \x\svn
    mingw32-make clean
    echo:
    echo Clean OK!
    echo:
    echo Start building libs (Press ctrl-C to stop now)...
    echo:
    pause >>NUL:
    mingw32-make install
    echo:
    echo Done!     


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


        To build HBIDE I just point the prompt to HBIDE folder under CONTRIB and fire a simple "hbmk2 hbide.hbp" as stated by Pritpal Bedi.

        I recommend you to read the INSTALL file that comes with HARBOUR carefully because there you find valuable and important details to build and use Harbour successfully.

        I use MingW from TDM. I've compiled HBIDE and it is an impressive work by Pritpal Bedi. I am creating a small program (CUI mode) using GTWVT and when I finish it I will try to port it to *nix.

        PC is Przemyslaw Czerpak but I think you can just say Przemek since he signs down his name this way and seems to be much easier for non Slavic speakers.
        
        I hope it helps you a bit.

        Regards,


    Qatan

      Subject: [Harbour] Introducing myself


      Hello everybody 


      First of all I really sorry by my bad and poor English. I made my best.


      I am a software developer for 26 years working with several programming languages mostly building Line Of Business applications in Brazil.


      I worked with Clipper since Clipper exists. I used the first copy sold in Brazil by Softcorp (succeeded by Officer and after Nantucket Brasil and CA Brasil). I worked on a company (one of the major business software companies in the world) that was practically the only VO beta tester in Brazil. It's a shame a good idea turns trash :-) As 1996 on internet era I change my career and dropped Clipper in favor of other solutions. Now I am back to LOB applications with total freedom to choose my way. I decided modernize my old Clipper applications "porting" to Harbour. I was a big lover of Clipper, specially 5.2 and I had supported the way Nantucket did think Clipper evolution and some aspects of Visual Objects developed by CA. I liked to see Clipper near to syntax and some semantics of C. Yes, I am not a typical Clipper developer. I think dBase style is a bad thing although is a necessary evil to carry.


      I want fix some errors and bad style which I made on 80's and use improved features available on Harbour.  I need rewrite my C functions, throw away some, rethink about UI (console to GUI) and databases (transition from DBF to MySQL and others RDBMS).


      I think harbor 2.0 is a wonderful piece of software. It's not perfect because the heavy legacy to honor. I like the design of a clean core with extensions. I want publicly prize Viktor and PC (I can?t write his name :-) ). I agree with most of their decisions and I strongly appreciate their work. Ok, now I can criticize some points without fear :-) I want to see Harbour moving forward, not in xHarbour style, but in smart Harbour style. In Brazil we have a popular expression: The hasty eating raw :-)


      I want to make it clear: I want help Harbour development. Now I can mainly give my opinions, try to influence some decisions, suggest enhancements, report bugs. I need to get experience with C99 and GCC. My C experience is about MS-C 5.0 (I give you a candy if you know why :-) ). I need to get time to help with code. I will try to contribute with some thing later.


      I can't help too much with documentation, IMHO the biggest Harbour need, because my bad English. I am improving Wikipedia's article now. I invite you to contribute too. It's an initial work. I will contribute more on Portuguese article. I am writing about Harbour on a variety of articles (xBase, programming languages comparison, etc). See my contribs logged as bigown. Please, feel free to add new information or edit and delete wrong or bad text. I am reviewing text bring from xHarbour. It's a good way to learn more about Harbour. Viktor, I think now the article is very bad, but not a shame anymore ;-)


      In the next days I will try reply some old messages with my opinions.


      I would like help with HBIDE but I have a very different programming style and my major problem as developer is difficulty of adaptation on other style. Totally my fault. Anyway I would like to see HBIDE  evolution mainly in code editor and debugger. In fact I hope to get HBIDE compiled. Four days trying and nothing :-) But I can't get any application using Qt or MySQL compiled. Maybe my Harbour build is wrong. I still trying.


      Well, I have to learn a lot about Harbour, try it on Linux and I hope PC (druzus) can get some time to answer some doubts about PP. I have special interest about it because I am thinking to write a transformation software to change my legacy code. I love Clipper/Harbour PP and I abuse it, but I know what I am doing.


      Now I have a lot of work to do.


      Thanks to everyone efforts. Harbour community need to be more active to "sell" Harbour on the web. IMHO most xBase programmer is individualist too much, including. I hope change this.


      Feel free to write me in private when the list is not adequate place.


      []'s

No, this is for key=value pair.
This problem may peep in the next step. For now we are 
concentrating on why shell command temp file is not being created.

Do one more hack, 

       [ COMMON ]
PLATFORM  =  linux
COMPILER  =  gcc

       [GCC]
{hb_comp} gcc
{content} export HB_COMPILER=gcc

{content} export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/bin/linux/gcc
{content} export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/lib/linux/gcc
{content} export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/include
{content} export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/gcc:/usr/lib/gcc

      [ DUMMY ]
{hb_comp} gcc
{content} export HB_COMPILER=gcc

And show me the log.
Plus you can investigate ::aEnvrns contents.
Also check :
   METHOD IdeEnvironments:parse( cEnvFile )

I spent some time with Maurizio trying to investigate the error he had
this MORNING compiling hbide (QT_STRONGFOCUS non existing variable
running hbide). Following his message a reply advised to do a full
clean and compile. This EVENING Maurizio did a "svn cleanup", then a
"svn update", started the compilation and everything went ok.

I did a grep on today svn and found:
contrib/hbqt/hbqt.ch:#define Qt_StrongFocus xxxx
(actually this define was added in February)

I then saw that hbide source code has
#include "hbqt.ch" in almost all files

hbide directory is NOT listed in contrib makefile so the "make clean"
doesn't delete the temporary files....
... more, from my tests it seems that hbmk2 doesn't recognize that
hbqt.ch is changed, also if -inc is present (probably because is not
in . but in ../hbqt)....

===> so there may be cases when a hbmk2 hbide.hbp is not enough after
a clean/install but a full "-rebuild" of hbide is necessary....

You need to use -clean option with hbmk2, though 
this is rarely required in practice.

> ... more, from my tests it seems that hbmk2 doesn't recognize that
> hbqt.ch is changed, also if -inc is present (probably because is not

This is not true. What most likely happens is that you 
had a hbqt.ch copied into /include dir by using 'install' 
in the past but not using it after making subsequent 
incremental builds.

There may be, but only for changes which aren't 
or cannot be detected by hbmk2, f.e. compiler 
version/configuration change. Even library changes 
are detected. If not, pls report it with '-debuginc' 
(and possibly more details).

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Antonio which Linux distribution have you installed... or you are about
to install...?
I follow the Harbour project for many years using Linux (RedHat, Fedora then
Ubuntu) i'm ready to help you.

I think the right place is the harbour user list not this list...

Hth
Best regards

True, infact there is a hbqt.ch in /include but it should be updated
by a make install.... shouldn't it ?

Unfortunately the snadbox was updated so we can't get a snapshot.

The only thing I was able to think about Maurizio error is that "make
clean install" failed, hbqt.ch in /include was not updated, some old
libs were hanging around and doing a hbmk2 hbide.hbp compiled the last
version of hbide with older hbqt.ch headers and probably libs...

Yes, it should. But it's easy to forget when doing 
an update, or it's possible that different HB_INSTALL_PREFIX 
was used across subsequent builds.

'make clean' won't clean any _installed_ files (like hbqt.ch in 
/include), so it didn't fail, it's just that it works this way.

For best results either: a) don't use 'install' at all when 
working in the SVN sandbox (it makes things much cleaner), or 
b) set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX to any consistent location and make 
sure to always use 'install' when doing a 'make'.

If you do any of the above consistently, such error won't happen.

[ The ultimate solution would be to never install any contrib 
headers (and even libs) to central dirs, but this is currently 
not implemented, mainly because I miss input from *nix users 
about such layout. On win/dos/os2 this is not a problem. ]

Viktor

There was a change in THBQtUi.prg in hbQT itself and not in the 
hbqt.ch. So you need to build hbQT only to cover that change.
Probably you are looking at wrong place.

Maurizio uses a batch file to do a clean/install (the same I use) so
he can't "forget"... at this point I may only thing that the make did
not complete, the error message is redirected to a file so Maurizio

In my reasing it is the only way to have such an error after a "make

Looks like my answers are totally worthless here.

So my short suggestion is not to use 'install' at all, 
in case anyone is indeed interested in the solution.

Has anybody experience with usage of lCaseSensitive parameter in
HB_RegExAll  function ?

HB_RegExAll( <cRegEx>         , ;
             <cString>        , ;
            [<lCaseSensitive>], ;

            [<nWichMatch>]    , ;
            [<lMatchOnly>]      ) --> aAllRegexMatches

It seems not working for me. It is allways case sensitive.
Could anybody send an example demonstarting lCaseSensitive parameter ?

Thanks.

If 'install' is unsafe could be discouraged in doc or an alert could be made
in order to use it in the svn sandbox.
Anyway, a deletion of all installed files via a clean flag could be the
safest way of avoid this problems.

Viktor, your answers are like GOLD, not worthless. Infact you pointed
to the right direction, a hbqt.ch file in /include....

What is not "normal" is that /include/hbqt.ch was not updated by a
"make clean install" and I was trying to understand what happened to
make the process more straightforward...


I'd add that:

- hbide should be in utils and not in contrib, because it is more a
utility than a library... and it is not normally built by make

- due to recurring problems in compiling hbide that show up in the
mailing list, and Maurizio problem was just an example, there should
be something not idiot-proof in the process and I was trying to help
looking for possible problems.

For example, now I learned that it is better to always set
HB_INSTALL_PREFIX in order to avoid problems, and it is probably a
smart thing to do... I will do some tests later....

You are to investigate why "GCC" is not found in ::aEnviron.
Only then we can proceed. Theoretically, it must find and I am 
at a loss what is going wrong exactly.

'install' is safe. It's enough to know what it does.

'install's purpose is to copy all files required to 
use the package to a location which the user specifies.
This location is typically outside the realm of SVN.

> Anyway, a deletion of all installed files via a clean flag could be the
> safest way of avoid this problems. 

clean's job is not to mess with anything the user 
has 'install'ed. This is basic make system principle.
Installed files are outside the realm of SVN or our 
"jurisdiction". It's users responsibility to update 
them, or delete them.

If install is a problem for someone, or someone isn't 
sure about what it does, it should not be used, that's 
all. Harbour can perfectly work on any platforms without 
using 'install'. I personally use 'install' only when 
creating a stable binary build for my own projects. 
For playing around, I don't use it.

There is no such price, if you use .hbc files. That 
would be the whole point of such move actually.

So it means re-introduction of extended "search replace" is still 
problematic on Linux. I have to remove it again.

BTW have you ever build a project in Linux via hbIDE ?
If yes, can you or someone help Barry Jackson to locate the cause?

It cannot be in utils, as it's not part of core 
and can't easily be part of core due to the heavy 
QT dependency and dependency on other non-core 
parts such as hbxbp. We also don't want to tie our 
core to any specific GUI engine.

So IMO it's perfectly well located now. In fact it's 
ahead of the curve, since I plan to convert other 
contribs to use hbmk2 in the future.

Sorry, but I can't see huge amount of problem reports 
about HBIDE builds. What I see is that some users sometimes 
forget to rebuild all required components, or have 
otherwise messed up environment. There is a limit we can 
handle, but we cannot handle all possible ways users 
can mess up things. In such case, it's best to just 
restart with a clean build as suggested by INSTALL 
troubleshooting section.

Personally the worse thing I had to do with HBIDE 
so far is to rebuild whole Harbour to make it work.

Otherwise it builds smoothly.

Well, HB_INSTALL_PREFIX will default to SVN dir 
or system dir on *nix by default (since these are 
the only known dir by the make system). So, if you 
leave it to default, it's much better option to not 
use it at all, as I suggested several times.

So yes, to put it your way, if you use 'install', 
it's always good to also set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX, 
otherwise there is just no point in using 'install'.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Shum,

I too have trouble with new type in MS SQl.
Advice from Mindaugas, try change in fil\harbour\contrib\rddsql\sddodbc\odbcdd.c

Fe.:
?319?      switch( iDataType )
?320?      {
?321?         case SQL_CHAR:
?322?         case SQL_VARCHAR:

?326?           pFieldInfo.uiType = HB_FT_STRING;
?327?           break;

Or make trick wthh convert type in query, like this :

select p.ID_PODMIOT as ID_PODMIOTU, convert( varchar, u.ID_klienta) as ID_klienta,...

With this I can work with MsSql :)

Message-ID: <w2jfd76479f1004080304s1460d50clf129157bb1b9827e@mail.gmail.com>

I cannot have hbpcre compiled and installed on my Harbour environment on
Ubuntu 9.10

I compile Harbour sources with this setting:

export HB_CONTRIBLIBS="hbqt hbct hbhpdf hblog hbxml hbmzip hbzip hbxbp hbtip
hbvpdf hbgd hbpgsql hbcurl hbmysql hbsqlit3 hbssl hbodbc rddsql gtqtc hbmisc
hbpcre"

and to try to have hbpcre installed i later also put this var

export HB_WITH_PCRE=yes

also put

export HB_CONTRIBLIBS=

so the lib can be guessed.

I have referred to the Harbour source INSTALL file to get some info and to
check the required files

But at compile time i always have this answer from the system and the hbpcre
lib not install on my system i need it to try the samples of
wxHarbour GUI cross platform for the Harbour compiler

OK
With [DUMMY] entry in compiler env. and GCC selected it does now make 
temp script which is correct. (Remove the dummy and it fails again)

/home/baz/tmp/fpw5bh.sh : Exists
/home/baz/tmp/fpw5bh.sh && hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q -trace -info

/bin/bash: /home/baz/tmp/fpw5bh.sh && hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q

So, now the problem seems to be the missing full path to hbmk2

You do not need it if you already have system PCRE library.
In such case Harbour use it instead of the local one included
in Harbour SVN.

> export HB_WITH_PCRE=yes

If you want to force using local harbour PCRE library (HBPCRE) instead
of system PCRE library then set:
   export HB_WITH_PCRE=local

Similar situation is with ZLIB. If you want to force using Harbour
local ZLIB (HBZLIB) instead of system ZLIB library then set:
   export HB_WITH_ZLIB=local

HBPCRE is not necessary. It makes exactly the same job as system PCRE.
If some samples in 3-rd party projects use explicitly HBPCRE or HBZLIB
library in some link commands then they should be updated.
The easiest way is using to hbmk2 which automatically choose between
HBCPRE or system PCRE library depending on Harbour build time settings.

Hi,


1) -8 and -9 are SQL_WCHAR and SQL_WVARCHAR. It is not related to BIGINT.

2) BIGINT support was added 2010-04-07.

3) SQL_WCHAR and SQL_WVARCHAR are already in SVN from 2009-11-17, so, no 
changes are required.

It works for me.

   proc main()

      local aResults

      cRegEx := "[<][A-Z0-9]*[>]"
      cString := "<P1> $ <P2> / <P3> - <p4> * <p5>"
      aResults := HB_RegExAll( cRegEx, cString, .T. )

      aResults := HB_RegExAll( cRegEx, cString, .F. )
      ? hb_valToExp( aResults )

My results:
   {{"<P1>"}, {"<P2>"}, {"<P3>"}}
   {{"<P1>"}, {"<P2>"}, {"<P3>"}, {"<p4>"}, {"<p5>"}}
so they are correct.

Ignore that silly remark - hbmk2 is already in the path and should be found.

Something strange though.
I paused hbide just after it wrote (and closed) the temp script.
I found the script and ran it after displaying PATH and looking at the 
script:-

[baz@jackodesktop tmp]$ echo $PATH

Note that $PATH is not affected by running the script.
I thought it may be a permissions problem, or that it needed to be 
executable, but
[baz@jackodesktop tmp]$ chmod +x 7aqf54.sh
[baz@jackodesktop tmp]$ ls -l 7aqf54.sh
-rwxrwxr-x 1 baz baz  233 2010-04-08 11:47 7aqf54.sh
Makes no difference. Still nothing is added to PATH.
Running :-
[baz@jackodesktop tmp]$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/gcc:/usr/lib/gcc
at the command line DOES add those to the path.

Baffled...

Since hbmk2 is already in my PATH, I do not understand why the build 
fails (despite the the script not modifying the PATH).

OK got some painting to do so will ponder this while brushing :-)

This is wrong, since hbpcre is not a contrib.

Also wrong, see "HOW TO ENABLE OPTIONAL COMPONENTS BEFORE BUILD"
in INSTALL, which says you can use 'local' value to force locally 
hosted copy of external libs, like hbpcre.

It's best to leave it empty, but detection always 
takes place for each contrib, however you configure 
HB_CONTRIBLIBS.

Ops, I think I've been there. The problem is with 
parallel execution of script and HBIDE. HBIDE will 
call external process, but continue to run, so it 
will instantly delete the script, so the script 
will not run.

I remember fixing this once.

Try removing FERASE() call for the temporary 
external script to prove that.

Viktor

Shouldn't fpw5bh.sh have the hbmk2 line as its last line?

I anticipated that.
I added msgbox() line in FUNCTION hbide_getShellCommandsTempFile
here:-

          FWrite( fhnd, cCmdFile )
          FClose( fhnd )
       msgbox(cCmdFile)                 <==

..and left hbide hanging there while I did the tests.
Any other thoughts?

So, just a "mingw32-make clean all" ?

But in order to have a clean situation I completely deleted the
sandbox, did a new checkout and built with a HB_INSTALL_PREFIX...
build failed... I then deleted the sandbox, did a new checkout and
built again... and again it failed


./bin/win/mingw/hbrun.exe --hb:gtcgi ./config/postinst.prg
! Making C:\cvs\harbour\harbour\bin\hbmk.cfg...
! Making shared version of Harbour binaries...
windres.exe: can't open icon file `utils/hbrun/': Permission denied
hbmk2: Error: Running resource compiler. 1

I know that 99.99% is not harbour fault but I'd like to know how I can
trace the build process to see the command line of windres call....

I want to repeat that this error started to appear after I deleted the
/include directory (and did an update... ) so that no "installed" .ch
files were present..

Many thanks  to Premzek and Viktor for the clear answer.

Surely i will send some note to the developer of wxHarbour BTW i was solving
this compiling samples issue with this statement:

make HBLIBSTYPE=shared

The samples coming into the wxHarbour directory structure have singles
GNUmakefile, one for directory and these files seems to be auto generated by
http://www.bakefile.org
as far i can read in all the GNUmakefile files header, i suppose Bakefile
tool don't generate hbmk2 make statement (i don't know that tool).

Best regards
Marco

Please read http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/prepostpath.htm

try:

source 7aqf54.sh

to get the PATH exported var changed not only into that script

Viktor i see here  http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxharbour/develop you are
an admin of the project

I was playing with samples i like them, i like the gtk lib.

Do you think wxHarbour might be a good GUI choice for my Ubuntu environment
or it is in a too early state?

Do you know some related wxHarbour on the net with more complete samples and
doc...?

Thank you, best regards

Marco

Seem that curdirve is not a clipper function
http://www.ousob.com/ng/clguide/ng3ca.php
but is a xbase++ so is present hbxbp.lib (xbase compatibility lib)
is also a xharbour function

harbour instead have hb_curdrive
#ifdef __HARBOUR__
#ifndef __XHARBOUR__
#XTRANSLATE curdrive( =>  hb_curdrive(
#endif
#endif
i have fear have missing something

Can be safety addedd for compiling source with hb_curdrive?

Hi,

I'm using:
mingw32-make clean
mingw32-make

Never use 'all', but could also work.

You can use 'set HBMK_OPTIONS=-trace'

If my diagnoses seems false, I hope someone will send 
a better one. Anyhow it doesn't seem like a malfunction 
in Harbour.

You're welcome.

wxHarbour has hbmk2 make files (I've added them). To be 
honest I don't know why it has also a lot of other types 
of makefiles, but for sure hbmk2 ones also worked last 
time I checked. (if not, it takes very little updating 
job to make them work)

Yes, I think it's a good choice. Quite portable, 
very light, up to the point lib. As a bonus you 
can easily create static executables (though the 
license should be verified).

> Do you know some related wxHarbour on the net with more complete samples and doc...?

No, sorry. Though AFAIK the included samples are 
quite good and can give you an idea of the capabilities.

Thanks Marco - interesting read,
that is the reason my test failed.

Alex - Maybe the script should call hbmk2 - not sure, I will await 
comment from Pritpal. :-)

I don't know if deleting FERASE() helped.

Anyway, in HBIDE CRLF is permanently mapped
to Chr( 13 ) + Chr( 10 ) for all platforms, which is
wrong, and no .sh file will work with such EOL.

To make HBIDE portable, such hard-wired windos
EOL should never be used and all file reading
functions should accept all kinds of EOLs.

Brgds,
Viktor

Show me the hbIDE's full screen shot when

To copy the text from within Output Console, start it from some line
which does not have error information.
But I am interested more in under what circumstances and of what 
type of error you are double-clicking.

Hi Prital Bedi,

I find that hbxbp is not compitable to Xbase++ as follow:
oDlg:drawingArea:clipChildren := .T.     (In Xbase++ ... it is exported var
without error)
http://www.mingyik.com/dnload/stxbp10.jpg

      LOCAL oDlg, oMenuBar, oMenu

      Local oAppDlg:=AppDesktop()
      Local lTestFlag:=.F.

      If P1<>NIL
          lTestFlag := .T.
      Endif

      // Create dialog

FERASE() is issued when process is "finished".
So it does not collide with parallel running. Also 
it works perfectly on Windows, so I suspect that it
the script is not executed at all due some reason,
though I may be wrong.

This variable is only to set which type of Harbour libraries are
to be used in linking phase: static/shared.

I'll check why this is needed, however I'll check that the hbmk2
utility builds ok the library/samples.

The make files are 'native' make files for the following 
development environments:

GNUmakefile:
	Linux, Mac OS X - using gcc

makefile.bcc:
	Windows XP ( and up ) - Borland BCC 5 compiler

makefile.gcc:
	Windows XP ( and up ) - MinGW compiler

makefile.vc:
	Windows XP ( and up ) - MSVC compiler


Any way, I'll check for hbmk2 support here.



best regards,

Teo

If you will pause hbIDE, probably Qt might have stopped executing
the child process as well, no ? If yes, then try not to pause it here
but just comment out FERASE() and you will be able to view the contents.

To view environment setting, try to dump the path into output console
after process is started or just before "finished" is called.

Please add path to Harbour bin as the last line ( in hbide.env )
   {content} export PATH=$PATH:/home/baz/SVN/harbour/

It appears script is not "executed" at all.

Could be. Depends on how process is called by 
QT on *nix. For sure it has been problem on my 
Windows system, too, but I didn't check it 
recently.

The CRLF issue is for sure there though.

All these worked last time I checked the .hbp files. 

Anyway there is nothing fundamental why hbmk2 
couldn't work on all of these platforms, which 
means hbmk2 can cover all platform. (maybe minor 
fixes are needed)

Brgds,
Viktor

OK
But before I do, may I ask whether the line I see in the console output 
is the command used to launch the build?
/bin/bash: /home/baz/tmp/ao9flu.sh && hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q 
-trace -info -lang=en

If it's just the error message only then fine, but if it is the command 
then it should not have the ":".

Without this, (using a dummy script in ~/tmp) it runs OK :-

/bin/bash /home/baz/tmp/test.sh && hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q 
-trace -info -lang=en

I have searched your code to try to see the actual command line but 
can't get at it.

Rgds
Barry

Teo , I just try your wxHarbour , and I 've downloaded ok and build library
without problems

But when I try to compile samples I get this error

/dbbrowser'
(cd helloworld && make all)
cd: 1: can't cd to helloworld
make: *** [helloworld] Error 2
bruno@notebook:~/Descargas/wxHarbour-0.5.0-0/samples$ ls


this folder not exist and helloworld1 either

I just tested running the script at the command line, after killing the 
FERASE() as suggested.

PATH is ONLY changed for the duration of the script.

If I add "echo $PATH" as last line INSIDE the script, the path has changed.
Once script is finished then the PATH is re-set to original.

See the post & link by Marco earlier.

Very intresting your sample!
Have you other xbp sample?

i confirm problem and then i add a litte problen regarding hbide
with your source named xpp01.prg
using Follow is my xpp01.hbp

 I can compile and run with hbmk2
if i execute hbide xpp01.hpp with

BTW, all of the above is not necessary for hbmk2.
(given that gcc is already in the PATH, which it 
is on most systems)

So I'd suggest not to confuse matters with these 
unnecessary lines. In fact it's outright dangerous.

For hbmk2, it's enough to put in the PATH, or 
refer to it with an absolute name (f.e. /home/me/harbour/bin/hbmk2)
and it will find everything automatically.

Even HB_COMPILER=gcc is totally unnecessary.

Viktor

Hi Massimo Belgrano,

 

I compile the prg as follow:

 

I put xpp01.prg into  d:\hb20\contrib\hbxbp\tests    then:

 

d:\hb20\contrib\hbxbp\tests>hbmk2 xpp01.prg -Ld:\Qt\4.5.3\lib

 

 

Where d:\Qt\4.5.3\lib    for hbmk2 to find qt libs 

 

 

Shum

Hi Prital Bedi,

I find that hbxbp is not compitable to Xbase++ as follow:
oDlg:drawingArea:clipChildren := .T.     (In Xbase++ ... it is exported var
without error)
http://www.mingyik.com/dnload/stxbp10.jpg
Sample source as follow:

  Function AppSys()
  Return( NIL )

  Function  Main( P1 )
     LOCAL nEvent, mp1, mp2, oXbp
     LOCAL oDlg, oMenuBar, oMenu

     Local oAppDlg:=AppDesktop()
     Local lTestFlag:=.F.

     If P1<>NIL
         lTestFlag := .T.
     Endif

     // Create dialog
     oDlg       := XbpDialog():new( oAppDlg , , {30,50}, {400,250} )
     oDlg:title := "Harbour + QT + hbxbp Dialog with Menubar"
     oDlg:clipChildren := .T.
     oDlg:drawingArea:clipChildren := .T.
     oDlg:create()

     If lTestFlag
         oXbp := Xbpstatic():new( oDlg:drawingArea, oDlg, {20,100},

         oXbp:caption := LTrim(Str(oAppDlg:currentSize()[1])) +","+
LTrim(Str(oAppDlg:currentSize()[2]))
         oXbp:create()
     Endif

     // Create XbpMenubar in the dialog

There is a problem with the makefile that build all the samples,
I'll fix it, for now I suggest you to enter to each directory and build
there the sample, e.g.:

$ cd samples/dbbrowser
$ make run


best regards,

I've committed a fix, pls check it.

.sh files should have LF as EOL. It also 
good to use platform native EOL in other 
places.

Hi Marco

At the momento I will just play with Harbour on Linux. Probably I will try
on CentOS. When I have a problem, I post here. For now I need solve some
problems on Windows yet. I have difficulties with dependencies. I need learn
about hbp, hbc and hbm formats. It's just my opinion, but seems too
complicated build application with external dependencies. I got Qt and MySQL
based applications built, but I am trying with Blat and OpenSSL now. I
believed it would be ease with I learned with Qt and MySQL, but I still
having problems without a clue.

Hi Pritpal,
Here is it: http://www.mlacecilia.com/hbide_err.JPG 

Obviously, if i take to select starting outside the red error lines all
works fine (same with "Select all" at right click).

Since we are talking of this can you please also tell me why the function
PrgVersion() results undefined in despite that is contained in main prg?
Same sources compile fine in xMate. The others errors have reason to arise,
but i don't understand why the symbol isn't resolved.
TIA.
Best regards.

It compiled without errors. Then I issued  mingw32-make install
(HB_INSTALL_PREFIX was not set) and I got:
windres.exe -IC:/cvs/harbour/harbour/include
C:/DOCUME~1/ADMINI~1/IMPOST~1/Temp/hbmk_g8aur0.rc -O coff -o
C:/DOCUME~1/ADMINI~1/IMPOST~1/Temp/hbmk_g8aur0.reso
windres.exe: can't open icon file `utils/hbrun/': Permission denied
hbmk2: Error: Running resource compiler. 1

Unfortunately hbmk2 does some cleanups and so the temp files get
deleted... is there a way to keep them ?

Thanks
Francesco

yes i have compiled with hbmk2 and notice that error appen also here
y use
hbmk2 xpp01.prg -Ld:\Qt\4.5.3\lib
instead i use config library file hbxbp.hbc
hbmk2 xpp01.prg C:\harbour\contrib\hbxbp\hbxbp.hbc

in hbp you can have exploded command line and point to hbc
------------------------xpp01.hbp
xpp01.prg
C:\harbour\contrib\hbxbp\hbxbp.hbc

then
hbmk2 xpp01.hbp work

The license is "wxWindows Licence" (also known as "wxWidgets License") and
it's basically an LGPL license but yet less restrictive. See the following link:

Just to clear confusion:

wxHarbour is not GTKMM or GTK based.

It's based on wx lib.

wx lib internally uses different GUI subsystems 
depending on platform.

On Linux it uses GTK, on Windows it uses native 
Windows API. I forgot about Darwin.

Brgds,
Viktor

Under Mac OS X, wxWidgets uses Carbon, Cocoa will be also
available as a stable framework soon.

You can use -debugstub option to dump temporary stub file content to stdout.

I've found the problem in hbmk2 code, it was an 
old bug exploited by recent addition to hbrun.hbp.

I'll commit the fix soon. Thanks for the information.

Viktor

You are right when we assume that there is only ONE 
environment developer needs or have set his desktop from the 
very begining and he donot want to compile with another compiler
or other type of project. In that case there is absolutely no need 
to even touch hbide.env. Without any anvironment set, hbIDE only 
executes the hbMK2 with its parameters and under the environemnt
hbMK2 detects automatically.

But what if someone wants to experiment with different 
compilers and different type of projects, just like in my case.
There comes the concept of hbide.env. For example,
I compile my ERP solutions "Vouch" with MSVC, BCC, MINGW and 
OpenWatcome. I never leave the interface even once. I just 
change the environment and there it goes.

If you said that, you must be having a broader view of the issue, 
I am sure, but still my reasoning is valid. This is not imposed
on the user, this is suggested if he ever want to maintain 
many projects, all built under different environmrnts.

Thank you.
This alert is all-right. The GPF after this alert, maybe ( I have to
investigate ),
due to the fact that no edit-tab is on on this panel "Stats".
Just to confirm my beliefe, can you carry the same operations after bringing
"Main" editors panel before carrying them ?
I will fix it in a while.

PrgVersion() is nowhere called in hbIDE.  OR I am unable to understand you.

No problem, but even in this case, the best solution 
is to setup PATH properly for given compiler and let 
hbmk2 autodetect compiler.

HB_COMPILER is _only_ necessary if there are multiple 
C compiler present in the PATH at the same time.

If that tells anything, on Windows I compile for 
practically all possible Harbour targets and I never 
touch HB_COMPILER.

Viktor

In its main program file there is  a function definition
code..
code...
code...
function PrgVersion()
return (a certain value)


When compiling from hbide he gets:
../(path)/(file).a(_ERRSYS.o):_ERRSYS.c:(.data+0x3a8): undefined
reference to `HB_FUN_PRGVERSION'
../(path)/(file).a(_PWD.o):_PWD.c:(.data+0x1e8): undefined reference

I have pulled the relevant part of this issue.
Output does not contain any token specific to this issue.
I am heavily dependanr on .exe extension plus 
"hbmk2: Linking... " or "hbmk2: Target up to date: " tokens.

In above case .exe is created properly as status code == 0.
But there is no string describing the output file. I will commit 
in a while, if I cannot find the file, I will use "Launch Program"
field of Project Properties dialog.

Yes - no problem, now however I think I am seeing the actual command 
line below the "script exists" line.
Just to be sure there was nothing odd going on in my set-up I have since 
started with fresh new SVN and re-built harbour. I have also read a lot 
of Viktor's messages about paths and env vars etc. and removed all but 
the path to harbour and qt4 in my main environment.
I have not used install, just make.

I have just been playing with :-
       cC   := iif( hbide_getOS() == "nix", "", "/C " )
and tried with :-
       cC   := iif( hbide_getOS() == "nix", "sh ", "/C " )
and :-
       cC   := iif( hbide_getOS() == "nix", ".", "/C " )

Sadly none work and all produce the same file not found error. I would 
have expected the "sh " to have solved this.

You are right - the script is not being run.
I added the line:-

{content} echo "this ran" > /home/baz/hash/ash_hbide.txt

to the script and the file has not appeared.

Output :-

Not sure why, but no matter how I cut and paste the above, the text

We can document it or omit it altogether. But I had some issues
in the past. I do not remember exactly what these were but 
soon I will experiment when I will  turn to building refinements 
scheduled next week.

Virtually, only C compiler specific path should go inside it,
rest hbMK2 should take care, this is the goal for Harbour projects.

No, this point just constructs a string to tell shell command the 
behavior of command line execution. For Windows it is "/C "
means execute and terminate.

The is important:

/bin/bash: /home/baz/tmp/h2zifo.sh && hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q 
-trace -info -lang=en : No such file or directory

This output is sent by QProcess:read() method when an error is generated.

/bin/bash:       is sent by Qt and I do not know what it is.

Can you check the value of        <cCmd> ?

Oh, I have no idea. It is returned by linker, so may be some flag is
missing.

That is similar format to bash error message format e.g.

[baz@jackodesktop ~]$ qwertyuiop
bash: qwertyuiop: command not found
[baz@jackodesktop ~]$

sh is normally a link to bash which is always in /bin in the system 
path, so /bin/bash does the same as sh

/bin/bash

Subject: [Harbour] hbqt: a couple of questions
Message-ID: <z2s6943770e1004081539i7c081768jec89753bdd1053cc@mail.gmail.com>

This evening I started to "study" hbqt and I started from the sample
code I found on trolltech site... they are very basic samples based on
qt3 but so simple that they are still valid.
I converted sample 1 in a few minutes... just pay attention to
constructor that in Harbour is not overloaded...
    QPushButton hello( "Hello world!", 0 );
    hello.resize( 100, 30 );
becomes
  hello := QPushButton():new(  )
  hello:setText( "Hello, World!" )
  hello:resize( 100,30)

Sample 2 adds a "connect" and it becomes a bit more complicated:
    QPushButton quit( "Quit", 0 );
    quit.resize( 75, 30 );
    QObject::connect( &quit, SIGNAL(clicked()), &a, SLOT(quit()) );

I translated to

   quit := QPushButton():new( )
   quit:setText( "Quit!" )
   quit:resize( 100,30)
   QT_SLOTS_CONNECT( s_slots, quit, "clicked()", {|| MsgInfo( "pressed" ) } )

and it works... but I had to define and initialize s_slots and there
is no 1:1 match with QObject::connect ( I also added a MsgInfo
function, of course)

So I started to ask myself the necessity to have s_slots and s_events
(whatever you call them) defined and handled by the programmer.
And (I understand that QT_SLOTS_CONNECT has a more powerfull syntax
since it doesn't require you to create SLOT handlers in objects) was
thinking about the correct way to translate the line
QObject::connect( &quit, SIGNAL(clicked()), &a, SLOT(quit()) );
in harbour/Qt ...

Thanks,
Francesco

So it means 

/bin/bash /home/baz/tmp/h2zifo.sh&&  hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q -trace
-info -lang=en
                                          ^^^^^^
is not executing       /home/baz/tmp/h2zifo.sh&&    [ Notice no space
between .sh and && ]
if this is the case, I am confused, why not it shows up a space inbetween.
the constructor is : cArg := iif( empty( ::cBatch ), cC, cC + ::cBatch + "
&& "  )
                                                                                               
^^^^^

I am really lost.

Harbour's signal/slot handelling is superior then Qt itself.
We can attach a codeblock with it and in the calling code
we can update n number of objects visible into that class/function.
Whereas in Qt it is one-to-one mechanism. The other way around
is also there in Qt but that is little cumbersome.

So, why do you want to translate the 
QObject::connect( &quit, SIGNAL(clicked()), &a, SLOT(quit()) );
in another way ?

The hbmk2 utility is working ok in the wxHarbour library.

To build the library:

1. Change to your current wxHarbour directory:

	$ cd wxHarbour

2. Build the lib using hbmk2:

	$ hbmk2 wxharbour.hbp

If all goes ok, then you can try to build a sample:

1. Change to any sample dir:

	$ cd samples/dbf_ctrls1

2. Build the sample using hbmk2 with the wxharbour.hbc file:

	$ hbmk2 ../../wxharbour.hbc dbf_ctrls1.prg

3. If all goes ok, then run the sample:

	$ ./dbf_ctrls1


Please test after SVN:

Why "clicked()" is not a codeblock?

Maniero, can you please instructuct your mail account not to 
attach the full body of the mail you are replying to ? It is really 
annoying to see the same thing multiple times in a single thread.

Sorry, but i'm not sure to have understood your request.
I selected the edit panel and done same operation.
I updated the screenshot at http://www.mlacecilia.com/hbide_err.JPG

Now, after the error message, the GPF don't take place.
Tell me if i'm wrong.
Thanks.

1) is there some reason for having s_slots and s_events handled by the
programmer and not hidden someway ?

2) how can I translate 1:1 from c++
QObject::connect( &quit, SIGNAL(clicked()), &a, SLOT(quit()) );
to harbour/Qt ...


I was translating some C++ sample code in order to do some basic tests
and a simple 8 lines c++ code translated in 20 harbour lines including
the handling of the s_slots variable.... Also, I could not translate
the connect call - I know owr connect is better but how can I
translate ?

Don't get confused between the .sh extension which is optionally used 
for shell scripts, and the command sh which is a link to /bin/bash.

Where are you seeing no space between script.sh and && ?

cCArg is:-
/home/baz/asd45f.sh &&

I have not seen it without the space.

The final command sent to the command line should  AFAICT be:-
/bin/bash /home/baz/tmp/ahrl8i.sh && hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q 
-trace -info -lang=en

Running that on command line works fine.

At present (from the console output) it seems to be just:-
/home/baz/tmp/ahrl8i.sh && hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q -trace -info 
-lang=en

If I change to this
  cC   := iif( hbide_getOS() == "nix", "/bin/bash ", "/C " )

  then the console output looks correct, but still does not run:-

/home/baz/tmp/mw7pe1.sh : Exists
/bin/bash /home/baz/tmp/mw7pe1.sh && hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q 
-trace -info -lang=en
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting in: home/baz/hash : /home/baz/hash/
/bin/bash: /bin/bash /home/baz/tmp/mw7pe1.sh && hbmk2 
/home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q -trace -info -lang=en : No such file or directory

If Qt sends the /bin/bash cCmd part invisibly, then I am of course 
wrong, but I would have expected the full command to be shown in the 
error message.

Yes, because in Harbour we are calling Qt classes by function calls
instead of class/method calls. We cannot call Qt classes directly.
Though my explanation may appear a bit tough but this is how 
Harbour bindings for Qt are implemented. We are calling Qt classes
from PRG level and not from C++ level.

No, you cannot. This is not possible. Examine hbqt/hbqt_hbslots.cpp.

As above.
You need to understand the whole mechanism adopted to bring 
Qt classes to PRG level, including but not limited, to know how 
C++ function wrappers work to pull/push Qt classes.

Thank you for your courtesy and your effective work.

I have minor suggestions:
1. I noticed that enabling the pages tab in the right panel, via menu or via
toolbar it's the same, don't give focus to the page itself. Could be done?
2. Could be added the support also for non code files ( i.e.: .ini, .txt,
.fwg, .xml, .customextension ) so they are stored in the project, are
editable by the hbIDE editor and don't partecipate to the hbp build
3. If the point 2. is suitable, could be associated to the extension a
command to execute on the files having that extension? I means same
behaviour of the very good xDevStudio of Renato Vailton, allowing to launch
a program/command/script applied to the list of files grouped by extension.
4. Could be added one slot for pre and post build? Most important the post
build slot, as could allow additional jobs as constructing installer,
posting on web the installer, etc.

If something results cryptic on the use of those features ask me and i'll
try to better explain what i'm meaning.
 
Best regards.
Maurizio

It should be the case with hbIDE but it is not...

You are not taking into consideration <cCmd>.
QProcess() expects two components, command and parameters.
What you see are parameters, command is verified with <cCmd>
as it shows up as - /bin/bash ( you confirmed in a prev post ).

No, this is not the correct way, it will never work.

Not invisibly. We are sending it as <cCmd>, <cArgs> where 
cCmd == /bin/bash 
cArgs == /home/baz/tmp/ahrl8i.sh && hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q -trace
-info -lang=en

Don't be disheartened. We will succeed one day.

Hi Pritpal Bedi,

I found that XbpDialog class lack of the following class vars

- alWaysOnTop                 default value is  .F.
- border                           default value is XBPDLG_RAISEDBORDERTHICK
(defined in xbp.ch)
- titleBar                          default value is .F.
- moveWithOwner              default value is .T. 
- origin                             default value is XBPDLG_ORIGIN_OWNER 
(defined in xbp.ch)

Lack of all  border constants (ie.: XBPDLG_RAISEDBORDERTHICK ... )

Is it be possible to add slots and events holder variables 
to QApplication class? If technically possible, IMO it should 
be done to clean this part of QT. It wouldn't even be 
an incompatible change, just convenience, since these 
two holders are always needed for QT apps.

Viktor

It should not be difficult. But I need more input. If possible show by

It is possible. I need more info about what actions will comprise such

I understand that we are using Harbour functions to call C++ functions like
HB_FUNC( QT_SLOTS_CONNECT ) that call a static function connect_signal
that finally does the "real" connect, for example:
if( signal == ( QString ) "clicked()" )
   return object->connect( object, SIGNAL(clicked()), t_slots, SLOT(
clicked()), Qt::AutoConnection );

We are passing s_slots from Harbour to connect_signal where it is
HBSlots * t_slots... and this is my concern: WHY are you passing
s_slots back/forth between Harbour and C++ ?

Since from example number 2 slots are used (a Qt program without
slots/events is almost useless..., just a basic display perhaps...)
WHY don't change hbqt_slots.cpp to include a file-wide static variable
s_slots, completely handled by Qt (so no Harbour GC hassle) and then
remove harbour level s_slots variables ?

I know it is a non compatible change (well, it may become compatible
if  you check number of parameters in QT_SLOTS_CONNECT) but it frees
the programmer from the s_slots burden...

There may be only one problem: if Qt may handle multiple slots
lists... something I sincerely don't know... but, properly changing
QT_SLOTS_CONNECT this may be handled too.

script
use label "action script"
Open Public method from button or tab control and return test vaule in

add Button verify script

OK I made some progress - lots more tests after hacking 
IdeProjManager:buildProject

I made a script:- /home/baz/hash/test_hb.sh and hard coded
cArg to be "test_hb.sh" and removed all the other following commands etc.
It runs OK and writes a message to the console.
I then replaced it with just "updt" which is a globally accessible 
script I have which as user just throws up a warning massage and quits.
That runs OK
I then changed it to  cArg := "test_hb.sh && updt"
and bang :-

test_hb.sh && updt
Starting in: home/baz/hash : /home/baz/hash/
/bin/bash: test_hb.sh && updt: No such file or directory

 From the command line:-

[baz@jackodesktop ~]$ cd hash
[baz@jackodesktop hash]$ sh test_hb.sh && updt
Test text from test_hb.sh                              <= correct

Sorry, you must run this as root. (Use su NOT su -)    <= correct
[baz@jackodesktop hash]$

I also tested just using the test_hb.sh script with a parameter passed 
to it ( "test_hb.sh parameter" )and it failed the same way.

Is Qt outputting real CHR(20) spaces I wonder?

Barry

the standard parameter delimiter is '-'. '/' is MS "extensions" which
works only in DOS based systems. In all shells '-c <string>' can be
used to execute command specified in <string>. All other parameters
passed after <string> are parameters of executed command.

I guess that /home/baz/tmp/ahrl8i.sh contains some environment variables
settings. It will not work as you want for few reasons.
1. shell will try to execute above cArgs as single command and should show
   the message that such file does not exist. You should use "-c" switch
   before.
2. /home/baz/tmp/ahrl8i.sh does not have executable attribute so after
   fixing the problem in point 1 you will have message like:
   /home/baz/tmp/ahrl8i.sh: Permission denied
3. If you set executable attribute (point 2) then you exploit next problem.
   All environment variables set by /home/baz/tmp/ahrl8i.sh are local to
   /home/baz/tmp/ahrl8i.sh and are not visible for hbmk2 and its child
   processes. To resolve it you should not execute /home/baz/tmp/ahrl8i.sh
   as normal file but _include_ it to the current shell. Included files
   does not need executable attribute so you will not have to problem in
   point 2. To include file you can use "." command, i.e.:
      . /home/baz/tmp/ahrl8i.sh
   BTW the extension like .sh have no meaning in *nixes so you can ignore
   them.
   You can also remove "#!/bin/sh" from included files because "#" is
   used as comment (like REM in BATCH files).

In summary the final command should look like:

   cmd := 'sh -c ". /home/baz/tmp/ahrl8i.sh && hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp"'
   cmd += ' -q -trace -info -lang=en'
   HB_PROCESSRUN( cmd )

I do not know the QProcess parameters so I cannot tell you how exactly
it should look. Your comment above suggests that it should be enough
to make:
   cCmd := '/bin/sh'
   cArgs := '-c ". /home/baz/tmp/ahrl8i.sh && hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp"'
   cArgs += ' -q -trace -info -lang=en'

HTH,

best regards,
Przemek

Sorry, stupid typo, it should be:
   cCmd := '/bin/sh'
   cArgs := '-c ". /home/baz/tmp/ahrl8i.sh && hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp' + ;

Hi Pritpal,

Sorry. I was meaning:
When i activate via the "View" menu or the Toolbar: Dockable Widgets a form
(Documentation writer, Function list, Project properties, etc.) and i have
already another widget active, the created tab page don't gains focus. I
need to click on the label of the page wanted to edit. A bit annoying thing,
but not so important.

Sorry again... .fmg (form minigui). Ok, the file types would suffit, also if
a custom extension could be very useful.

Currently i have'nt installed xDevStudio. I'll make soon and I'll give you
some major specification.

No prebuilded action, but one or more edit boxes allowing to input the
wanted job.
Something similar to "User command" page in "Environment" setting of xMate,
as the attached screenshot.
Best would be to have more than one command per pre/post build (actually
xMate manages only one post build command).

I forgotten to ask you for the existence of "hbIDE environmental variables"
as in xMate: i.e. %NAME%, %PRG%, etc (see in the "Info" page in the
"Environment" setting of xMate. This would be necessary to parametrize the
pre/post command.

Waiting for your requests to better explain my thought.
Best regards.

Hi Przemek,
Thanks for your input - well explained as always!
I am struggling to follow your use of quotes in cArgs above.
Is that correct?

I have hacked the calling routine to test it and get:-

/bin/sh: ' -c . "/home/baz/tmp/5qwnv4.sh && hbmk2 
/home/baz/hash/ash.hbp' + ' -q -trace -info -lang=en "': No such file or 
directory

I can get this to run OK from the command line, but not yours.

sh -c ". /home/baz/tmp/test.sh && hbmk2 /home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q -trace 
-info -lang=en "

Note . is inside the quotes.

(temp.sh is similar to the other transitory scripts)

Rgds,
Barry

Hi Viktor

I use the preprocessor to produce two versions of a file, one which is my menu 
definition and one which is used to produce documentation. In my old make files 
I simply defined a rule to make the output.

Is there any similar possibility in hbmk2?

This is of the lowest possible urgency, and I well know your aversion to 
rewriting/reinventing make.

Thanks and regards

Message-ID: <15210137831.20100409163215@cxxl.de>

hi,

i used to do clipper summer 87.  now i ported to harbour and find that
@ get/read behaves slightly different under harbour.

1) @ get/read fields can not be confirmed with ctrl-enter (chr(10)),
only with enter (chr(13)).  clipper S87 will not exit the whole read
by pressing ctrl-enter, but at least lastkey() is set to 10 in a valid
function. 

2) ctrl-pgdn will not move the cursor to the last field (as in S87),
but will exit the whole read.

i would try to change that behaviour myself, but i don't know where to
start looking.

can anyone help?


proof of concept code:

   private x, y
   x = "123"
   y = "   "
   @ 0,0 get x valid showlast(0)
   @ 1,0 get y valid showlast(1)
   read

function showlast
   parameter r
   @ r,20 say lastkey() picture "9999"
return .t.

i not understad well your question
hbmk2 will use all flag of harbour
so for example  you can use /u<file.ch>

or better you can
/d<id>[=<val>]   #define <id>
preprocessor
and the #IF DEF inside your app

ome call to hbmk2 for each times

You are constructing wrongly.
Follow Przemek's input closely. Try this :

      ::oProcess:output      := {|cOut, mp2, oHbp| ::showOutput(
cOut,mp2,oHbp ) }
      ::oProcess:finished    := {|nEC , nES, oHbp| ::finished( nEC ,nES,oHbp
) }
      ::oProcess:workingPath := hbide_pathToOSPath( ::oProject:location )
      //
      cCmd := hbide_getShellCommand()
      cC   := iif( hbide_getOS() == "nix", "-c ", "/C " )

      IF hbide_getOS() == "nix"
         cArg := iif( empty( ::cBatch ), cC, cC + '".' + ::cBatch + " && " 
)
         cArg += cExeHbMk2 + " " + cHbpPath + cCmdParams + '"'
      ELSE
         *cArgs := '-c ". ' + /home/baz/tmp/ahrl8i.sh && hbmk2
/home/baz/hash/ash.hbp -q -trace -info -lang=en"'
         cArg := iif( empty( ::cBatch ), cC, cC + ::cBatch + " && "  )
         cArg += cExeHbMk2 + " " + cHbpPath + cCmdParams
      ENDIF
      //
      ::oOutputResult:oWidget:append( "batchfile = " + ::cBatch + iif(
hb_fileExists( ::cBatch ), " : Exists", " : Doesn't Exist" ) )
      ::oOutputResult:oWidget:append( "cCmd = " + cCmd )
      ::oOutputResult:oWidget:append( "arguments = " + cArg )
      ::oOutputResult:oWidget:append( hbide_outputLine() )
      //
      ::oProcess:addArg( cArg )
      ::oProcess:start( cCmd )

And let us know.

Perhaps not.

The reason is, we need to manipulate this mechanism 
on thread level, which, at this moment, is not mature unfortunately.
But I do not want to rob-off this possibility in any way.

Moreover, slots can be initiated per class instance basis 
which is a big productivity boost. In a super class we 
can initialize it without the intervention of the user and can 
designate a destructor and as such it will be managed by the 
class object.

Events, however, are different beast, have to be controlled 
centralized. But still in that case, I cannot imagine how we 
can attach to QApplication under the scenario it is 
implemented currently.

Yes, something like Massimo says.

Two hbmk2 calls in -hbraw mode plus -u and -o Harbour options.

I encourage you to follow Qt implementation from the very begining.
It was exactly how you want it. But perhaps you could not follow 
the whole picture. Read my reply to Viktor's message. It will clarify
the way I changed this whole mechanism.

Perhaps:
  VAR events // in QApplication
instead of:
  STATIC s_events

Former is much cleaner. QApplication class 
seems to be a requirement for any HBQT app 
so it seems doable.

Anyway just ignore this like most other 
suggestions from me. For me it's not a problem.

Brgds,
Viktor

Which Harbour revision you are using.
It has already been fixed a couple of days before.

Added .fmg. "Custome extension" wide opens the scope though I will think.

For this purpose you can use "Tools and Utilities" mechanism, 
it exposes much powerful features.

In practice, you never need to execute "post" actions with every
built. It is generally carried out once you are sure that edit/compile/link
cycles are upto production level. So, in my opinion, it must remain 
outside of the "build" process.

Oh, I thought you suggested on C++ level.
Yes, it is doable on TQApplication.prg level. I will try.

Or please tell us clearly why this is not possible... I believe Qt is
a great "framework", a lot more than a framework and your work (hbide
for example) shows how powerfull it is. And more, Qt is really
documented: web sites, books and a lot of source code available to
study on.... and it is a REAL PLUS for a harbour gui framework

But if hbqt deviates too much from standard Qt.... a lot of docs won't
match, code portability from c++ will not be easy....

...to add to my other reply (which is taking for ever to hit the list)
the above is missing a space after .
however with it there it still fails with same invalid option error from

thanks, but this will not fix my problem.

can someone test my program on clipper 5.2 and see how ctrl-enter and
ctrl-pgdn perform?

and, if 5.2 is performing differently than S87, can someone tell me
where to change this?

thanks.

It's a Harbour problem?

I'll use the available extensions.
BTW, custom extension was my need because i use a selfmade repository of the
application objects (in other words, a data driven engine) and i need to
include into the project the files containing the objects descriptors,
avoiding that hbIDE will compile it. I was ignoring that .xml, .ini and
other extensions was yet managed by hbIDE, so the problem don't exists.

You are right, in general way, but in my scenario could be fine if the
repository builder will be activated at the end of the prg compile and
before the exe is started, otherwise i'll have to do these steps:
1. compile the prg without launching the exe
2. launch my repository builder
3. launch the installer builder
4. upload to the web the installer
5. publish to the web the new version availability
6. launch the exe if needed
A very time expensive job. Now i manage this in a single click with xMate,
using the post build user command. In addition, xMate starts the command
only if the main build ends successfully, so your doubts about to start user
commands on inconsistent build are unapplicable.

This was also because i asked for the association of extension with a
command ( a la xDevStudio ), allowing that the builder will apply to
proprietary resouce files based on extension.
I realize it's my need, but could be an interesting feature is someone else
have similar problem (xml is largely used in data driven applications).

Best regards.
Maurizio

Hi Pritpal Bedi,


I study your ..\hbxbp\xbpdialog.prg

I think that  the  ::drawingArea := XbpDrawingArea():new(...)
Should be move from XbpDialog:create(...) into XbpDialog:new(...)

at-least when ::qtObject is empty ...

Because: 
      :
      oDlg:clipChildren := .T.
      oDlg:drawingArea:clipChildren := .T.             //  error still exist
at this line 
      oDlg:create()

Harbour is compatible with C87 just like C5x is compatible 
with it. Probably you're experiencing C5x vs. C87 incompatibility.
It's best to check it with real C5x compiler.

You can override the "GETSYS" subsystem. F.e. you take 
GETSYS.PRG shipped with C52 or C53, adapt it to your liking 
(f.e. by extending GetApplyKey() function) and link it to 
your app. You can do the same with tgetlist.prg which is 
part of Harbour.

Brgds,
Viktor

I'm 100% sure you can and this is the only 
"portable" way to solve it. This needs no 
special support in Harbour code.

F.e. on Windows: 'start help.chm'

How to change to specific topic? Well, look 
it up on the internet, it's not Harbour's job 
to support dead, platform specific formats 
natively.

Viktor

Is it not simpler to not limit extensions, just offer '*' / '*.*'?

IMO, adding user or 3rd party (non-free) specific extensions 
hard-wired into hbide (or any Harbour code) is very bad idea.

Of course another more complicated way is to make this configurable 
(f.e. via hbide.ini).

AFAIR this has been implemented, and now you can call 
'hbide my.hbp' to launch a project.

Adding necessary file type association is left as a job 
for users, as it's highly platform dependent and some 
users may not like such tampering in local environment.

Viktor

Try

and send me mail
executable created by clipper 87 (renaming exe or point via ftp) and source code

if you use internal inkey instead of k_value set by "inkey.ch" you

I'll investigate. Maybe the feature is yet available.
Any clue about how to implement the file association?

I agree with Francesco and Viktor. I hope I will use HBQt a lot.

Unfortunately not. I'd pick an open source tool 
which offers such feature and peek into its source 
to see how it's done.

Well, some googling revealed ASSOC and FTYPE commands.
Have a try with them.

It is possible, and with the current version you have.

1. Activate "Tools & Utilities" Dialog
2 Enter name : Chm Help with Chapter and Anchor
           Command Line : hh.exe
           Parameters: d:/hbide/hbide.chm::introduction.htm#mytest
3. <Add>, select and execute.

It does exactly what you want.
Now, how to invoke from within editor ( to be implemented ) :
   In the "Shortcuts" define one as

|cTopic|
IF( Empty( cTopic := ::GetText() ), cTopic := ::GetWord(.F.) ),
::exeTool( "hh.exe", "C:\xHB\Doc\xHarbour Language Reference Guide.chm" +
"::" + cTopic )

and it will execute. 

Just tested through "Tools & Utilities" interface and it works.

Subject: [Harbour] get/read compatibility with S87


hi,

i used to do clipper summer 87.  now i ported to harbour and find that
@ get/read behaves slightly different under harbour.

1) @ get/read fields can not be confirmed with ctrl-enter (chr(10)),
only with enter (chr(13)).  clipper S87 will not exit the whole read
by pressing ctrl-enter, but at least lastkey() is set to 10 in a valid
function. 

2) ctrl-pgdn will not move the cursor to the last field (as in S87),
but will exit the whole read.

i would try to change that behaviour myself, but i don't know where to
start looking.

can anyone help?


proof of concept code:

   private x, y
   x = "123"
   y = "   "
   @ 0,0 get x valid showlast(0)
   @ 1,0 get y valid showlast(1)
   read

function showlast
   parameter r
   @ r,20 say lastkey() picture "9999"
return .t.

I assume you have some framework in mind to achieve what you say.
Do you ? If yes, please post the code here for review and if the group 
agrees, we will follow that pattern. Also keep in mind that it must be 
backward compatible.

But if you expect this overhaul from me, I am sorry, I did my level
best to reach to this level and I know how much it is difficult to 
establish code flow to acheive final results something like hbIDE.

Alternatively, you can start parallel development on this segment 
and send the code here. I am sure someone more conversant with 
C++ will join this effort. For now I am only concentrated on hbIDE.

It is not a matter of influencing the decision, it is matter of 
writing some code in this direction.

Hi All,

> backward compatible.

I think until we have the basics right, it's not 
a reasonable goal to set current patterns or API 
in stone.

Unfortunately more and more code is created with 
current pattern, which makes it just more and more 
difficult to fix the basic problems in low-level 
code while keeping higher level code updated
(not to mention "invisible" for us code outside 
our SVN).

This has been exactly the problem I've been trying 
to shade a light on since many many months.

Bazaar is a nice thing, but if someone builds an Eiffel 
Tower on top of the bazaar, it's just not trivial 
to swap the foundation without troubling the Tower.

All this means that there is less and less chance 
(= more and more required effort) to ever make f.e. 
HBQT's memory management right, or to fix centralized 
slots system, just to name two crucial issues.

This in turn means that the original high expectations 
for HBQT becoming "the" GUI for Harbour are vanishing.

Given the effort put into this and the importance of 
a GUI in general, this is a pity.

It's my two cents.

Brgds,
Viktor

The idea of use existing source code of sample is intresting
the problem is how can be done without loosing existing code
How change hbqt code?
Can be resolved by preprocessor trip?

This is a problem for harbour that want use qt C++ class library
Similar problem will have also pyqt ?

Hi Antonio,

Thank you very much for your kind introduction e-mail, 
and very much so for the update work you've done on 
Harbour's wikipedia entry, I've just checked it, it's 
very good job. It finally looks professional.

You're welcome in the team.

Brgds,
Viktor

Will be possible use . istead : like visual fox pro?
 Xbase have added a /fox switch to the Xbase++ compiler to accept the
"." instead of the ":" in terms of OO syntax and will be become  VFP
successor.

I agree with all your assertions in toto.

But the bottom-line is, I am unable to find a solution
to coordinate when Qt destroys an object and when 
Harbour request it to destroy.

Unless someone more gifted join this effort,
like Istavin tried and offered some constructs, I do not 
see much progress. Time-and-again I try with a new 
concept, but at points it fails. The current implementation
is the best so far.

Easy to say it, but since you probably know the 
typical cases that need to be covered, so maybe 
it'd help to start off with a very limited set 
of wrappers, just to cook the right wrapping 
methods.

For sure you'll need to employ the concept of 
GC references. Without it, it will never be right.

It would also help just by itself, if you could 
create self-contained examples of the typical 
construct/destruct/detach/attach situations.

This would make it easy for everyone to experiment 
with it in a swift fashion (without dealing with 
the huge HBQT libs).

Just an idea.

Brgds,
Viktor

I had written, many years ago,  a few rules for PP translate some FoxPro

test this?

I could contribute these rules (and some code, I really can't remember how I
did) to FoxPro compatibility layer.

It is not easy to just start from small code.
Even to execute few lines, you need the full framework
working. The only change will be couple of classes to 
experiment instead of 302 we have at this time. 
And this does not make any difference either.

The point to emphasis is: if I write from scratch, I 
have to visualize the ways how the other way is, which 
after an year of heavy dwelling into exiting code fragmenents,
I find difficult if not impossible.  This type of approach 
is more suitable to one who starts afresh, has not any 
affinity to existing code. Whatever I will do will be influenced
by existing protocols. I may not be able to find another 
solution at all, and at the end, new code will look a shadow
of the original one. It is human nature and I am not the 
exception.

The biggest bug at present is object destructions and this 
part will be the last one if we develop another approach.
So we will come to know about whether we could resolve
this issue or not ? And what If we could not.

All other components are working perfectly all right so far.

In a nut-shell: someone with new thinking process has to 
step-in.

Hi Pritpal
I think that there is some misunderstanding... I'm not a native
english speaker so I may be confusing some time... I will try to be
more clear i n the future.

A bit about me: I was a programmer, up to about year 2000 my income
was from programming. No more. I only have one copy of a big
application running (started in 1986 in dBase III+) that I ported to
Harbour more for a personal pleasure than for a friend request
(friend, not client). So my point of view may be a bit different from
who uses harbour to earn a living.

I want to add that I spent really many nights on hwgui. I wanted to
use it for a small program I needed for my own use and found myself
involved in its development since I found more and more missing
bits... implementing activeX and filling the many missing bits in the
browse.... after months of work I didn't use hwgui as the "framework"
because I still fell is missing something.... and it misses the most
important part: there is NO documentation !

So when I read about hbqt I was curious, when I tried demoqt I become
interested and when I tried hbide I become "addicted" ! So I got a
couple of books from the many available on Qt and read them in a few
days. There are more than 20 books listed on Amazon !

So my brain started to think that Qt could solve all my need: a
multi-platform GUI, well documented, well developed, with lots of
goodies inside, with lots of sample code available, tutorials, faq,
etc... and most important to be used like an external library, a
black-box, something that I should not work on..... but nonetheless I
offered my help to trace the memory problem (till the comunication
stopped) because I "feel" that Qt and hbqt is the road to go !

Sorry for the long intro but I though it was due.

No, I don't have any framework in my mind... Qt is a framework for me.
I don't want to use hbxpp or hbqtcommand at the moment... I'd like to
use pure Qt.

Sorry, Pritpal, I don't have any code since I don't have any framework
in mind... or are you referring to the proposal to hide s_slots in the
code ? I think it is a bit too early for me to modify your code, I
have really basic knowledge about everything works... Infact I
proposed to put s_slots in c++ code and you said that - if I
understood correctly - this is not possible since multitasking
applications may have different s_slots lists... Viktor proposed to
hide s_slots as a VAR in QApplication (actually in TQApplication.prg)
but Qt docs says:
"For any GUI application using Qt, there is precisely one QApplication
object, no matter whether the application has 0, 1, 2 or more windows
at any given ...". I never used MT with harbour so I can't say more on
the subject...
>From what I understood from your message it seems that s_events is
unique and so it may be hidden inside harbour class QApplication. But
hiding in a VAR means you have this GC variable passed back and forth
in the calls... why not keep it in C++ code ? Totally handled by Qt ?

We all say thank you for your job, we are almost all programmers here
and we know and respect the work you put into hbqt and hbide. About
your idea of concentrating on hbIDE... I respect it but permit me to
not agree with you.... it seems to me like crossing a river during a
japanese tv game show... one of the stones may be fake and the runner
drop into the water...


To reach your level of knowledge it will take me more than a month,
too much to catch up, and I still miss all the harbour internals ! ...
so my proposal is that you shortly document in some way how all the
stuff is supposed to run, from a qB := QPushButton():new() to the
different cases of object destruction ( qB:destroy(), qB := NIL, qB
out of scope ). With this overview we have this benefits:
- everybody knows how it is supposed to work
- everybody can verify if it really works this way and propose
changes, for example Viktor that has a more in-depth knowledge of
harbour GC internals may spot some missing or inconsistent bits..

What do you think ?

In my opinion in makes a huge difference.

Currently any experimenting pass requires 
a huge amount of time (change generator, build 
generator, run generator, rebuild all HBQT libs), 
and finding out the exact root of any problem 
takes a huge amount of time as well, simple 
because of the amount of code involved. I know 
that because I tried it in the past.

Maybe you're right, but my impression is that you 
never really dwelled into the details we're currently 
discussing. At least not before implementing the 
whole heavy wrapper infrastructure. Hence my suggestion 
to step back and look at the thing, now that you know 
the perspective and the problems to look for.

[ It's also worth reading Przemek's last e-mail 
regarding the matter, as I'm almost sure there 
are actual answers hidden there. ]

I think you just can't state that. Object destruction 
to me looks like a symptom, not the root cause. IOW 
to make proper object destruction, you need more precise 
tracking of what to destruct and when, you also need 
to understand when and where things are _constructed_. 
For that you need additional logic at all involved 
points. (f.e. when assigning one object to another 
object var).

This puts HBQT in a risky position. Looks like nobody 
is interested to touch current large and heavy code.
If you have Przemek in mind (who surely could help), 
even to get his help, it would be much better to start 
off with something simple and up to the point. I think 
there is not much chance to expect from him to create 
a pret-a-porter commit for current huge codebase.

On a small example we could all understand the problems, 
find the principal solution and implement that solution 
on actual HBQT code. It won't be a one time commit.

At the same time you should stop masking found problems 
by workarounds, and instead mark all these problem 
parts with TOFIX markers with description of the problem.
(ideally this should be done for all past problems 
already masked)

Another thing which may help you move forward from 
current position is to install Linux (Ubuntu f.e.) 
in a VirtualBox (free) VM and experiment with HBQT 
and HBIDE. You will have the full power of valgrind, 
plus it's fun to check other platforms for real. 
It helped me a lot with hbmk2.

Brgds,
Viktor

Well, I don't say "professional, but it is better now. I am improving
http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projeto_Harbour now

I am having problems with a Wikipedian Prick on english version. He stating
about deleting Harbour article. When the article was weak, ugly and
incomplete, nobody shows to criticize it.

I got a dmoz.org editor account now. I will try improve Harbour web presence
in my spare time.

I am waiting my wikipedian stalker give up to continue my edits :-) But,
yes, your blog will be my target :-) Today I will edit pt version with
console/GUI drivers. I will use your blog as reference.

Today I asked Vailtom to allow me edit harbour-project.com.br in some way he
thinks ok.

I can help on portuguese, sorry to all. I think english should be a primary
source, but I can do a few with this language. I know my limitations.

Thanks. I will try Linux soon. This weekend I will try build Harbour64 on my
Windows and I will try Qt as static. I think all my big problems will be
build Harbour with external dependencies. Really external, not the
dependencies on /external folder in SVN, these are ok. And thanks to Viktor
to update them today.

I will try improve documentation too, but I can just do well in Portuguese.
I will be the boring guy to touch key of documentation.

Typical xbase programmers (not most of this list) have problems when they
documentation, imagine when he can't found documentation. I am not a very
expert on programming but I know fundamentals, I have experience with low
level programming and I worked with hundreds big companies and I am in
trouble to put my own Harbour build up and to understand some internals that
I will need work soon.

I know many Clipper programmers, I helped a lof of them and I am very proud
that all of them are better xBase programmer than the average. Some of them
never had heard on Harbour, some gave up Harbour after one failure (this is
a typical xBase programmer), and old Harbour versions helped build an image
of unprofessional plataform to migrate applications.

I feel that documentation and advocacy are very necessary. Even when I
dislike advocacy :-)

Thanks but I am just giving some thing back to all efforts that the team
have done to Harbour.

Again, sorry by my very strange english.

Fisrt, ^C Francesco words and ^V as my words :-)

I really hope HBQt comes to be the most important non-core Harbour
component. My decision about return to xBase programming was helped by HBQt
introducing, but today I couldn't put HBQt in my production code. IMHO HBQt
needed an overhauling to reach Harbour quality level.

HbIDE is a tool which I want work in future and I will post some suggestions
about it, but I think if HBQt have problems, HbIDE always will have problem.

Pritpal, I am pretty sure about difficulties to improve HBQt and about your
good work until now. I think that all of us are putting our trust in you to
lift HBQt to a place where it deserves be. I agree with Viktor when he says
today HBQt is a risky component to use.

And sorry if my english be confusing.

Well, we will have to play ball, WP has many rules and 
it serves the whole thing pretty well, so either we 
should talk with the guy and/or streamline the article to 
adhere with the requirements.

Reliable 3rd party references were missing, so I've added 
some hard statistics (now also an ohloh page).

We may also use citations from forums (clipper.borda.ru, 
hmgforum.com, pctoledo.com.br, comp.lang.clipper), and 
our own mailing list. F.e. there was great debate between 
Przemek and Xbase++ owner Steffen F. Pirsig:
   http://www.mail-archive.com/harbour@harbour-project.org/msg10164.html
   (and follow-up replies/corrections to this article)

Brgds,
Viktor

<ENGLISH>
First at all, you need a SVN client.

On Linux based OS you may install the "subversion" package using
the package manager.

On Windows here is a very good command line based SVN client:

http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads

Once that you have your SVN client installed, you just need to
do a checkout:

1. [optional] Create a "SVN" dir on your computer and change to it.

2. Execute the following command (is a single line):

svn co https://wxharbour.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/wxharbour/trunk/wxHarbour wxHarbour

3. Change to the "wxharbour" directory and just build the library
  & the samples.

Once that you have your SVN based wxharbour directory,
to update to last revision, you just have to execute on it:

svn update

</ENGLISH>

<SPANISH>

Una vez que tienes el cliente SVN instalado, solo necesitas efectuar

1. [opcional] Crea un directorio "SVN" y cambiate a el.

2. Executa el siguiente comando (es una sola linea):

svn co https://wxharbour.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/wxharbour/trunk/wxHarbour wxHarbour

3. Cambiate al directorio "wxharbour" y construye la libreria y
  ejemplos.

Una vez que tienes tu directorio SVN de wxharbour, para actualizar
a la ultima version, solo tienes que executar:

svn update

</SPANISH>

Hi  Bruno,

Please remakr the line of //include "appevent.ch"  or remove it


and please pay attention to the tst.hbp file

The line  -ld:\10\hprg\tgui.dll    ....

The path (d:\10\hprg\   should be the location of your disk and path of
tgui.dll )

3.) for the old version will showing the (dll and exe) not working error
     please pay attention to tst.hbp as follow: 

     The path (d:\10\hprg\   should be the location of your disk and path of
tgui.dll )

Some rules I've learned:
Mailing list can't be used as reliable source :-(
Non-english sources too

WP has so many rules, some of them are ambiguous and contradictory. It's
party to an "wikipedia's attorney" shows and make trouble where everything
walks ok.

You missed my discussion about newsgroup citation. He deleted the citation.
He shows me the rule. Ok. But I challenge him to deleted same source about
Linux History where Linus call for help on kernel development. He runs away.

The Harbour article have so many problems he not stated... The biggest
problem is he pick bureaucratic problems, not content problems.

If all WP rules going to be apllied the majority articles will be vanished
from WP.

Most of "Citation needed" was putted for me. The problem is get "reliable
sources" with so many rules. I am trying to make the article conform to WP
standards, have sure about that.

Yworo wants delete Harbour article in favor of xBase article. If Harbour
article is superfluous, thousands and thousands articles
are superfluous too, but this is not a argument, there is a rule denying
this type of argument. Nobody fix the same problem in "famous" articles
because there are too many "forces" to fight against.

In summary, who knows the WP process, knows WP is a place to people
expresses power. The majority WP rules are contrary to original intent of WP
when Jimbo creates it.

BTW, this post has the best value for me because I knew about the MT debate
:-) I think we need create an index to valuable posts like msg10164.

We should try. We have nothing to hide and we're 
not lying, so I believe all we need to do is put 
convincing sources behind our statements. F.e. the 
guy deleted the word "fast". Now, we have lots and 
lots of speed comparisons with Clipper, Xbase++ and 
xhb, so the back it up, we can just link to such 
a result posted on the mailing list. And see what 
happens.

In general I agree with the notion of backing up 
claims from as many (possibly external) sources as 
possible. Harbour is small community, so finding 
"external" source is not easy, so we should use 
what we have. F.e. you can quote speed comparison 
posted by xhb developers on xhb mailing list. F.e. 
this thread:
   http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.xharbour.devel/3012

It should be okay if linked through Google Translate.

I've also jumped to lots of links pointing to 
mail archives. Which means we should try and 
if the pointed article seems reasonable, I think 
it will be ok. We should see anyway.

> The Harbour article have so many problems he not stated... The biggest problem is he pick bureaucratic problems, not content problems.

Of course, because he probably uses some sort 
of automated tool to do rough verification on 
articles which received heavy changes in short 
time period. Such tool will look for keywords 
and hard rules which are just not noticed or 
enforced when coming in small steps. At least 
so I imagine.

> Yworo wants delete Harbour article in favor of xBase article. If Harbour article is superfluous, thousands and thousands articles are superfluous too, but this is not a argument, there is a rule denying this type of argument. Nobody fix the same problem in "famous" articles because there are too many "forces" to fight against.

So he should also delete Clipper, xHarbour, 
Xbase++ and FlagShip compiler articles as well.
This is plain nonsense, just ignore it, or point 
him these articles. A general xBase article 
is good idea, but the details are always put 
on distinct pages.

    - Deleted unused HBQT_DEBUG() macro. Pls use
      HB_TRACE( HB_TR_*, ... ) to make it obvious where trace
      calls are made. (Same should be done in HBXBP)

  * contrib/hbqt/THbQtUI.prg
    * Replaced static hbq_dbg() function with HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ... )
      calls. This makes sure that the trace call is dynamically
      toggled.

  * contrib/hbide/hbide.prg
    - Deleted __HBIDE_DEBUG__ forced define, which in turn
      forcefully enabled user-environment options HB_TR_DEBUG
      and HB_TR_WINOUT.
      I beg: Please set these on your local environment. That's
      the whole point of these settings. Unconditionally
      setting them in app code is not good idea.
      Go to Control Panel / System / Local environment and
      just add them there (if you need them) and case is closed.
      This should also fix excessive log output when simply 
      using HBIDE.

Please always post your samples with paths pointing to
/harbour/hbide/projects or one of its subfolders.
Do not expect us to create environment as per yours.

Now few observations:

1. You are linking with -shared flag, so you need harbourmt21.dll alongside
exe
2. If tst.exe is built with tgui.dll then it GPF's
3. If tst.exe is build without tgui.dll, including its source in same
project, tst.exe works,
   however, GPF at exit ( an issue we are onto resolving )
4. appevent.ch is a part of hbxbp lib and hence need not to be commented
out.

If linked with DLL and produces GPF, I think Przemek can extend help.

Teo, on an fresh installation of Ubuntu 10.04 32 bits, harbour Rev.
14306 and wxHarbour Rev. 574  from svn :

After installing this deb packages:

sudo apt-get install libwxbase2.8-dev libwxgtk2.8-dev wx-common

so i have a "wx-config --version" -> 2.8.10

Compiling with:

hbmk2 wxharbour.hbp

compile fine, then doing:

cd samples/dbf_ctrls1
hbmk2 ../../wxharbour.hbc dbf_ctrls1.prg
./dbf_ctrls1


Work fine... thank you

Best regards,
Marco

If oDlg:destroy() is called just before RETURN statement, it does not GPF.
And it must be called even as per Xbase++ specifications.

I agree although I think he is right. "Fast" is a very subjective concept.
It's possible give proofs about that, of course.

In general, it's not okay. And yes, WP has a lot of this citations.

He stalking Harbour article for now.
My idea is improving xBase article and left implementations details for
compilers and interpreters. But this require time. One thing to each time. I
can not get Harbour's article polished yet.

I am having problems with Dmoz too, but still trying. At least in that case,
Harbour is there already.

I will try to improve the criteria about TIOBE is indexing xBase languages.

Anyway I gave the kick off on english. My wish is "sell" harbour to
portuguese speakers. I can do a better job in my natural language.

It's in my TODO list ;-) but I can't do it alone.

BTW, I thinks it's off-topic but I am curious about past issues on Clipper's
and Harbour's history. I will start a new thread if nobody objects about
this a few OT.

Excuse my jump in and feel free to ignore everything.

For me WP should be only a place where to say that Harbour exist and
what it is while the "details and comparisons" should be elsewhere.

I understand that expression like "fast", "modern" or "unlike Java"
need to be proved and that a sentence like "Most softwares originally
writen to run on Xbase++, Flagship, FoxPro, xHarbour and others
dialects can be compiled with Harbor with some adaptation." can be
"critical". I've used FoxPro in the past and I can say that "some
adaption" is not the term I'd use for a conversion :)

Instead you could summarize the introduction leaving only the facts like:
...
Harbour is an open source computer programming language. The compiler,
the runtime and the support libraries are written in Ansi C and
Harbour itself so they can be built on every operating system that has
a compatible C compiler. Harbour is known to work under Microsoft
Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, BSD,  Windows CE, OS/2 Ecomstation,
Haiku/BeOS.

The open source Harbour license[1]  is similar to the GNU General
Public License, with an exception supporting commercial applications,
so commercial applications can be produced with Harbour and
distributed.
...

Concepts like "multiple graphic terminals" or "replaceable database
driver" are difficult to explain in few sentences and can be even
misleading so I would remove them.

In general I think you could present Harbour as a language by itself
instead of a Clipper clone. The vast majority of developers don't know
what Clipper is so references to it are almost useless.

Then you could add some code examples trying to make the code as clean
as possible starting with:

function main()
   outstd( "Hello World" )
return

I would avoid:

- mention macro
- things like ? or QOut
- terms like procedure or routine
- show both begin sequence and try catch syntax
- using DO <x>
- show DO CASE

Lorenzo

Message-ID: <1270928464013-4883224.post@n2.nabble.com>


Hello Viktor

hbIDE run from console window which is used to compile/link/run under
development.
NOTE: this I am doing since very begining I started on hbQT+.
hbMK2 executes properly and builds the targets ok.
But since yesterday night I "Build and Run" feature of hbIDE produces this
log.
Strange part is that if I run same hbIDE.exe from desktop icon and execute 
"Build and Run" it works perfectly. Probably this may lead us to detect 
why on *nixes the same operation fails.

Below are logs from hbIDE invoked from the development console and from
desktop.

Two builds were just to check if .bat is unique to both of them.

So what should I look into or what has changed in hbMK2 recently ?

Gracias Teo, ya pude bajar los funtes del SVN, sin embargo, aun no he 
podido generar la LIB y por ende los ejemplos.
Solamente he bajado e instalado esto:

luego compilo con esto:

Looking at the outputs hbmk2 can hardly be at fault 
here, as it's just not even executed in your first 
two examples. I can't cite any hbmk2 changes that 
could cause such error.

Moreover I've experienced exactly like this months 
ago, when I tried to build anything from HBIDE. 
(I was running HBIDE from Far Manager cmd prompt).
I can't remember much more detail about it though.

First I'd completely avoid the '&&' trick. I think 
it's unnecessary complication, and it'd be much 
cleaner to create a .bat with all the stuff to be 
executed and simply call the .bat file without 
any tricks. To help to see what really gets executed, 
you can dump the content of the .bat file to the 
log window.

The other thing I'd check is FERASE(). I remember 
that it fixed my problems.

Brgds,
Viktor

I disagree although the article need be cleaned up. I bring a lot things
from Clipper and xHarbour article to be polished.  It's a matter of balance
and you can contribute on article It is not mine.
Look at another programming languages articles about details.

I agree, It is not my text. Feel free to change it. You can discuss about
that on WP too. Some WP editors don't read this mailing list.

It's not my text but I think this is need be better written. We can't hide
this information too.

My main goal is done: shaking the list about the subject.

Anyway, feel free to change the article.

Personally I code in C style. A typical Clipper programmer
don't recognize my code as xBase program. Unfortunately we still need "sell"
Harbour to Clipper programmer. I repeat, this view is going against my
personal preference but I think it is necessary comparing old (dBase) style
to new (Harbour) style.

Thanks to your suggestions.

Seems that you aren't yet builded the wxWidgets library, you just downloaded it.

In order to build wxWidgets you need to execute the following:

I have seen now news from online newspapers after read messages in the list.
I'm deeply sorry too.
Best wishes to Polish friends.

Subject: [Harbour] My first study on hbqt code...
Message-ID: <l2k6943770e1004101644w34c8b444sc7839f0feba93da3@mail.gmail.com>

Let's start with

"qtgui/QPushButton.cpp"

HB_FUNC( QT_QPUSHBUTTON_SETAUTODEFAULT )
{
   hbqt_par_QPushButton( 1 )->setAutoDefault( hb_parl( 2 ) );
}

Since
#define hbqt_par_QPushButton( n )                   ( ( QPushButton
             * ) hbqt_gcpointer( n ) )

this line:
hbqt_par_QPushButton( 1 )->setAutoDefault( hb_parl( 2 ) );
becomes:
( ( QPushButton * ) hbqt_gcpointer( 1 ) )->setAutoDefault( hb_parl( 2 ) );

In "hbqt_destruct.cpp" there is hbqt_gcpointer(). Its job is to return
the pointer to the object.

For every Qt object hbqt actually stores a struct, and in pq member it
stores a "guarded pointer" that is binded to the object at creation
time. A guarded pointer is a special pointer that is guaranteed to
became NULL if the binded object is deleted. QPointer may only be
created for objects descending from QObject.

Guarded pointers are important since (from what I understood from my
readings) there are many different possibilities for object
destruction, for example using MT, where a thread can delete an object
while another is updating it...

In the objects destructor ( the hbqt_gcRelease_* functions ) pq value
is checked against NULL... But in hbqt_gcpointer it is not... because
in hbqt_gcpointer we just have a "generic" QGC_POINTER and not the
"specific" QGC_POINTER_QPushButton so pq is not "available"...
See:
typedef struct
{
   void * ph;
   bool bNew;
   QT_G_FUNC_PTR func;
   QPointer< QPushButton > pq;
} QGC_POINTER_QPushButton;

typedef struct
{
  void * ph;
  bool bNew;
  QT_G_FUNC_PTR func;
} QGC_POINTER;

My idea is then to add a Qpointer placeholder in QGC_POINTER but it
would need some more changes, infact it seems ok for objects in
directory qtgui (they descend from QObject) but not for objects in
qtcore that doesn't inherit from QObject.

So there are 2 possibilities to verify:

1) in hbqt.h change the #define hbqt_par_QPushButton( n )   ( (
QPushButton  * ) hbqt_gcpointerFromQObject( n ) ) for object in qtgui
and then copy hbqt_gcpointer to hbqt_gcpointerFromQObject adding pq
checking (the some for *FromObj) but then how to handle Q_release ?

2) using bNew not as a bool but as a bitmask with values
1=CREATED_BY_NEW 2=HAS_PQ 4=INVALID 8=DELETE_IN_PROGRESS (to
trap/debug strange interactions between c++ delete and harbour GC)
giving us a clear picture of what is happening and also a lot more
"status" bit to use

Using 2) it may be just a matter of adding the status bit at object
creation and checking the 1-ness of bit 2 before testing pq and some
other trivial changes...

Just after hitting Send I went back to QPointer description and I saw this:
     QPointer<QLabel> label = new QLabel;
     label->setText("&Status:");
     ...
     if (label)
         label->show();

QPointer can be used in place of the object it points to...

So there may be a point 3)

change the way we create the QPointer now, assigning the original
pointer to pq (or other member of different name to not confuse) and
assign the QPointer to ph.
In this way we should get an auto-consistent, unified way to handle ph...

Pritpal can you please add a HB_TRACE on entering hbqt_gcAllocate_*
with bNew value ?

This line will match the "closing"
HB_TRACE( HB_TR_DEBUG, ( "PTR_rel_*    :    Object not created with new()" ) );
that show up in the trace without the corresponding "opening"

Perhaps the text "Object not created with new()" may be changed to
something like:
Object not created with bNew=true

After checking the wxharbour.hb? files, I see that they are building/linking
against the NON-UNICODE version of the wxWidgets library.

So please change in the above commands the clause:

-----------------
UNICODE=1

to

UNICODE=0
-----------------

This in order to use the current wxharbour.hb? files in SVN.


Important: Also you need to set the HB_WITH_WX var to something like

set HB_WITH_WX=C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\include


After following the above steps, the library & samples are builded ok by
using the hbmk2 utility with the wxharbour.hb? scripts.


best regards,

Teo

Subject: [Harbour] hbmk2: expanding env vars on windows
Message-ID: <F8DF597C-FEE5-49F9-95C8-179789E3FB1D@windtelsoft.com>

Hello,

On an *.hbc script, there is the following line:

-i{mingw}${HB_WITH_WX}\..\lib\gcc_lib\msw


If I set the HB_WITH_WX var with:

set HB_WITH_WX=C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10

then it's incorrectly expanded to:

-LC:/lib/gcc_lib


If I set the HB_WITH_WX var with:

set HB_WITH_WX=C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\include

then it's correctly expanded to:

-L"C:/wxWidgets-2.8.10/lib/gcc_lib"



It's correctly behavior ? If so, why ?


best regards,

Teo

If I understand correctly (correct me if not):

- You intend to create separate hbqt_gcpointer*() calls for 
each object type.
- To add NULL checking to these functions.

I agree with both. HBQT code should definitely throw RTE when 
NULL is detected, instead of letting it GPF.

May be good, but I can't oversee this one.

No,  my proposal 1) has just 2 functions, one hbqt_gcpointer for Qt
objects that don't have pq and one hbqt_gcpointer_has_pq for objects
that have one... Proposal 2) keeps only one function but uses bNew to
store if pq is valid or not. Proposal 3) stress it more using QPointer
in place of ph to streamline some routine...

Yes. But Pritpal says that we don't have such cases and the problem is
only in destructor... Infact I proposed that bNew status bits to
better trace what happens...

-------------------------------

I was also thinking about the possibility of eliminating all the
QGC_POINTER_Q* structures at all and just use QGC_POINTER but with the
addition of pq and bNews used as status... It would add 4 bytes to
each Qt object

All QGC_POINTER_Q* I examined are equal to QGC_POINTER or to
QGC_POINTER plus pq member... I only don't know if it is possibile to
have a "generic" definition
 QPointer< * > pq;

So I believe that each QGC_POINTER_Q* that has no pq member can become
a QGC_POINTER, while for the others that have the pq member a C++
expert should tell if QPointer< * > pq; is supported.

I found also a case where QGC_POINTER_QHttpResponseHeader is defined,
but a standard QGC_pointer is used....

So such change can do no harm and should be done 
to prove this statement of Pritpal and avoid any 
future misunderstandings in this regard.

But, I doubt current situation is clean. To me this 
little code shows a clear GPF situation, when no, or 
wrong 1st parameter is passed to this function:

HB_FUNC( QT_QPUSHBUTTON_SETAUTODEFAULT )
{
   hbqt_par_QPushButton( 1 )->setAutoDefault( hb_parl( 2 ) );
}

NULL check seems clearly required, otherwise '->' 
may just fail.

Yes. Plus check TOFIX notes in HBQT code, and it's 
worth to carefully read Przemek's recent quick summary 
of HBQT problems, there are some important issues 
raised there which may help finding the right direction.
(f.e. confusing/mixing raw pointers with GC collected 
ones, which is another clear GPF situation).

Viktor

Hello All

Is this the correct way to build fully qualified path given a file in
current folder, for *nixes ?
On Windows it works perfect.

hb_curDrive() + hb_osDriveSeparator() + hb_osPathSeparator() + CurDir() +
hb_osPathSeparator() + cMyFile.ext

I'm not sure why you need it, but the best (and only portable!) 
way to refer to file in current drive/dir, is just to not use any 
absolute path at all, IOW:
   cMyFile.ext

Any other solution has problems.

Viktor

This is what I suspected.
The question was of cosmatic importance.

Subject: [Harbour] Installation of hbide
Message-ID: <276471.19743.qm@web28502.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi!

I installed Harbour on my Ubuntu 9.10 64-bit.
I followed the instructions 
http://www.elart.it/links/harbourhowto_deb_en.php

Everything was going well, except installation of hbide.
I typed 
cd $HOME/src/contrib/hbide 
bud the directory did not exist.
Then I realized that there is a directory $HOME/src/harbour/contrib/hbide
 I typed
cd $HOME/src/harbour/contrib/hbide
 and then
hbmk2 hbide.hbp -rebuild
but I have got an error message:

Then I tried ./hbide but the file did not exist.

Does anybody have any suggestions how to install hbide?

Thanks in advance for
 your help.

Yes there seems to be a problem with the current build since yesterday.
If you move into /contrib and issue:-
svn co -r 14262 
https://harbour-project.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/harbour-project/trunk/harbour/contrib/hbide
to revert to version 14262 that's a few days old, then:-
cd hbide
hbmk2 hbide.hbp
It should build OK - it did for me.

Hi Francesco,

Maybe it'd be a good idea to also add similar traces to 
hbqt_gcpointerFromItem(), hbqt_pPtrFromItem() and hbqt_pPtrFromObj() 
function.

Seems to be working OK.
Compiles fine but I did not check with "DEBUG" trace,
though I do not feel there would be problem.

Can you remove hb_getMemUsed() calls from hbide.prg also ?
My setup is in indifferent state per hbIDE and cannot commit 
as a part.

Can you change 
         cC   := iif( hbide_getOS() == "nix", "-c ", "/C " )
to 
         cC   := iif( hbide_getOS() == "nix", "-c .", "/C " )

and try again?

Hi

Rc compiler will have /nologo param only in next version in  VS2010.

Rather to:
   cC   := iif( hbide_getOS() == "nix", "", "/C " )

An .sh file is not a command, so -c is just not needed 
there.

Viktor,

Seems that "rc.exe" hasn't a "-nologo" parameter.

Can I safely remove that in the "config/win/msvc.mk" file at SVN ?

Hi,

Yes, so delete HB_COMPILER setting to let the build 
system autodetect your compiler plus version.

Or set compiler version manually.

Nothing personal, but I'd like to ask mailing list 
participants to read the e-mails coming to the list. 
It's pretty inefficient to explain the same thing 
every second/third day. I update INSTALL doc, which 
always has correct and up to date information, so 
pls read it if messages were missed.

And to reiterate: I recommend everyone to delete 
HB_COMPILER setting _now_. It's not needed in 99% 
of cases.

Brgds,
Viktor

I just did, and I'm a little confused here:

I have (in the same Windows machine) several C/C++ compilers:

- MSVC ( 8 & 9 versions )
- MinGW
- BCC
- OpenWatcom

If I remove the HB_COMPILER option then the build process at
Harbour detects the compiler as MinGW.

So in my case, I have to manually set  the HB_COMPILER option.



The file at "config/win/msvc.mk" says:

ifeq ($(filter $(HB_COMPILER_VER),600 700 710 800 900),)
   RCFLAGS += -nologo
endif

So, what value I have to give to HB_COMPILER_VER to
do not execute the "RCFLAGS += -nologo" ?



best regards,

Teo

So set it, and also set HB_COMPILER_VER accordingly. 
It's always a good practice if you want to make sure 
proper build options are used by Harbour build process 
and hbmk2. There is no way to make up a default which 
works properly for everyone.

I'd however not recommend keeping that many tools 
in the PATH at the same time. It can be source of 
many strange build errors, even with Harbour. It's 
also a basic recommendation in INSTALL. BTW this 
rule applies even more so for other 3rd party 
package, so it's not a Harbour thing or my invention.

Locally I use small batch files to setup the environment
for the compiler I'd like to use at any moment, f.e.:
'mi hbmk2 hello.prg', to select mingw and build something.

Next time there might be other options which depend 
on compiler version, so I don't want to remove this.

At least the problem isn't hidden now.

Thank you, this solved my problem:

I was keeping in the path the C:\MinGW\bin directory
in order to find the MinGW make utility (now contained
in the Harbour tree).


Thanks again for the explanation.

Hi

I had the same problem. 
Multiple configurations - msvc and mingw  and c:\mingw\bin in path. (for
mingw32-make)
So autodetection didn't work.
And the same was with:
 SET HB_COMPILER=msvc
 SET HB_COMPILER_VER=800

Both variants work now when i removed mingw path.

Sorry, but I can't follow what you did. If you 
specify above two settings, it should work regardless 
of mingw being also in PATH.

In my local tests everything works as expected, 
msvc compiler selected, -nologo switch controlled by 
version, with or without mingw.

BTW, maybe it's useful information for someone, 
but -nologo is also supported by rc.exe (v6.1.7600.16385) 
packaged with Win SDK 7. I can just recommend this 
package over MSVS 2008.

Brgds,
Viktor

Subject: [Harbour] hbIDE - Keyboard Shortcuts - Behavior Overview
Message-ID: <1271009375772-4886460.post@n2.nabble.com>


Hello Everybody

Ground is ready to launch "Keyboard Shortcuts" in hbIDE.

Before I end-up in a mess I need group opinion as to how 
user-defined or user-altered definitions should behave.

Current implementation is like:

Keyboard shortcut is only defined for menu options. 
Toolbar icons do not consider them.
Defined with menu option ensures that those can be activated from anywhere
in hbIDE.
Some actions are defined only for active editor instance a

Now if user alters one, say, CTRL+D ( Duplicate Line ), to something
DeleteLine(),
how it should be treated? Note that once defined as with menu option, such 
action cannot be intercepted from within editor instance.

One option could be, do not define any "shortcut key" with menu option, only
show 
it with menu prompt text, and intercept the same in editor instance. And
this makes
the engine really robust. Note: action will always be carried as is if menu
option is clicked.

The second option could be, change the menu prompt and attch new definition
user has altered.
This will make menu options always inconsistent.

I would prefer the first option.

Another options you are to suggest.

No apologies for posting the whole output as it's been a long time coming!

This is a non-GUI app and when built with the "build and launch" button 
the output adds:-

Launching application [ /home/baz/hash/ash ]

... but nothing further - I don't know if this is correct in this situation.

Well done everyone !

Hi Pritpal,

I've found that you've decided to replicate complete 
help texts of hbmk2, harbour, xpp.exe and alink.exe 
hard-wired inside HBIDE source code.

While the latter two may well violate copyrights, it's 
even not a good idea to replicate external tool help 
text like that in HBIDE code for Harbour's own utilities. 
The smaller problem is that it doesn't honor translations, 
the bigger is that it may be off compared to the actual 
version of hbmk2 / harbour being used. IOW it breaks 
separation of layers and responsibilities.

Please remove them and just call these tools with 
"--help" or equivalent help option to query help text and  
present the output to users.

Brgds,
Viktor

I kept it here for reference sake to build some 
type of user interface, i.e, which type of input method
be used if an option is a part of UI.

Since I am not at this topic yet, it can be deleted.
I will do it in next commit.

So we succeeded, at last.

Thanks Viktor for pointing to keep everything in.sh/.bat and above tip.
Thanks Przemek for understanding how bash commands work.

It should launch theoretically.
But let us examine how I am initiating the launch.

      #if 1
      qProcess := QProcess():new()
      qProcess:setWorkingDirectory( hbide_pathToOSPath(
oProject:wrkDirectory ) )
      IF !empty( oProject:launchParams )
         qStr := QStringList():new()
         qStr:append( oProject:launchParams )
         qProcess:startDetached_1( cTargetFN, qStr )
      ELSE
         qProcess:startDetached_2( cTargetFN )
      ENDIF
      qProcess:waitForStarted()
      qProcess := NIL

      #else

Please investigate. It is straight forward. 
Somewhere we are missing how should we pass the params to QProcess().

Thank you.

Three more issues (sorry to plug it like that, but I've 
stumbled upon them at this second):

1. "Path to hbmk2" is ignored in Compiler Environments.
   Started off HBIDE with default settings, opened hbide.hbp, 
   build obviously didn't work, so I set above option, and 
   nothing changed when clicking "Build".
2. In 'Compiler Environments' is says 'Save and Exit', 
   while it should really say 'Save and Close'.
   There are other panels/dialogs with this same problem.
3. Envvar HBIDE_DIR_HBMK2 is also ignored.

Brgds,
Viktor

METHOD IdeProjManager:launchProject( cProject, cExe )
needs to be overhauled as it is Windows centric anyway.
Because passed parameter is not having ".exe" as extnsion,
nothing has hapened. Please check.

Accidentally I've stumbled upon new code to detect 
executable name, and it's not right. First of all 
"hbmk2: Linker command:" text is only shown when 
-trace mode is used, second, there is no guarantee 
that '-o' option is used in all supported target 
compilers, this is not true even with current set 
of compilers.

Brgds,
Viktor

Any number of times.
We all are working hard for some goal and every bit 
of participation is highly welcome.

I had some issues regarding this when I was experimenting,
now possibly lot have changed, let us do it once more.
If I remember correctly, it had been HB_COMPILER something 
issue then.

Fixed.
Please point-out other areas.
When you are doing quick, you tend to do mistakes.

Please read answer to #1.

I know this fact.
But am short of insight how effectively should I detect it.
Please tweak with this issue, if possible.

I don't understand that answer. What does this have 
to do with HB_COMPILER? I'm trying to find it, but 
there is a huge forest of classes and I can't easily 
oversee them. Simply the path is not used when 
forming hbmk2 executable name.

Let us re-introduce it.
Can you test after  changing line 1236

    cExeHbMk2  := "hbmk2"   /* Needs that path is already set before calling
hbmk2 */
=>
    cExeHbMk2  := ::oProject:cPathMk2 + "hbmk2"

I hit another problem trying to test with a simple "Hello World" project.
I have seen this before but was waiting until other issues were fixed.

On attempting to add a second project to hbide, either by creating from 
scratch, or using an existing .hbp, this array bound error crashes hbide.

http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n287/barjac_2006/hbide10.png

My ash project does not run now - I suspect a change in Harbour in the 
last few days has broken it as it has always been OK.

Error DBCMD/35  Workarea not in use: __DBLOCATE
Called from __DBLOCATE(0)
Called from INTVAR(401)
Called from MAIN(195)

It's a very simple early routine that opens a .dbf, locates some data 
and closes it again, before main system is up and indexes opened etc.

399 FUNCTION intvar
400 USE company
401 LOCATE FOR co = "ZZ"
402 IF FOUND()
403    zco = cmpny

I see you have committed the fix and also auto-detection of exe.

First, do not mix two issues in one thread, open another.

Can you guard idehome.prg#368 

      aadd( aHtm, '    ' + dtoc( dir_[ 1,3 ] ) + " " + dir_[ 1,4 ] )

with

      if ! empty( dir_ )
         aadd( aHtm, '    ' + dtoc( dir_[ 1,3 ] ) + " " + dir_[ 1,4 ] )
      endif 

Infact I know nothing about how things happen on *nixes.

That worked - sort of, but it seems not to save the second project 
properly between runs, and mixes displayed info from one project in the 
other, so I now have just one very simple project to test this problem.

Typo :-)

Looks correct.

There is no more output in the console though.

On command line in hbhello:-

[baz@jackodesktop hbhello]$ ./hellotest

Hello World

or from anywhere :-

[baz@jackodesktop ~]$ /home/baz/hbr/hbhello/hellotest

Hello World

How is current directory set?

I have yet another proposal:
in QGC_POINTER_* a new member should be added, call it "fingerprint".

Every QObject should be issued a different "fingerprint", let's say
QApplication is 1, QPushButton is 2 and so on.
So when we get somehow a QGC_POINTER_* we can get back it's c++ class...
hbqt_gcpointer may accept as second parameter the fingerprint of the
requested object and RTE if not matched.... it may be 0 to not do any
check...

typedef struct
{
   void * ph;
   bool bNew;
   QT_G_FUNC_PTR func;
   QPointer< QPushButton > pq;
   long fingerprint;
} QGC_POINTER_QPushButton;

   p->bNew = bNew;
   p->func = hbqt_gcRelease_QPushButton;
   p->fingerprint = 2 ;

...
#define hbqt_par_QPushButton( n )                   ( ( QPushButton
             * ) hbqt_gcpointer( n ) )
becomes
#define hbqt_par_QPushButton( n )                   ( ( QPushButton
             * ) hbqt_gcpointer( n , 2 ) )

and hbqt_gcpinter is amended as necessary.

It must be said that hbqt_gcpointer is allways called via the previous
defines. Only in hbqt_destruct.cpp is called directly twice with -1
and a couple of times with iParam...

Let me _repeat_ again:

Problem is not with functioning of the objects,
that is working perfect. It lies when object is _destructed_
by Qt and when Harbour tries to _free_ the pointer.

This is the scenario we should base our findings...

    oWnd contains oPushButton, oMenu's and lot other controls - comples 
    parent child hirarchy. Now suppose oWnd goes out of scope, Harbour 
    schedules garbage collection and it is not know in what order it will 
    release the variables. Assume, oWidget is released first which contains
    many others. Our destructor will be called which in turn will issue 
    delete ( QWidget * ) p->ph . The request will reach Qt GC ( they may
call is 
    with another name ) and Qt deletes oWidget and, by its way of
handellings,
    Qt will also delete all childeren. The pointers held in Harbour GC of
those 
    children are still there to be released as per same cycle. And voila
GPF, because
    those are already been freed by Qt.

    If you study hbXBP, I have implemented object destruction very
carefully.
    Child first, parent next. That is why oDlg has ever to be issued
:destroy()
    method which does not leave anything for GC to free them in arbitratory
    fashion.

    The whole point os distability is the way we need to handle destruction.

Hope this info may prove helpful to hit the right solution.

You tried with hbIDE ?

If yes, please note that it is now optimized to destroy objects
in proper way. There are a couple of places I know, but even 
they are OS dependant. BTW which compiler and OS you are 
trying with ?

Perfect, this is exactly what Qt documentation says. This is normal.
And I checked this via the trace logs.

This should only happen if in this hierarchy there are objects without
QPointer...  if all objects have QPointers then there is something
wrong... If there are objects that are not deriving from QObject so
that they can't have QPointer (is it ever possible for display classes
????) I agree with you that this doing a recursion and deleting
objects ourself is the only way.... unless we overload the delete
operator, take the pointer value, lookup the address (via an HASH ???)
and discover the QGC_POINTER_* whose ph is equal to the pointer value.

in pseudo-code,
in hbqt_gcAllocate_*
  hash[ p->ph ] = p

in  the overloaded delete:
  if ( t := hash[ ptr ] ) {
     t->ph := 0;
     remove hash[ ptr ];
  }

If you accept my first idea to change bNew in a bitmap "status" you can
 t->bNew |= QT_DELETED ;

In this way you should not care about object destruction order....

Tried through which program ? 
hbIDE ? demoXBP ? demoQT ? Or your own demo application ?

Plus your results may not match ours because we still use 4.5.3
as announced in INSTALL.

We can overload new() and delete() operators.
Read previsous messages and flag -hbnocppmm to hbMK2.

How you can do so:

1. Put following code in cppstub.cpp and add to hbide.hbp

   const char * __hbmk2_hbcppmm( void )
   {
      return "HBCPPMM";
   }
   int getnew( void )
   {
      static int i = 0;
      return ++i;
   }
   int getdelete( void )
   {
      static int i = 0;
      return ++i;
   }
   void * operator new( size_t nSize )
   {
      if( nSize == 0 )
      {
         nSize = 1;
      }
      void * ptr = hb_xgrab( nSize );
HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ( "                new(  %p ) %i  %i", ptr, nSize,
getnew() ) );
      return ptr;
   }
   void operator delete( void * ptr )
   {
      if( ptr )
      {
         hb_xfree( ptr );
HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ( "<      delete( void * %p ) %s  %i", ptr, "        
0", getdelete() ) );
         ptr = 0;
      }
   }

2. Build hbide as hbmk2 hbide.hbp -hbnocppmm
3. Then follow the tracelog.

Hopefully you will understand how delete() is called.
You will also be surprised to know that new() is always called 
but delete() is only called for non-QObject derived objects, 
and that too are missing sometimes.

First link I studied at when we started this project.
It gave me wider insight into the subject, though today
I got one more tip: destroyed() signal. I will check how
it can be exploited, though, the same functionality 
is achieved with p->pq already.

2nd link I never read but it has little for us.
BTW as many links about Qt destruction mechanism state 
the complexity of approach trolltech adopted in this regard.
Every binding is in trouble.

This is a basic feature of our GC allocator. Current 
problem is that all objects use one common GC 
allocator, with one commno fingerprint.

That's why reference counting was invented, and the problem 
is that it's not used by HBQT.

Any contrib is fine besides HBQT.

F.e.:
   contrib\hbpgsql\postgres.c

The fingerprint is the handler callback 
passed to hb_gcAllocate() functions as 
2nd parameter.

hbcairo.

Check with 'grep hb_gc *'

Sorry, I did not make myself clear. It is the compilation conditional based on 
the time of the source file changing which I wish to exploit (like any make tool).

Note that I only ask if some such feature already exists in hbmk2 since you 
(Viktor) obviously similar with -inc.

That's even worse than handling everything as the base class.

First I think we need to make sure we can identify the 
class of every GC allocated objects. If we can do this, 
we may make the next step and properly filter accepted 
parameters. For this we also need to maintain the layout 
of the QT class hierarchy. This raises other issues, like 
how to keep this in sync with QT version. This information 
BTW is already maintained in HBQT on the .prg level.

So you could make sth like:

HB_FUNC( QT_SOME_METHOD )
{
   if( hbqt_par_isQPUSHBUTTON( 1 ) )
      ... pass the call to QT...
}

or

HB_FUNC( QT_SOME_METHOD_2 )
{
   if( hbqt_par_isQCONTROL_or_descendant( 1 ) )
      ... pass the call to QT...
}

Another random thought: Maybe it would be worth to 
investigate if it would be useful to merge current 
separate .prg level HBQT class wrappers with low-level 
method implementations on the .cpp level.

In Harbour it's possible to create classes purely in .c/.cpp 
code, so this may give performance and may help maintaining 
the whole thing. (see src/rtl/errapi.c)

BTW, if we could properly identify object types, current 
hack of method overloading on the wrapper level could also be 
change for a better solution. I mean code like this:
---
HB_FUNC( QT_QTRANSLATOR_TRANSLATE )
{
   hb_retc( hbqt_par_QTranslator( 1 )->translate( hbqt_par_char( 2 ), hbqt_par_char( 3 ), hbqt_par_char( 4 ) ).toAscii().data() );
}

HB_FUNC( QT_QTRANSLATOR_TRANSLATE_1 )
{
   hb_retc( hbqt_par_QTranslator( 1 )->translate( hbqt_par_char( 2 ), hbqt_par_char( 3 ), hbqt_par_char( 4 ), hb_parni( 5 ) ).toAscii().data() );
}
---
(though in this specific case it could be fixed easily even now)

Just thoughts.

I'm also forwarding this to mailing list in the hope to 
ignite interest in other contributors.

Brgds,
Viktor

It's not a different situation from c++...

If you do this, you need to implement and mantain a class hierarchy in
the code, checking ancestors for every access. And since every Gui
object . Probably as first step we may differentiate between
"base-classes": this will avoid some class of problems....

Also, we must keep in mind how some methods are redefined....
Example from QRadioButton....
14 protected functions inherited from QAbstractButton
37 protected functions inherited from QWidget
7 protected functions inherited from QObject
1 protected function inherited from QPaintDevice

If I call qRB:height() actually is called a QWidget:height() that is:
RETURN Qt_QWidget_height( ::pPtr ) that is: hb_retni(
hbqt_par_QWidget( 1 )->height() );
and  hbqt_par_QWidget( 1 )  becomes, in a "strict" type checking as
per my (unpublished) proposal: hbqt_par_QWidget( 1,
&pointer_to_qwidget_destructor )... since ::pPtr was created by
QRadioButton, hbqt_par_QWidget will return NULL....

In hbqt_par_QWidget( 1, &pointer_to_qwidget_destructor ) we may
implement hierarcht knowledge, or via an iterator (going up the
hierarchy until no more items or an item is found) or via a hasehd
table...

Yes, it may be a next step.

Yes, it is, not completely but it is.  (BTW: muliptle inheritance is
possible in harbour ?)

low-level method implementations can be merged, and it would be good
to make them static (calling them directly is a way to problems). But
some hbqt_gcAllocate_Q* functions are called from other objects and so
they can't be hidden...

I saw a library where c code was included in a prg file by a #pragma...

There are easy and not easy solutions, at both c++ and prg code
level.... In some objects there is already a form of constructor
overriding, as in QRadioButton,
in other similar cases there is no overriding (QPushButton has 3
constructor)....

   if( HB_ISCHAR( 1 ) )
      pObj = ( QRadioButton* ) new QRadioButton( hbqt_par_QString( 1
), hbqt_par_QWidget( 2 ) ) ;
   else
      pObj = ( QRadioButton* ) new QRadioButton( hbqt_par_QWidget( 1 ) ) ;

transalte declaration is different in Qt 4.6... but maybe it was just

I sent the wrong link,but anyway it states that they too had problems
with memory deallocations and that it is important that each object
has a parent.

The link I wanted to send warned to never allocate a Qt object on the stack...
some thing like
func x()
{
   QPushButton qpb;
}
but allways use new operator....

I'm not saying you are using this, I wanted only to give an info I
found (and you probably already knew)

Yes, but AFAICS this hierarchy is already replicated 
in .prg level wrapper classes, so it's not new information, 
only the storage format would be new. Of course it would 
be nice to store this in an elegant way and without redundancy.

If we have a matching .prg level hierarchy this 
shouldn't be a problem, but I'm letting others to 
contribute, I'm not enough of an OOP/GC expert.

I don't know. Other question: Does QT code use multiple inheritance?

Yes.

That shouldn't be a problem. HBQT doesn't publish 
a C level interface anyway.

We don't allow that in Harbour code, moreover 
it doesn't solve anything compared to current solution, 
it just meshes .c and .prg into physical file.

I meant pure C class declaration / definition.

So it seems current solution is not consistent, or 
there is a rule which controls this. Pritpal could tell it.

Subject: [Harbour] I have a problem with hb_arrayNew ()
Message-ID: <18146083.1271081014907.JavaMail.root@fe-ps02>

Hi all,

I have a doubt with the function hb_arrayNew 
When I create an array in C:

#pragma begindump
#include "hbapi.h"
#include "hbapiitm.h"

HB_FUNC (MyFunc)
{............
.............

pArray = hb_itemNew (NULL);
hb_arrayNew (pArray, size);

..............
...............
}


before the program ends I have necessarily to call:

hb_itemRelease (pArray);

to free the memory allocated? 
or HARBOUR releases automatically?

thanks in advance from Uruguay

This is good for majority of situations but not always.
This all depends on what type of object it is. I mean, if it is 
a pointer to an already-on-the-heap object then we must not 
allocate double resources plus we may not want a copy of the 
original object. For example, 
  oTextBlock := QTextBlock():from( some_other_call_which_return_textblock )
is never supposed to create via new but to work with original one.
Also we must never delete them because they still are valid life-span.

This complexity has led to use only one GC placeholder which 
works in all situations.

Again, I have no issues during the life-time of the object.
The issue arises when parent is destroyed first ( Harbour GC ) 
and child next, which at that point, has already been destroyed.

Yes

> or HARBOUR releases automatically?

No, even MyFunc() needs to return the new array
it needs to be released:

HB_FUNC( MYFUNC )
{
	PHB_ITEM pArray = hb_itemNew( NULL );

	<your operations with pArray here>

	hb_itemReturnRelease( pArray );
}


Please read the following link, even it's based on Clipper 5.2
it perfectly applies to current Harbour too.

Also please note that you need to use uppercase on the
function name ( "MyFunc" is wrong ).


best regards,

Teo

I fully agree with Francesco with:

  - To have the closest replication in Harbour of the
  QT classes hierarchy, object creation and calling methods.
  this basically allows to use the QT documentation in order
  to find what it can does/doesn't in Harbour

To achieve this, is necessary to have a "binding model" that allows:

  - Bind C++ objects with Harbour ones ( of course with class equivalents)
  - Allow to blindly destroy an Harbour object when his C++ counterpart
  is destroyed, and viceversa.
  - Allow to check when a child control depends of some parent and it's
  destroyed automatically when his parent does.

The replica of the hierarchy classes has little to do here as long care is
taken in check the parameters given to the C++ methods which make
the call to the real C++ methods.


Some time ago I did my try with QT, even I could use the same model
that I currently use in wxHarbour to bind C++ objects to Harbour ones.

Unfortunately I'm very busy with current business projects (some of them uses
wxHarbour) to help with the QT develop at this time.

However, I'm interested on improve the model that I use on binding the
C++/Harbour objects. You can check it in the wxHarbour sources and
feel free to ask me questions.

I'm also attaching my simple test that I made for QT/Harbour were I'm
using such model with a sample that runs:



best regards,

Teo

For sure you must have gone through the long thread 

http://n2.nabble.com/HBIDE-Project-build-start-folder-problem-tc4861627.html#a4887410

It describs in detail what you need to do, just follow it.

Half year ago I committed to this list code which realize it:
http://lists.harbour-project.org/pipermail/harbour/2009-October/026490.html

It was example with few typos (see the above thread).
Below is cleaned version which also uses explicit casting.
It fully resolve the problem of casting to ancestors classes
when pointer to QT object is extracted from HVM item with
full validation. Please also note that it does not need any
global replication of QT hierarchy. Just simply each class
can independently decide which casting to ancestor is allowed
by registering itself in the ancestors wrappers using
qt_childregister_<class>() function.
It also does not need metaObject or similar tricks.
All what you need is using such code for all QT classes wrappers.

Przemek

Hi Przemek and All,

Perfect.

Just another idea to put this in practice (and now I'm trying 
to find optimum without thinking about who will or should 
implement this):

Currently we have .qth files as source for the generator.
I'd find it much better to use the QT headers _directly_, 
thus fully automatizing the generator and making it quite 
easy to add/remove classes and update them when newer QT 
versions are released. At the same time making sure that 
we are _really_ covering the actual classes with no room 
for mistakes or differences.

Quick glance to current .qth files shows that it would 
be enough to only cover in local config files the few points 
which need some special handling, the rest could be 
swapped for a more intelligent parser, following #include 
references and parsing QT .cpp headers.

Any opinion on that? (particularly from Pritpal)

[ Anyhow even current .qth files seems enough to implement 
the stuff suggested by Przemek, plus probably the more strict 
parameter type checking, too. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi,

On my ubuntu 10.04 box I compiled and run successfully hbide (from svn of
today).

I have a problem when creating a new project: when clicking on "Save" I get
this error:

Hi all,

I have a doubt with the function hb_arrayNew 
When I create an array in C:

#pragma begindump
#include "hbapi.h"

HB_FUNC (MyFunc)
{............
.............

pArray = hb_itemNew (NULL);
hb_arrayNew (pArray, size);

..............
...............
}


before the program ends I have necessarily to call:


( i guess that you mean "the function" instead of "the program" )



hb_itemRelease (pArray);

to free the memory allocated? 



Yes


or HARBOUR releases automatically?



No, even MyFunc() needs to return the new array
it needs to be released:


HB_FUNC( MYFUNC )
{
PHB_ITEM pArray = hb_itemNew( NULL );


<your operations with pArray here>


hb_itemReturnRelease( pArray );
}



Please read the following link, even it's based on Clipper 5.2
it perfectly applies to current Harbour too.


Also please note that you need to use uppercase on the
function name ( "MyFunc" is wrong ).




best regards,


Teo

I got same errors on Ubuntu 10.04.  I solved it getting zlib from
repository (as well explained on INSTALL doc).  

sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev

True.
But still I need a complete set of .h, .cpp, and .prg for only two 
classes with coubple of functions which compiles to a library.

I had tried it and it was working if I wrote them manually 
to indivisual .cpps.

Let us try this in new folder hbqtex or something.

I think we should go direct from Qt headers but 
I have to investigate it further if all the constructs are present
in those headers or not. Note that documentation of Qt is so 
perfect and everything is available at one place.

Probably, .qth is a more powerful way to go for it.
We can extend its format to cover practically everything.

I hope Przemek can take a look at it.

For me it's difficult to guess the best tweak 
for *nix systems to enable 64-bit file operations.

Pritpal , this thread is not very clear , and I don't found a clear recipe
in howto
configure HBIDE in linux.

I am updating to the last SVN  and tonight i get a new try

by the way , I think that this topic need to be more simple , a new guy
trying harbour
for the first time give up before start.

do not get upset by my words, it is only an opinion

  * harbour/external/zlib/deflate.c
  * harbour/external/zlib/gzread.c
    * pacified warnings
  * harbour/external/zlib/zutil.h
    ! fixed to compile with XCC
  * harbour/external/zlib/zconf.h
    ! removed wrongly added #if 0 / #endif
  * harbour/external/zlib/gzguts.h
    ! added missing header files to fix _ALL_ builds
  * harbour/external/zlib/Makefile
    * reenabled warnings - it's very danger to pacify warnings in such way
      what recent ZLIB update clearly shows - it was seriously broken in all
      builds due to missing header files with valid function declarations
      but the problem was fully hidden because C++ mode and warnings were
      disabled so no problem was reported at compile time.
      Please also remember that many of Windows compilers does not fully
      support pure ANSI C function declaration so this new library may
      not work as expected.

  * harbour/external/libhpdf/hpdfcfg.h
    ! removed setting for all platforms HAVE_UNISTD_H
      this file was generated by autoconf on platform which has <unistd.h>
      but we cannot leave it because it will break all code which uses
      standard autoconf settings like HAVE_UNISTD_H and is compiled
      on platform where <unistd.h> is not available

  * harbour/contrib/hbmzip/ioapi.c
    ! fixed to include ioapi.h before any other header files - it uses
      some feature macros which have to be set before including standard
      C files
  * harbour/contrib/hbmzip/ioapi.h
    ! removed from feature set macros setting of internal __USE_* ones
    ! do not set _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE in DOS and OS2 - macro with the same
      name is used by new ZLIB 1.2.4 for explicit 64 bit gzip API.
  * harbour/contrib/hbmzip/hbmzip.c
    ! fixed old typos in type of return value in hb_zipfileParam() and
      hb_unzipfileParam()

   NOTE: I haven't tested if this new mzip/zlib 64 bit file IO support
         works. It's even possible that previously working code in 64 bit
         platforms (except Win64 on all other 64 bit platforms 'long' is
         64bit integer) stopped to work so please make real tests.

You haven't read Clipper documentation for APPEND FROM ...

VIA <rdd> and SDF are mutual exclusive clauses so such command
does not exists.
   APPEND FROM ... SDF
means append using SDF RDD and
   APPEND FROM ... VIA "DBFCDX"
means append using DBFCDX RDD.

Thank you very much.

Harbour standard warning level was not enabled 
to avoid watching the large amount of warnings 
3rd party sources are usually causing.

I know they can be fixed with local patches, but 
IMO minimizing number of local patches is a higher 
level goal than the current problem when lack of 
strict warning causes problems after an update. 
Updates are seldom, so it's enough to retest them 
once.

Now I'm getting attached warnings with msvc, bcc 
and pocc. (mingw is clean)

Maybe msvc ones can be suppressed with a #pragma?

Brgds,
Viktor

Pritpal,

Ah! - this is related to hbide!
I have just discovered that hbide IS launching ash - but in the 
background and after hbide is closed the process is still running - 
locking the .dbf, which is why I was getting the above error in 
subsequently trying to run my appliaction.
I ran tests on dBlocate() etc and all was fine with current harbour, so 
I re-loaded ash into hbide and tried to launch it.
There is nothing in the log, but /home/baz/hash/ash is running.
These are the open files (after hbide is closed) :-

Not in this case. These warnings were caused by very serious bugs.
If I wouldn't tested it then probably we released wrong binaries.
Working code is much more important then pacifying warnings.
I can leave with warnings but broken binaries are useless
for me.

BCC and POCC does not fully recognize old style function
declarations so in this case they can be generat wrong
code.
Looks that MSVC warnings can be ignored.

> Maybe msvc ones can be suppressed with a #pragma?

and setting _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS.
Seem that all can be done in zutil.h and gzguts.h.

BTW this version does not set -DZLIB_DLL when compiled as
dynamic code.

Can you do it? It's not very good to have 40KB of 
warning in normal builds.

> BTW this version does not set -DZLIB_DLL when compiled as
> dynamic code.

Can you be more specific? I've been looking for ZLIB_DLL 
trick in our own build code, but couldn't find any so to 
me it looks the same as before. Can be I missed something.

zlib has the same code:

...\hb-r200\external\zlib>grep ZLIB_DLL *
zconf.h:213:   /* If building or using zlib as a DLL, define ZLIB_DLL.
zconf.h:216:#  ifdef ZLIB_DLL
zconf.h:224:#  endif  /* ZLIB_DLL */
zconf.h:246:#  ifdef ZLIB_DLL

...\harbour\harbour\external\zlib>grep ZLIB_DLL *
zconf.h:285:   /* If building or using zlib as a DLL, define ZLIB_DLL.
zconf.h:288:#  ifdef ZLIB_DLL
zconf.h:296:#  endif  /* ZLIB_DLL */
zconf.h:318:#  ifdef ZLIB_DLL

Brgds,
Viktor

When a project is launched after build it is done in a detached 
process and it must show up. If what you say is true, then you may 
experiment with 

qProcess:startDetached_2( cTargetFN )

Play with 

METHOD IdeProjManager:launchProject( cProject, cExe )

and let us know what parameters are passed and in what way.
May be we need to initiate a shell command to execute the 
executable.

I am pretty useless with OOP, but digging a little this looks relevant?

 From QT 4.5 QProcess Class Reference
QProcess::startDetached.....

Unix: The started process will run in its own session and act like a daemon.

Windows: The started process will run as a regular standalone process.

I do not know what exactly this means in unix. 
Also I do not know how to cover it. Someone with more nixes knowldge
should tell us.

Hello Przemek,

It runs well with DBFCDX, but you could also work with ADS ?

See this sample:

[CODE]

#include "dbinfo.ch"

function MAIN

request DBFCDX
request  ADS

rddsetdefault( "DBFCDX" )

? hb_rddInfo( RDDI_MEMOEXT, NIL, "DBFCDX" )   && return ".fpt"

? Hb_rddInfo( RDDI_MEMOEXT, ".xxx", "DBFCDX" ) && return: ".fpt"

? hb_rddInfo( RDDI_MEMOEXT, NIL, "DBFCDX" ) && return: ".xxx"

rddsetdefault( "ADS" )

? hb_rddInfo( RDDI_MEMOEXT, NIL, "ADSCDX" )   && return: ".fpt"

? Hb_rddInfo( RDDI_MEMOEXT, ".xxx", "ADSCDX" ) && return: ".fpt"

? hb_rddInfo( RDDI_MEMOEXT, NIL, "ADSCDX" ) && return: ".fpt" <- Here error
? ""

return NIL

[ENDCODE]

Best Regards,

Rossine.

It is similar to running a service in windows. It is not attached to any input 
or output device.

                 The macro is also validated for compilation.
        Set    : current hilighted macro is redefined from values from fields 
                 after duplicate validation. The macro is also validated for compilation.
        Test   : Attempts to compile the macro as a block and reports back if 
                 successful or not. It just compiles but not evaluates.
        delete : deletes the highlighted macro after confirmation.
        Load   : loads macros from a disk-file and merges them with existing ones.
                 In case of duplicacy, last loaded macro is retained.
        Save   : Saves the macros in hbide.scu disk-file in hb_serialize()d form.
        Save As: Saves the macros in a disk-file with any name but with .scu extension.

        Any change is visible instantly,
        Unless <Save> is clicked, current loaded macros are not saved on disk. 
        This allows to use temporary created macros for current session.

Thanks Alex for the info.

So the question is how to invoke it as application but in detached manner.
More investigation is needed from Qt documentation.

Hi Pritpal,

>    ! More fixes to detect the executable from linker output ( still not perfect ).

You explicitly added default empty string as third parameter to STRTRAN(),
but this does nothing, exact same thing is executed.

In another line you remove Chr( 10 ) from a string which should 
never contain this character.

The proper fix here is in your original SUBSTR() which calculates 
the substring length wrongly.

I will commit this fix.

Notice however, that even this won't be enough to properly 
launch the extracted executable name for multiple reasons.

    ! Properly fixed old problem with executable name extraction,
      leaving the ending delimiter in the extracted string.
    ! Added -width= hbmk2 option to cmdline to avoid splitting 
      the output to multiple lines (thus breaking executable name 
      extraction).

  * contrib/hbqt/generator2/hbqtgen2.prg
    + Added more, very rudamentary code to parse QT headers.

   hb_processRun( <cCommand>, [ <cStdIn> ], [ @<cStdOut> ], [ @<cStdErr> ], ;
                  [ <lDetach> ] ) -> <nResult>

<lDetach> must not be .T. if you do not want to execute process in
background (as daemon).
This command is implemented for all platforms.

Well, it was needed before, but not needed now, so it was 
not an old problem. Anyway.

Sorry but I do not have any version of MSVC installed and
it does not work with WINE. I do not even know it's pragma

harbour/external/zlib/ChangeLog:
   2008-08-05 21:39 UTC+0200 Viktor Szakats (harbour.01 syenar.hu)
      * harbour/source/hbzlib/zconf.h
        + Setting ZLIB_DLL if HB_DYNLIB is defined.

Now I can see in harbour/ChangeLog that you removed it:

   2008-08-06 22:56 UTC+0200 Viktor Szakats (harbour.01 syenar.hu)
      * source/hbzlib/zconf.h
        * Undone previous ZLIB_DLL related change, as it causes these
          warnings, when compiled with MSVS:
          hbzlib.obj : warning LNK4217: locally defined symbol _inflateEnd imported in function _hb_zlibUncompressedSize
          hbzlib.obj : warning LNK4217: locally defined symbol _inflate imported in function _hb_zlibUncompressedSize

It was enough to force dllexport instead of dllimport in zconf.h when
HB_DYNLIB argument is set to avoid above warnings.

If <lDetach> == .F. then the process will run under hbIDE's process space,
right?
If yes, then when the control will return to hbIDE ? Immediately after
initiating the process
or after initiated process will terminate?

I'd suggest to check what Przemek suggested, 
plus look at hbmk2, which also has a launch 
feature starting at line 5084 in hbmk2.prg.

Subject: [Harbour] [OT] How to create a win32 service
Message-ID: <002201cadadc$df08b2f0$9d1a18d0$@es>

Hi all,

 

I am in the need of creating a harbour app as a service.  

 

AFIK there are two ways to do that.  One could be using a win32 tool to
convert a console app into a win32 service.  The other is to do it
programmatically.  I prefer second one.

 

Well, I found some code and samples that create and install a service.  

 

Should be compiled 

Hbmk2 ?std ?l{win}xhb test

 

 

The idea is :

 

-          First service should be installed.  This is done by uncommenting
call to ?SvcInstall? function in ?STARTSERVICE?.  This is done by calling
from console  to application.

-          Second is to start service.  This is done by ?Services?.  After
installing service you should find a new entry in services list.  There you
can start/pause/stop this service.

 

Well 
 This code is very bad L.  The idea of a service is to start in a
different entry point than standard main.

 

So
 if someone  can help to get this work I?ll be very happy J

 

Regards,

Jos? Luis Capel

Look at parameters. They give you the answer.
To set <cStdOut>, <cStdErr> and <nResult> is necessary to wait inside
hb_processRun() until executed command terminates.

If you want to still execute your foreground process then use:
   hb_processOpen( <cCommand>, ;
                   [ @<hStdIn> ], [ @<hStdOut> ], [ @<hStdErr> ], ;
                   [ <lDetach> ], [ @<nPID> ] ) -> <hProcess> | F_ERROR
and then:
   hb_processValue( <hProcess> [, <lWait=.T.> ] ) -> <nResult>
or:
   hb_processClose( <hProcess> [, <lGentle=.T.> ] ) -> <lTerminated>

<hStdIn>, <hStdOut> and <hStdErr are file handles from which you can
read and write using FREAD()/FWRITE().
<nResult> is value returned by executed process (errorLevel()),
<lWait> is .T. by default,
<lGentle> is .T. by default, when it's .F. the process is killed
unconditionally.

I tried this:

   hb_processRun( cExecutable, NIL, NIL, NIL, .F. ) 
Executable is invoked but control is returned to the caller after
termination of executable.
   hb_processRun( cExecutable, NIL, NIL, NIL, .T. ) 
Executable is active without showing up interface ( as a daemon ) 
but still control is not returned back to caller, hangs forever and has to
be killed via task manager.

I need a functionality where new process executes normally at its own and 
control is returned back to caller. How this can be achieved with
hb_processRun() ?

I don't understand you. The code is there in 
hbmk2.prg, why don't you take a look at it?

Exactly as I described above.
I know that my English is fatal but"
   "To set <cStdOut>, <cStdErr> and <nResult> is necessary to wait inside
    hb_processRun() until executed command terminates."
seems to be clear.

You have to read my message once again.
I gave you all necessary information.
You have to use hb_processOpen(), i.e.:

   hProccess := hb_processOpen( cExecutable )

   if hProccess != F_ERROR
      while ( nResult := hb_processValue( hProccess, .F. ) ) == -1
         ? "waiting for process..."
         hb_idleSleep( 1 )
      enddo
      ? "process terminated with result:", nResult
   endif

I think I follow what Prital means:-
"...where new process executes normally on its own and control is 
returned back to caller INSTANTLY without waiting for the process to 
complete."

So that the built application will then run totally independently of 
hbide and hbide may be used for other things or closed while the 
application is running.

Barry

Of course nobody has to believe me, but probably 
the most convenient solution is to launch target 
using 'hbmk2 -hbrun my.hbp' (for standalone launch) 
or additional '-run' option (for build and launch operation).

This way there is no need to detect target 
executable name and everything is handled by hbmk2, 
where launching already works (or if there is 
any problem, we can fix it at one place).

Brgds,
Viktor

Subject: [Harbour] Anyone interested to join an ERP project based on
	Harbour+Web+SQL?
Message-ID: <z2n9257026e1004130351o657f3f3z2454b1807ff66734@mail.gmail.com>

I'm extending my ERP to support multiple languages and multiple fiscal
laws but I can't easily find developers that are skilled in Harbour,
Web techs, SQL and that can work on localizations.

I'm wondering if instead of doing everything internally, it wouldn't
be better to share the project with a small group of colleagues based
in different countries.

I don't know exactly how this could be done but I'm finding that the
move from dbfs to SQL and from GT to Web already require major changes
of the code so it could be the right moment to redesign the apps.
Clearly I cannot start from scratch since today the ERP is used by
many customers and I have to provide a smooth migration path but there
could be room to make it highly configurable.

Any comments?

best regards,
Lorenzo

It may be an intresting harbour experience

How you made DBF2SQL
mediator,sql lib offer a easy way commercial
sqllib a open source way

Regarding GT to Web hi hope that harbour write a limited gt for each browser
As intresting experiment in web area for harbour
Minigui script have  made an intresting experiment
Fivewin have a GTAPI
i remember also a Vailton open source Project

If I run from command line :-

[baz@jackodesktop hash]$ hbmk2 ash.hbp -run

then ash is built and runs, but it is in a terminal window labelled 
"hash:hbmk2"

If I kill the hbmk2 process then the running ash process drops to a 
prompt, with ./ash still taking 25% cpu and showtime() still running, 
displaying the time (as it does in ash).

It's the same with:
[baz@jackodesktop hash]$ hbmk2 ash.hbp -hbrun

The launched process still depends on hbmk2.
Is there a way to launch a new terminal window and run the process in 
that, so the launched app is truly independant ?

Rgds,
Barry

Massimo, solution to my "other problem" will be a side-effect of what
is being worked on now.

Francesco

Massimo, il lavoro che si sta facendo ora, di inserire una migliore
gestione degli oggetti in hbqt, permetter? di adattare il codice dei
costruttori per avere funzioni di overloading... esempio al volo, in
c++ puoi avere due funzioni con lo stesso nome ma TIPI dei parametri
diversi:
funzione( int )
funzione( string, int)
in harbour non puoi, quindi dentro funzione devi controllarti il
numero dei parametri E IL TIPO, cose che fin'ora (o meglio, fino a che
non verr? a breve implementato) non ? possibile per gli oggetti di
hbqt....

I don't know, but if someone gives me some hints, 
it's very easy to implement in hbmk2. It already 
works for win, darwin and os2.

For *nix it's AFAIK desktop dependent, and we should 
also have a default version which is plain terminal 
based.

Here is my code to do that, but I'd highly appreciate 
if *nix experts would comment on it, before I add it 
to Harbour:
---
   IF     ! Empty( GetEnv( "GNOME_DESKTOP_SESSION_ID" ) )
      nResult := hb_run( "gnome-open " + cFileName )
   ELSEIF ! Empty( GetEnv( "KDEDIR" ) )
      nResult := hb_run( "kfmclient exec " + cFileName )
   ELSE
      nResult := hb_run( cFileName )
   ENDIF
---

Brgds,
Viktor

It may be an intresting harbour experience

How you made DBF2SQL
mediator,sql lib offer a easy way commercial
sqllib a open source way

Regarding GT to Web hi hope that harbour write a limited gt for each
browser
As intresting experiment in web area for harbour
Minigui script have  made an intresting experiment
Fivewin have a GTAPI
i remember also a Vailton open source Project

*-------------------------

Work with various SQL databases have mastered a variety of ways (I'm
getting ready to use OCI.LIB).
It works great!

In Harbour are examples of codes 2 web servers, and this, unfortunately,
still not started to "tame":(
I still think that GTNET may be a better solution (for applications
[worked] on the server side).

More detailed error... seems there is something wrong in sent header:

I can run KDE, Gnome, LXDE or ICEWM here - so am happy to do some testing.

In KDE I have no KDEDIR envar by default, so it may be distro specific. 
( I run Mandriva 2010.0 )

This will launch a new konsole (in KDE) and run my ash application :-

proc main
hb_run( "konsole --workdir /home/baz/hash -e /home/baz/hash/ash" )
return

I can close the calling konsole without affecting it and the new konsole 
closes when the (non-GUI) application closes.

I will look at Gnome later.
Rgds,
Barry

Thank you very much for your work because I think it can go in the
right direction. I didn't study your code yet but I want to ask you
one thing anyway... can may the code be written to be modular and
easily adaptable to various sources ? It may be nice tobe able to
harbour-ize any external library using a generator to create the
interface...  Probably this generator already exists for Harbour but I
never heard of it.... for example how were created the bindings to
harupdf ?

They seem to be console codes... like if not the correct GT is being used...

You can use wget to get the page and store in a file:
wget -O outputfile http://sitename/url.cgi

in outputfile you have the returned text from the server..... Other
than that messy stuff, is there the expected text ?

Marco, we do not know why these errors appear in Ubuntu.
The one solution could be, upgrade your Qt version to higher release.
It may facilitate us to understand the correct behavior.

Hi Francesco,

(pls don't cut the whole context, it's difficult to know 
by SVN revision number, what was the original msg)

Maybe can be done to some extent, but I'm nearly sure 
this can never be a fully generic process. With most libs 
you need to understand the background logic which you can 
rarely deduct from plain headers. If you're through that, 
you need to map types, which even for the simpler cases 
would require a complete C preprocessor and language 
parser to work with all projects. You also need to know 
what to parse and what to ignore, otherwise you will end 
up struggling with rare exceptions, no one would ever 
need anyway.

This horizon is so wide that I prefer to keep it 
QT specific. I even hope someone can take it from this 
stage (Pritpal I hope).

Brgds,
Viktor

I use Apache, Harbour and CGI every day and I can assure it works even
better than other web solutions.

outstd() and -gtcgi flag are all you need to start.

I can't say anything about THTML.

Well described.
No parser can cater to all libraries.

I am looking at it, but right now casually, devided in hbIDE and hbQT.
Sure I will take over. Please keep up.

Yesterday I started generator3 to base Przemek code through 
.qth concept, but then immediately dropped because of time constraints.
Right now, probably, it is better for the project is to raise hbIDE to 
some level, keeping in view the immense user interest.

But surely I will take over.

Okay, so please keep up with gen3, and I'll finish 
off my part with an interface which is able to feed 
.qth format files, but internally (except the CODE section).
It won't be most efficient, but it's the generator only 
and it can later be streamlined.

BTW IMO getting this right is more important than any 
HBIDE work. HBIDE works enough that everyone can play 
with it, but it conveys very bad image that there are 
everyday problems in Linux f.e.

Anyhow it is your time, and this is my 2 cents.

Brgds,
Viktor

Yes, for sure, but still I am handicapped on account of 
Linux behavior. Many are resolved and rest will be resolved.
As far as destructors behavior, I am really at a loss why 
on one OS Qt behaves properly and on another does not.
If the behavior is consistent, we can fix easily, but 
under current scenario it is indifferent and here lies 
the crux of delay.

No Linux user has come forward to play with hbQT through hbIDE 
to forward any solution, so I am just stumbling upon the 
ideas which I forward and someone has to test.

May be situation improves the next days.

It doesn't work right on any of the platforms, but 
apparently on Windows the problems are less 
visible. GPF's are still normal on Windows HBIDE, too, 
even after many of the problems were masked.

We've been discussing the problems even yesterday 
in great detail. Currently we're counting on luck (or 
manual hacks) to not have GPFs in HBQT. Until all 
places where there is any theoretical/potential 
GPF get fixed, we can never be sure of anything. 
That's the basic problem with HBQT.

It's not a Linux problem. So no Linux user can give 
you any Linux specific fix for these problems.

At least we have some GPFs to test the issues with.

Brgds,
Viktor

testcgi.prg doesn't work.

Try to compile the code below and put it in your cgi-bir dir.

procedure main(...)

  local s_cNewLine := HB_OSNewLine()

  outstd( "CONTENT-TYPE: TEXT/HTML" + s_cNewLine + s_cNewLine )
  outstd( "<HTML><HEAD>" + s_cNewLine + ;
      "<TITLE>" + hb_pValue(1) + "</TITLE>" + s_cNewLine + ;
      "<BODY>" + "Hello World!" + s_cNewLine + ;
      "</BODY></HTML>" )

return

best regards,
Lorenzo

i test with this t1.prg


FUNCTION Main()
   s_cNewLine := HB_OSNewLine()
//   s_cNewLine := chr(10)
      cContent :=
               ;

      "I am <b>Harbour</b>"
      outstd(cContent)
return

# compile hbmk2 t1.prg -lgtcgi -rebuild

then mv the compiled file to my /home/ubuntu/sit/cgi-bin/ dir
dressing owner and permissions

the output from apache cgi is;

my conf of apache is:

If you look at the cgi script it requires a parameter, so you should
call it with a testcgi?Name

Please look at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3875.txt

OK I have been playing and I now have hbide launching my non-GUI 
application in konsole in KDE using :-

       ELSE
*     qProcess:startDetached_2( cTargetFN )
       cRunStr := "konsole --workdir " + oProject:wrkDirectory + " -e " 
+ cTargetFN
       hb_run( cRunStr )
       ENDIF

I can close hbide or continue with it while the application runs.

This is different thing.
When you are working with XWindow then you can execute new
programs in separated terminal windows. Such functionality
should be optional, i.e. hbide can have an option:
   [x] execute in new terminal
so user can set it when he thinks it's necessary for his
program. In such case the application should be executed
using some terminal emulator, i.e. xterm, pterm, rxvt,
konsole, gnome-terminal, ...
It would be niece if user can choose preferred terminal.
As default hbide can use: "xterm -e " as most portable
setting and user can change it i.e. to: "konsole -e" or
"pterm -e" ...
-e <cmd> <args,...> is the standard option in most of
terminal emulators.

Warning some gnome-terminal versions have problems with
this functionality.

Now it remains to be seen how to detect that 'konsole' 
needs to be used.

Is there any universal solution in the Linux world 
for that whole isse? F.e. on OS X it's called 'open <f>'.

Speaking of hbmk2, which has a -run/-hbrun functionality, 
above configurable method seems to defeat the whole 
purpose of these option (namely to launch target executable 
in a _simple_ way).

What do you recommend as a simple, default, commonly working 
launch method for hbmk2, which sort of works like 'start' and 
'open' in other operating system? (keeping in mind, that 
an app can be GUI, CUI and cmdline)

Brgds,
Viktor

Yes I agree - I was already thinking along those lines, as the visual 
effect in different terminal emulators varies dramatically.
I have hacked hbide to test and this is working with and without 
parameter passed to application :-

*   LOCAL cTargetFN, cTmp, oProject, qProcess, qStr, cExt, cRunStr
     LOCAL cTargetFN, cTmp, oProject, cExt, cRunStr
-------snip-------
       #if 1
*      qProcess := QProcess():new()
*      qProcess:setWorkingDirectory( hbide_pathToOSPath( 
oProject:wrkDirectory ) )
       IF !empty( oProject:launchParams )
*         qStr := QStringList():new()
*         qStr:append( oProject:launchParams )
*        qProcess:startDetached_1( cTargetFN, qStr )
	cRunStr := "konsole --workdir " + hbide_pathToOSPath( 
oProject:wrkDirectory ) + " -e " + cTargetFN +" "+oProject:launchParams
       ELSE
*     	qProcess:startDetached_2( cTargetFN )
	cRunStr := "konsole --workdir " + hbide_pathToOSPath(

       ENDIF
       hb_run( cRunStr )
*      qProcess:waitForStarted()
*      qProcess := NIL

       #else
        .......

For me current hbmk2 behavior is perfect. Nothing to change.
hbmk2 is command line tools so it already has terminal device
where is executed and if I sue -run option then it means that
I want to use this TTY device. If I want to demonize some
programs then I usually have my own code inside the application
which will detach the process from current process group so
I do not need any special switches or if I want to execute
as daemon application which was not designed for such usage
then I use nohup or similar tools redirecting IO and using &
shell operator. I can also use shell commands like fg, bg, kill,
wait, jobs to control such application. We can extend hbmk2
but in fact it will still support only small subset of existing
shell functionality so I do not think it's necessary to make
anything with it.
With HBIDE the problem is a little bit different.
This is GUI application so to execute console programs it should
create terminal window in which they will be executed.

BTW probably most of people do not know about it but first GT
driver which was able to create many console windows in single
application and switch between them in [x]Harbour world was GTCRS
I created long time ago for xHarbour. This code is still present
in our GTCRS though disabled by #if 0 (see create_newXterm()).
It uses xterm to create new terminal windows. This code may help
to understand how they work on lower level. Maybe in some spare
time I'll reenable it using current Harbour multiwindow API.

On Ubuntu 10.04 32 bits Harbour Rev. 14331 test:

a) - Launching Hbide from the source contrib dir path
b) - Creating a test1 project ( with only one source, simply a qout("hello

c) - Compiling the project: "hello" is created in
./contrib/hbide/projects/hello but hbide auto create and run don't find the
file
so the autometed run can be done.

More test in my spare time...

In Ubuntu 10.04 Hbide don't get any GPF error ( tomorrow i will test on
Ubuntu 9.10 and i will report here )

Hope this helps, best regards,

Thank you.
You know we are struggling how to get it working on Linux.
If you could post the log, all the better.

Yes, and quiet a lot.

This suggests that Qt and/or some versions of Linux are not aligned
together.

Pritpal , why not do the same that sources , and use a dialog to add
libraries and includes to the project ?

Why we need to think in such syntax when HBIDE could make it in an automatic
way ?

Subject: [Harbour] some more changes to generator
Message-ID: <s2x6943770e1004131756hf4bdd04i69f16c7d182f3f45@mail.gmail.com>

i attach a generator I modified with these goals:
1 - Trying to avoid some casting in c++ code
2 - Using QPointer instead of pointers for ph when possible (pq member
was removed)
3 - Explicitely deleting QPointer



This is the last version and seems to be ok for a small, QpushButton
only program. I'd recompile the whole library but it's 3 am.... Let me
know what you think

Francesco

PS: since I didn't try the generator after the last changes I tried
directly on QPushButton, I attach the working copy....

Pritpal, surely i will test on Ubuntu but i want to suggest you to have a
self Linux environment:
it  require very simple steps:
a) install Virtulbox on Win www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
<http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>b) download the ubuntu 10.04 iso
from ubuntu-10.04-beta2-desktop-i386.iso from
 releases.ubuntu.com/lucid/ ubuntu 10.04 will be released stable at the end
of this month but it is already pretty usable
c) start Virtualbox on Win put  create a virtual pc with 20 giga of dynamic
disk,
 on property of the just created virtual pc set the downloaded  Ubuntu iso
file as cd starting medium
d) install Ubuntu
e) follow this note www.elart.it/links/harbourhowto_deb_en.php

<http://www.elart.it/links/harbourhowto_deb_en.php>In this way you will have
win and Ubuntu running at the same time on a single pc and this might help
you to autotest Hbide.

best regards,
Marco

Marco,
can't you prepare a virtual installation for Pritpal ?

Virtualbox or Vmware client or whatever Pritpal agrees on....

I just received a phone call from an experienced windows user that
tried to install ubuntu on one pc and got confused...


I can prepare a vmware virtual machine by the end of next week and put
it on a web server for download...

Or anyone can take one from here:
   http://virtualboxes.org/images/ubuntu/

BTW, Ubuntu installation is pretty dead simple, 
it's nothing compared to Red Hat and some old 
distros some may remember.

@Francesco Perillo

Installing Ubuntu in a virtual pc ( i suggest Virtualbox ) inside Windows or
in a real pc with Windows in dual boot mode is very very very easy...

@Viktor i suggest to Pritbal to install VirtualBox and Ubuntu 10.04 because
it have the latest qt into repositories and it get less GPF than Ubuntu 9.10
and it will became into a stable state in the next days so install the
Ubuntu 10.04 32bit beta2 and then simply upgrading using the
System?Administration?Update manager?Verify?Install

BTW i use always Ubuntu installed onto real pc as unique sysop, i have only
one installed  Win on a Virtualbox created virtual-pc on an Ubuntu pc (Rel.
10.04)

Hth, best regards
Marco

Marco, I know this (I use linux from the gone "floppy" days), and for
me and you installing and configuring linux is really easy...
nonetheless this my friend, really really expert on windows side,
installed ubuntu but was not able to get an ip from the dhcp server...
and gave up...

More, in order to have replicable error situations, perhaps it is
better we all settle to use one specific VM (no updates enabled)....

I'd however strongly suggest to not try to fix problems 
blindly by installing newer versions of complete OS. This 
is the most silly thing we can do, unless our goal is to 
drop any notion to follow quality and to control our own 
codebase. I hope it isn't.

Pls remember we're supposed to support QT 4.5.x as well, and 
latest stable release of Ubuntu (9.10) contains just that 
version.

Brgds,
Viktor

To get or force renew of an ip from dhcpserver

Open a terminal from Application?Accessories?Terminal and type:

sudo dhclient

give the user login password when requested it will not replyed to the
screen when you write it, then press enter

to see the network conf type:

ifconfig

Usually the system must get it automatically it must be some issue with
network-manager configuration i suggest you to install and use wicd

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wicd

Then use this network manager if it solve your issue.

Hth, best regards

Hi All,

Above version got out on Monday, Express version as well.

[ Microsoft is hopeless: you're forced to upgrade 
system components and even restart is required (in the 
middle of the process) just to install this development 
environment (I didn't select MSSQL). Awaiting SDK 7.1. ]

Brgds,

I continued to do some work on the generator and implemented the check
on ->calls

From:
HB_FUNC( QT_QAPPLICATION_CURSORFLASHTIME )
{
   hb_retni( hbqt_par_QApplication( 1 )->cursorFlashTime() );
}

To:
HB_FUNC( QT_QAPPLICATION_CURSORFLASHTIME )
{
   QApplication * p ;
   p = hbqt_par_QApplication( 1 ) ;
   if( p )
      hb_retni( ( p )->cursorFlashTime() );
   else
      HB_TRACE.....
}


My goal was to check if during the delete of an object  would sometime
 call-back trick, or internal destroy procedures would ignite the
GPF... it does not at the moment... but since I think it is a good
thing to have this check  I propose this change...

During my short test I run hbide and it opened ok, with just these lines:

QApplication and QPixmap)

I agree but i think might be a better starting point to have a working hbide
enviroment.
Hbide have some kind of issue with selecting path dialog on create new
project

BTW we can have multiple Ubuntu and sysop installed on the same pc using
VirtualBox

In my ubuntu 9.10 i have this release of qt installed i also use qt for
compiling qgis www.qgis.org/  from svn, so might be there is some different
in my packages :

libqt4-dev                                     4:4.6.2

Pacchetto: libqt4-dev
Versione: 4:4.6.2-0ubuntu3~karmic1~ppa1
Responsabile: Kubuntu Developers <kubuntu-devel@lists.ubuntu.com>

So i have in the single Ubuntu 9.10 tha i use a not standard release of
qt... and i report GPF of hbide from this release of QT, might be not a good
choice.
BTW i use to compile almost every day and i use  qgis for my work without
any issue and hbide compile fine.

Do you think this env might generate confusion testing hbide ?
if yes i will stop to report testing from this pc.

Best regards,
Marco

IMO it would be better to have a working HBQT library. 

HBIDE is based on it, so until HBQT doesn't work properly, 
HBIDE never will.

Our major goal is to have a working GUI library in the 
first place, then we can start to care about stuff built 
upon it, like an IDE or whatever else. HBIDE is currently 
useful though for testing HBQT problems.

> BTW we can have multiple Ubuntu and sysop installed on the same pc using VirtualBox

Of course.

Yes it could, but I don't know enough details to 
tell for sure. At least now we see you have a special 
environment, which is important information to put 
your GPF reports in context.

To tell further, you can check on QT/Ubuntu forums, 
what they say about such configuration.

I'd personally recommend to use default configuration 
for a start though, especially since we don't even 
support QT 4.6.x in Harbour officially yet.

Brgds,
Viktor

It is not very important what I think, but what the group thinks. I'm
not in front of the Harbour project and do not think I should opine on
this. But as you asked my opinion I can tell you that I see no problem
in removing my name from these pages of the project. I left because I
just entered my email as a contact, in case anyone finds any problem
in the page  can contact me asking for the fix. I do not think the
Harbour Project pages should be used for personal promotion and as an
example, I'll be removing my name from all the pages if the group
wishes.

>> What think About it?

IMO you don't have to be the messenger here.

I personally haven't seen any project where logo creator's 
name (or any other contributor's name, besides webdesigner 
name in a few cases) is put on every page of the project. 
It's now shown on the logo/art page where it's unmistakably 
and perfectly visible (if not, it can be tweaked I'm sure) 
and appropriate.

FWIW I would recommend Mandriva Linux 2010.0

1. It is stable.
2. It ships with qt 4.5.x as standard.
3. I have not seen a single gpf while testing hbide in it.
4. It ships with both KDE4 and Gnome D.E.s on one installation DVD.iso
5. Installation is straightforward and the system management control 
centre is very user friendly.
6. It does not use grub2 or re-format your swap partition and change 
it's UUID on installation. (unlike Ubuntu)
7. Iso is available via .torrent here:
http://distrib-coffee.ipsl.jussieu.fr/pub/linux/MandrivaLinux/official/iso/2010.0/mandriva-linux-free-2010.0-i586.iso
8. ...or all mirrors with ftp etc. :-
http://api.mandriva.com/mirrors/list.php

My 2 cents :-)

Hi Shum

Let me notice you this is a DEVELOPPERS list. Not a user's request one. 
Neither a users support one.
This is an Open Source projects and it's merely is a buch of individual 
and voluntary contributions.
If you have a clue why it is GPF-ing or a test bed wheter to help find 
the problem, then it is appropiate to post here.
But you can't ask anything from anyone here.
A lot of good people are giving their spare time to this project move 
forward.

Regards
Angel

I don't know. I didn't write it and I don't find it useful.
IMHO HTML is so well documented and supported that hiding it behind a
class is a waste of resources.

Francesco, carry on.
I am onto it and have spent few hours on your previous upload.
I have noticed some points. Now I will include this patch also and will 
continue to experiment. I will forward detailed analysis later.

I am not replying you because I do not want to influence your line of
thoughts.

BTW you are heading towards right direction.

Try to implement concept like this ( Przemek's code ):

  pObj = ( QPointer< QPageSetupDialog > * ) 
            memset( hb_gcAllocate( sizeof( QPointer< QPageSetupDialog > ), 
                                   &s_gcQPageSetupDialog ), 
                    0, sizeof( QPointer< QPageSetupDialog > ) ); 
   * pObj = obj;

It is already "included".... it is visually different as we use object
and not *object and we gcAllocate QGC_OBJECT and not directly the
object... but the result is the same (should be :-) )

What really surprised me is the not getting a GPF when
( p) ->funz()
and p is NULL.....

I will resume the work later this evening...

I miss one point: hbqt_garbage include
extern ... ( void *, iParam)
I already changed void * to the correct class but then I should
include all the headers...

I'm in a hurry I will explain better later..

Sounds correct.


What really surprised me is the not getting a GPF when
( p) ->funz()
and p is NULL.....


Yep, and I am surprised too.

BTW this patch has provided more insight in how some objects
must behave with singal/slots and events.

Check for _new_QTableWidgetItem and then ProcessEvnts() firing.
This is something I have to fix.


I will resume the work later this evening...

I miss one point: hbqt_garbage include
extern ... ( void *, iParam)
I already changed void * to the correct class but then I should
include all the headers...

Keep on, hopefully we will be on target soon.

As I replied before, I have no clue how Harbour Dll's interact on class
objects
and instance variables, so cannot forward you a solution.

In the meantime, try to build stand-alone exe to proceed further.

This is not a show-stopper or something to wait for.

Hi All,

I hope someone can fix these. These were so far 
hidden because of turned off warnings for exotic 
compilers like bcc/pocc/xcc when building 
external libs. Now they are visible.

If the problems won't be resolved, I will simply 
disable failing libs for these targets.

Brgds,
Viktor

i found this
MySQL 5.1 also supports the execution of a string containing multiple statements separated by semicolon (?;?) 
characters. This capability is enabled by special options that are specified either when you connect to the server with mysql_real_connect() or after connecting by calling` mysql_set_server_option(). 

and i saw in hbmysql\mysql.c, there isn?t CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS
can someone implements this in hbmysql?

/* connect to server with the CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS option */
if (mysql_real_connect (mysql, host_name, user_name, password,
    db_name, port_num, socket_name, CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS) == NULL)
{
  printf("mysql_real_connect() failed\n");
  mysql_close(mysql);
  exit(1);
}

/* execute multiple statements */
status = mysql_query(mysql,
                     "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table;\
                      CREATE TABLE test_table(id INT);\
                      INSERT INTO test_table VALUES(10);\
                      UPDATE test_table SET id=20 WHERE id=10;\
                      SELECT * FROM test_table;\
                      DROP TABLE test_table");
if (status)
{
  printf("Could not execute statement(s)");
  mysql_close(mysql);
  exit(0);
}

/* process each statement result */
do {
  /* did current statement return data? */
  result = mysql_store_result(mysql);
  if (result)
  {
    /* yes; process rows and free the result set */
    process_result_set(mysql, result);
    mysql_free_result(result);
  }
  else          /* no result set or error */
  {
    if (mysql_field_count(mysql) == 0)
    {
      printf("%lld rows affected\n",
            mysql_affected_rows(mysql));
    }
    else  /* some error occurred */
    {
      printf("Could not retrieve result set\n");
      break;
    }
  }
  /* more results? -1 = no, >0 = error, 0 = yes (keep looping) */

Hi,

MYSQL_REAL_CONNECT() .prg function does support fifth 'flags' parameter in Harbour.

Hi Pritpal,

I'd say just make your VM boot from the installation .iso.
It's as easy as installing Ubuntu from that point.

If everything fails I'm sure some easy googling will 
help you out here.

I use suse enterprise server 10 at the office and I STRONGLY suggest
to NOT use it for developing. Infact it misses several libraries,
includes etc

Please use OpenSuse, Ubuntu, Mandriva  whatever you like but DO NOT
use SLES or RedHat advanced server...

It's not correct solution.
It only breaks few things instead of fixing real problem.

All are false alarms.
I can pacify the warnings adding redundant initialization in
hbzlib.c and hbbz2.c but it will be hard to make something with
harboury. and macroy.c because it's code generated by bison.
I already use a little bit patched bison to generate our grammar
files so I can add some farther modification to pacify also above
MSVC warnings.

but mysql_query in hbmysql.c don?t loop for statements
If you enable CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS or CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS, you should 
process the result for every call to mysql_query() or mysql_real_query() by using a loop that calls mysql_next_result() to determine whether there are more results. For an example, see Section 21.9.12, ?C API Support for Multiple Statement Execution?. 

there isn?t mysql_next_result in harbour

guys this is only a suggestion, don?t kill me lol

Hi,

MYSQL_REAL_CONNECT() .prg function does support fifth 'flags' parameter in Harbour.

I'm about to implement a -massivedebug switch to the generator....
sample:
HB_FUNC( QT_QPUSHBUTTON_ISFLAT )
{
   QPushButton * p;
   HB_TRACE( HB____, ( "Entering function QT_QPUSHBUTTON_ISFLAT" ) );


and with a bit more knowledge on parameters/object (also thanks to
Viktor generator2) we may also print the parameter passed and the
return value/pointer...


I also created my cppstub with some debug info inside... I need to
print more infos and then match one new with one delete....

Ciao

This post is through FireFox from within Virtual-box and Ubuntu 9.10.
My first entry familiarity with Linux. I am happy I could do it out of the
box.
I tried also SuSE10 but failed miserably on installation. 

So for hbQT debugging I am ready for the next step.
Please let me step-through how I can setup Harbour ?

Hi

I want discuss some things with who uses FoxPro. I have some code which
barely translates some FoxPro syntax, but was not my intent reproduce Foxpro
behavior. I will need adapt to be used as a FoxPro compatibility layer.

It's very good to see all that progress about HBQt. I think the HBQt is
going to right way. I hope can help in a near future.

Hi Viktor

Are you talking about Harbour GC or ref count in general? Ref count is
enough for this task? Is not possible have circular references?

Can you talk about Harbour GC? I want know about Harbour internals.

fill that subjective criteria.

*For me* Harbour is very well, getting points mostly on building/bundling. I

Might be useful to set some default, please type this command:
sudo update-alternatives --set moc /usr/bin/moc-qt4


Harbour how to get source and compile them from SVN trunk
1) - Open a terminal window from menu Applications: Accessories: Terminal;
2) - Check the requested packages as specified on top of this page;
3) - Type or copy and paste (a row a time then press enter) into the
terminal window:
mkdir $HOME/src
cd $HOME/src
svn co https://harbour-project.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/harbour-project/trunk/harbour
harbour
cd $HOME/src/harbour
export HB_BIN_INSTALL=/usr/bin
export HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/bin
export HB_LIB_INSTALL=/usr/lib/harbour
export HB_INC_INSTALL=/usr/include/harbour
export HB_DOC_INSTALL=/usr/share/doc/harbour
export HB_ETC_INSTALL=/etc/harbour
export HB_CONTRIBLIBS="hbqt hbct hbhpdf hblog hbxml hbmzip hbtip
hbvpdf hbxbp hbgd hbpgsql hbcurl hbmysql hbsqlit3 hbssl hbodbc rddsql
gtqtc hbmisc"
export HB_BUILD_SHARED=no
make clean
make
sudo -E make install
harbour -build


How to update and compile Harbour from svn sources
To update and compile Harbour from latest svn revision please download
this shell script: using terminal type o better copy and paste the
rows below, please copy and paste one row a time, then press enter:

mkdir $HOME/src
cd $HOME/src
wget http://www.elart.it/harbour/MBaggharbour2_svn
chmod 700 MBaggharbour2_svn
./MBaggharbour2_svn

The above instructions are to be done only one time, then, to update
and compile Harbour from SVN sources, you simply need to run the
script by opening a terminal and typing:

cd $HOME/src; ./MBaggharbour2_svn

To compile the sources in the contrib directories for example hbide, type :

cd $HOME/src/harbour/contrib/hbide
hbmk2 hbide.hbp -rebuild

To run the just compiled hbide type:
./hbide

This bug exists with _ALL_ C compilers we are using.
Just simply your recent modifications enabled warnings only
for few compilers but many others like all GCC based ones
still does not report any warnings so such bugs are invisible.

Missing prototypes means that C compiler may incorrectly create
function call frame so final code will GPF or fail in other way
depending on used ABI and type of parameters.

To fix such problems it's necessary to know about them
and this library is yet another example that disabled
warnings may cause that we are creating wrong binaries
without any knowledge about it.
The problem is that nearly all of these libraries uses
autoconf to generate configuration header files but we
not and we are using in all builds only some statically
defined for chosen platform files without real system
dependent configuration so such definition can be wrong
and broken code is generated. With fully disabled warnings
we do not know about it.
In this particular case (JPEG library) HAVE_PROTOTYPES
definition is missing and it's the reason of above errors
in _all_ builds (we do not support any old C compiler which
does not support prototypes).

best regards,
Przemek

I think in our case hbmk2 is more like -100 points.

I reached the point where I can't do more with the 
issue. If a warning is not reported in default warning 
mode I have to assume it's not grave, or the compiler 
is just plain careless, but anyhow it's not something 
I'm willing to tweak forever.

There is no _disabled_ warnings in Harbour now. There 
are two modes: 1) default warning level 2) Harbour high 
level warnings.

If someone wishes to deal with the issue, one can up 
the default warning level explicitly to some higher one, 
but in this case we can easily come back to the initial 
issue with lots of required local patches to external code, 
which in turn nobody likes to create in the first place 
(besides you), nobody manages throughout updates (besides 
you and me), nobody submits upstream (besides me), and 
which I need maintain .dif files for (BTW I'm stopping 
doing that from today).

Harbour doesn't explicitly select "fully disabled 
warnings". (if it still does because I missed some, 
pls report it)

To repeat, if someone would like to deal with it, 
it's enough to start upping the "default" level 
explicitly to have a good balance between catching 
real problems and leaving uninteresting warnings 
turned off. It's not solution however to use our 
highest level, because it generates so much warnings, 
that we won't readily notice the important ones 
among them, and it would be just unmaintainable to 
have huge local patches to reach our own level of 
code quality.

Pritpal, I now think that in prg classes we should add destructor and
destroy all the children at harbour level from there, so doing that
ourself  and not leaving the job to Qt....

The other test I want to do is to use object.deleteLater() but it is
not a "solution", is an hack....

More short and easy from www.elart.it/links/harbourhowto_deb_en.php (i wrote
that page):

Ubuntu 9.10 install harbour and other stuffs

First be sure is enabled the Universe repository from menu:
System:Administration:Software Sources: Ubuntu software [tab]

Then open terminal from Applications: Accessories: Terminal and type or
better copy the red rows below and paste them into the terminal window:
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install subversion wget rcs
build-essential ncurses-dev libslang2-dev tk8.3-dev unixodbc-dev
libncurses-dev libx11-dev libgpm-dev firebird2.1-dev libfreeimage-dev
libmysqlclient15-dev libpq-dev libqt3-mt-dev liballegro4.2-dev wine

libx11-dev libgpmg1-dev unixodbc-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev firebird2.1-dev
libgd2-xpm-dev libsqlite3-dev libqt4-dev

Might be useful to set some default, please type this command:
sudo update-alternatives --set moc /usr/bin/moc-qt4

Then to download and to compile Harbour please simply try this:

mkdir $HOME/src
cd $HOME/src
wget http://www.elart.it/harbour/MBaggharbour2_svn
chmod 700 MBaggharbour2_svn
./MBaggharbour2_svn

And your system will  be ready to compile hbide

cd $HOME/src/harbour/contrib/hbide
hbmk2 hbide -rebuild

to run hbide type:

./hbide


Hope this helps

Marco

It doesn't matter how you call it.
Important is only real results.
Default settings means disabled warnings in many C compilers.

You may need explicit destructors in .prg code only if you plan to
keep some structures which are not released automatically in harbour
object. If you correctly implement releasing all QT objects by automatic
GC pointer item destructors then you will not need any PRG level
destructors to replicate the same job.
BTW the only one thing which should be introduced yet is an option to
mark GC pointer items as attached to other QT structures so they should
not be released automatically with the HVM item because they will be
released with parent object.

Yes, indeed, this is the solution for the so hunted GPF-s in HBQT.

In the attachment is the hbqt patch for the hbide crashes in different circumstances.

The problem is generated by the following sequences in searchreplace.uic:

        horizontalSpacer = new QSpacerItem(40, 20, QSizePolicy::Expanding, QSizePolicy::Minimum);
        horizontalLayout->addItem(horizontalSpacer);
and

        horizontalSpacer_2 = new QSpacerItem(40, 20, QSizePolicy::Expanding, QSizePolicy::Minimum);
        horizontalLayout_2->addItem(horizontalSpacer_2);

The QSpacerItem is not in inherited from QObject and in this way Qt has no information about the deletion of the object executed by hbqt. After deletion of the QSpacerItem by hbqt the subsequent delete of the horizontalLayout or horizontalLayout_2 generates in Qt engine the deletion of the child object, in our case the already deleted QSpacerItem...crash.

The attachment contains:
a. QLayout.cpp the generated cpp file.
b. QLayout.qth with the modified QT_QLAYOUT_ADDITEM:

<CODE>
...
 
HB_FUNC( QT_QLAYOUT_ADDITEM )
{
   QGC_POINTER * p;
   QGC_POINTER * q;

   HB_TRACE( HB_TR_DEBUG, ( "Entering function QT_QLAYOUT_ADDITEM()" ) );

   q = ( QGC_POINTER * ) hb_parptrGC( hbqt_gcFuncs(), 1 );
   p = ( QGC_POINTER * ) hb_parptrGC( hbqt_gcFuncs(), 2 );

   if( p && p->ph && q && q->ph )
   {
      HB_TRACE( HB_TR_DEBUG, ( "QT_QLAYOUT_ADDITEM() Qt oject: %p is attached to: %p", p->ph, q->ph ) );
      p->bNew = HB_FALSE;
   }

   hbqt_par_QLayout( 1 )->addItem( hbqt_par_QLayoutItem( 2 ) );
}
...
</CODE>  

c. THbQtUI.prg with the corrected sequence:
...
HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, 101 )
   ::oWidget:close()
HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, 102 )
   ::oWidget := NIL
HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, 103 )
   hbide_justACall( i )
   RETURN NIL
...

Probably this is not the solution. 
Automatic destruction in any way is the real problem, so 
will enhance it rather then pacifying. I may be wrong.

No need, we have already tried with it in the past.

BTW, after applying all your patches and cleaning hbXBP and hbIDE 
code, where few objects were hanging around and few were wrongly 
implemented, I can now get two RTEs ( yes, it is strange but true, 2 RTEs )
at the very end of hbIDE exit : 
Error BASE/1301 Object destructor failure: Reference to freed block.
Error BASE/1301 Object destructor failure: Reference to freed block.

and it is consistent and reproducable always.

One variable can be : static s_app in QApplication.cpp which 
according to Qt documentation should never be released by application 
code. The second error I cannot sense for which variable it could be.

I do not know should I commit the new cleaned up code or not ?

Instead of all the protections in hbQT's GC pointer items destruction
we are still unable to grasp a logic why for some variables behavior
is indifferent. I mean we are never sure which another child is 
destroyed by Qt with its parent and prevent the latter not to 
be sent to GC engine.

Few days before I had resuested for this feature, though I admit,
I could not explain that in as simple language as above of your paragraph.
If possible, please do it.

Welcome back, we really missed you.

Though above solution is exactly what effectively handles the 
situation, and you have well described it, it is not the only part 
where it may fail. Such scenarios can be many, especially when 
we are handelling .uic files at the prg level. Also it requires a 
manual update of such methods on .qth levels, which in 
my opinion is not the right solution.

Przemek's second option is to introduce GC items dependant on
some other is the right direction to go.

For now I am including above patch in my tests.
And if it resolves crashes with the updated code, I will commit.
Later we will be waiting for Przemek's commit to see it the same 
is done on GC levels.

OK, sounds good. In any case if it fits to our needs is better than nothing temporarily. It's sufficient to solve the scenario just for the linked non QObject-s.
In the future we should switch the QPointer-s to QWeakPointer-s, covering in this way probably the non QObject-s too, but this looks to be a long way.

Best regards,

Did you test this code ? I think, yes.
Then prg level :addItem() method is missing, how you solved that?
Manually writing in TQLayout.prg ?

Yes, you are right, and the crash is gone on my Fedora12.

I replaced just QLayout.cpp.

Hi to everybody,

I tried to solve the problem starting from the end, the delete... I
wanted to intercept the delete and from the pointer going back to the
harbour QGC_POINTER and "nullify" it.... From the end you cover all
cases in a generic way..

Your solution is from another point of view, you "disable" the delete
statement when GC destructor is called on children  so the only way to
REALLY destroy a child is to wait for parent deletion... this may
solve some problems but, as said and as I understood your sample, we
may have deveral hanging objects...

Is it also necessary to implement the same logic for addWidget, but
also a inverted logic for removeWidget and removeItem...

More, we need to devise a standard way to generate such code from
qth/include files....  from the actual generator I think it is very
difficult, we should create an in-memory structure of calls and then
generate code as automatically as possible...

Anyway, congratulations for the finding...

Francesco

Yes, you are right, this patch is just the first step in the crash hunting.
The next steps should be oriented to a more general dynamic approach.

This is an important patch because it started a new way for solving GPF...

Now there are several protections against GPFs...

- guarded pointers for objects deriving from QObject
- your way when objects are "parented" at runtime
- second parameter of *_gcAllocate_* set to false

Still missing is full check on parameter types but Przemek already
gave some ideas...

Hi Istvan,
in your sample code there is:
HB_FUNC( QT_QLAYOUT_ADDITEM )
{
  QGC_POINTER * p;
  QGC_POINTER * q;

  HB_TRACE( HB_TR_DEBUG, ( "Entering function QT_QLAYOUT_ADDITEM()" ) );

  q = ( QGC_POINTER * ) hb_parptrGC( hbqt_gcFuncs(), 1 );
  p = ( QGC_POINTER * ) hb_parptrGC( hbqt_gcFuncs(), 2 );

...

hbqt_par_QLayout( 1 )->addItem( hbqt_par_QLayoutItem( 2 ) )



My proposal is to change hb_parptrGC with the proper function call
hbqt_par_QLayout/hbqt_par_QLayoutItem so to apply, in the future,
hierarchy checks...

and
hbqt_par_QLayout( 1 )->addItem( hbqt_par_QLayoutItem( 2 ) )
to
(q)->addItem( p )

wget  is to download web pages/files (but also ftp). It downloads the

execute the file ./MBaggharbour2_svn . Storically the local directory
is not included in the path automatically so you have to indicate a

About apt-get: there is usually the possibility to download/install
different versions of the same package, - something is supported
sometimes not. For example (it's just an example !) you may have
installed Qt3 and Qt4 on the same pc, but only one version of 4 and
3... can't have 4.2 and 4.3 ! (I repeat, it may be ok for Qt but not
for other packages, was just a sample)

Yes, my code snippet is just a wrapped one to demonstrate the problem. My
goal is to show the problem not to solve it. I will check time to time this
list sporadic as I am busy with other issues, but in any case I am happy to
see the immense effort of Pritpal and others to make harbour graphical
solution more attractive and robust. 

Thank you and best regards,

More observations.

The errors above are reported if I enter and exit hbIDE in quick succession.
But if I keep open hbIDE for a couple of minutes ( without doing anything 
or do whatever I want ) and then exit, it _does_not_ showup any RTE.

I m guessing that some objects are still under _construction_ by Qt, and
those
pointers are either locked or pretended as so by Qt and and hence GC 
tries to free them. It is puzzling but it is. I believe that this happens in
cases
when we are creating lists or tables containing large entries.

This update is just to inform you the latest findings.

Let's wait for an upload containing a variant of my wrapped fix and we will

Hi,

[SPA]

Para Encriptar/Desencriptar, a traves de:

? "DBI_ENCRYPT - barneyrubble", dbcrypt->( dbinfo( 
DBI_ENCRYPT,"barneyrubble" ) )

?necesariamente la tabla tiene que abrirse en modo exclusivo?

?Qu? otras funciones de DBINFO requieren el modo exclusivo?

[ENG] By Google
To encrypt / decrypt, through:

? "DBI_ENCRYPT - barneyrubble" dbcrypt-> (dbinfo (DBI_ENCRYPT, 
"barneyrubble"))

Necessarily the table has to be opened in exclusive mode?

What other functions require exclusively dbinfo?


TIA

BestRegards

Istvan,
in hbide.prg Pritpal implemented a "controlled" destroy of objects. He
tried to sequence the destroy to release the children objects first...
Disabling this long list of :destroy() and implementing your changes
for all the cases where necessary, we should get a working program
with no GPFs...

Since I'm trying to implement your changes in the generator, if you
have a better version please send...

Sorry Pritpal, you were correct.
In the QLayout.qth file proposed by Istvan the line of addItem is
commented and so the harbour class is not generated...

My post doesn't contain any other info. I am happy if you can find the
solution in the generator part.

Since I got GPF in another point (removing the :destroy() part) of the
code (releasing a QToolBar) I used the trace above to see what
function calls were done on that QToolBar... they are
addAction
toggleViewAction
setIcon

at least one of them must have the change you proposed....

My experience is that the Qt objects should be released by a controlled
pointer zeroing in the prg level, otherwise we are facing to GPF-s (not
analyzed harbour internals...).

I get a lot of warnings building latest Harbour from SVN. Do I have to 
report all of them or they are expected?

Ok, just for trying to understand how it is possible to proceed and to
validate the idea I did some tests... I was able to remove a GPFs
changing some add* functions.
It was a manual work and I strongly believe it can't be done manually !

Just for reference I post here one of this changed functions, for code review:

HB_FUNC( QT_QMAINWINDOW_ADDTOOLBAR )
{
   QGC_POINTER_QMainWindow * q;
   QGC_POINTER * p;

   HB_TRACE( HB_TR_DEBUG, ("QMAINWINDOW_ADDTOOLBAR" ) );

   q = ( QGC_POINTER_QMainWindow * ) hb_parptrGC( hbqt_gcFuncs(), 1 );
   p = ( QGC_POINTER * ) hb_parptrGC( hbqt_gcFuncs(), 3 );

   if ( p && p->ph && q && q->ph )
   {
     HB_TRACE( HB_TR_DEBUG, ( "QT_QMAINWINDOW_ADDTOOLBAR() Qt oject:
%p is attached to: %p", (void *) p->ph, (void *) q->ph) );
     p->bNew = HB_FALSE;
     if ( q && q->ph )
       ( q->ph )->addToolBar( ( Qt::ToolBarArea ) hb_parni( 2 ), ( (
QToolBar *) p->ph ));
     else
       HB_TRACE( HB_TR_DEBUG, ( "F=QT_QMAINWINDOW_ADDACTION FP=( q->ph
)->addAction( xx ); q->ph is NULL" ));
  }
}

I committed taht operations and it took a while to install all packages.
In between there were some prompts, one being asking about I want "clean
install",
which I confirmed to "Y" ( do not know if it was right ? just went by my
poor wisdome ).
Also it asked for password for couple of times ( I am not sure why more than
once 
after logging in ).

I could see hbide compiling.
But at the end, oops, could not find -lhbqt.


to run hbide type:

./hbide


Whole effort defeated.


Hope this helps


Partially.

If we go this way, i.e., manually changing the code, then 
probably we can never finish, nor anybody will take interest in.
There can be thousands of combinations like this.

We should wait until Przemek commits detachable GC pointers.

You are near to have all working you need only to verify the harbour hbqt
lib is compiled and installed on your system

Please verify if there is  the harbour hbqt lib in your system:

- Update the locate files index database, to be sure it have latest
installed or compiled files in it open a terminal from
Application?Accessories?Terminal and type or copy and paste:

sudo /etc/cron.daily/mlocate;

Then still using terminal use the locate command to search the libqt files
(filtering only the files within "lib" in the result)

locate hbqt | grep -i lib

In my Ubuntu 9.10 i get this result, yuo must have this lib installed
(compiled):

...
/usr/lib/harbour/libhbqt.a
/usr/lib/harbour/libhbqtcore.a
/usr/lib/harbour/libhbqtgui.a
/usr/lib/harbour/libhbqtnetwork.a

Feel free to send me privately the result of all commands (you can repeat
and check for errors all of them without any damage on your Ubuntu
installation for example repeat ./MB)

This command will download and compile Harbour from svn

cd $HOME/src
./MBaggharbour2_svn

         - new wce/msvcarm: -EHsc-

      The only place this could be needed ATM is hbqt, so pls report

      proper usage of these options.
      NOTE: These options were already left out from hbmk2.

      (deleted bogus -Od and some other options)

My fault the MBaggharbour2_svn shell script don't create the hbqt lib i have
tested and update it please download and run:

mkdir $HOME/src
cd $HOME/src
wget http://www.elart.it/harbour/MBaggharbour2_svn
chmod 700 MBaggharbour2_svn
./MBaggharbour2_svn

or simply if you already have the directory structure:

cd $HOME/src
wget http://www.elart.it/harbour/MBaggharbour2_svn
chmod 700 MBaggharbour2_svn
./MBaggharbour2_svn

Hope this helps,
best regards

Marco

    + This commit includes Francesco Perillo's patch, after applying some 
      formatting and leaving what did not worked.
    + Includes Istvan's concept of child detachment, but not made active still.
    - Deleted many objects which were created in early days of hbIDE development.
    + Changed the way QApplication's init/exit procedures were implemented.
      Now the behavior is accurate.
    + Applied some more control over object destruction placement.
    + Plus a lot of optimizations I cannot jot down exactly.

    Basically, this commit aims at locating the GPF at exit. Now instead of 
    GPF, we receive two RTE's at the end, if exiting hbIDE at the quick 
    succession. But if you have worked into it for few seconds, it exits 
    normally. Please test.

    David, the QPixmap bug in hbXBP on OS2 was a bug in hbXBP and is fixed.
    You can test it again to verify if I am correct.

No, I was wrong, there is GPF at any HBQTUI:destroy() call.
I was not looking at console. For mee GPF is always reported 
as a windows dialog, but with linux it is different behavior.

  * contrib/hbqt/qtgui/QLayout.cpp

  * contrib/hbqt/generator/hbqtgen.prg
    + Implemented to pick function body from .qth headers and 
      posted exactly the same within .cpp. Like:
        QLayout.qth
         
          bool activate ()      //  some method before
          virtual void addItem ( QLayoutItem * item ){
            // Code publishes by Istavin.
          }
          void addWidget ( QWidget * w ) // some method after or none

      Note for the opening and closing braces. These must be 
      last character of the method header and first character 
      of the methods last and separate line. 

      This feature facilitates to put the code dierect in headers 
      where we cannot generate it in automated way. This feature is 
      strongly discouraged to be used heavily.

Hi Gurus,

I'm trying to port one of our Clipper applications to Harbour which uses a
lot of functions from Funcky II, DCLIP 4, and ESC 40 libraries. Do we have
an equivalent libraries for these ?

Thanks,

Pritpal,
beware about the fact that the QTabWidget.cpp you committed was not
created by the generator, at least not the last one !

In order to change one function, every function was modified....

Study ideeditor.prg.

These methods are relevant:

METHOD IdeEditsManager:printPreview()
   LOCAL qDlg
   IF ! empty( ::qCurEdit )
      qDlg := QPrintPreviewDialog():new( ::oDlg:oWidget )
      qDlg:setWindowTitle( "Harbour-QT Preview Dialog" )
      Qt_Slots_Connect( ::pSlots, qDlg, "paintRequested(QPrinter)", {|p|
::paintRequested( p ) } )
      qDlg:exec()
      Qt_Slots_disConnect( ::pSlots, qDlg, "paintRequested(QPrinter)" )
   ENDIF
   RETURN self

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------*/

METHOD IdeEditsManager:paintRequested( pPrinter )
   LOCAL qPrinter
   qPrinter := QPrinter():configure( pPrinter )
   ::qCurEdit:print( qPrinter )
   RETURN Self

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------*/


And change 

::qCurEdit:print( qPrinter )
=>
qTextDocument:print( qPrinter )


Above is a generic idea. You may need to hook :printPreview()
method above to some pushbutton where qTextDocument is also visible, and 
then adopt to your needs.

I've just rebuild everything under Ubuntu 32bit 10.04 beta2+ and
distro's libqt4-dev ( 4.6.2 ) and both hbide and hbqt/tests/demoqt
seem to work WITHOUT GPFs starting, closing and clicking here and
there.

Hi,

These functions were deleted, delete them also 
from your own source code, or use the up to date 
version of all the Harbour libs.

 page != terminal code page
Message-ID: <1A07FEDC778C3E4AA417F089511F859C1D90CF8D42@Mail-yoq.SYNEL-COMPANY.LTD>

Was a way for a few days (got around 70 more Harbour digest to read),
so I don't know if this is still relevant:

Zsolt Bartos-Elekes posted the following:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=100681&aid=2987157&group_id=681
------------------
Harbour version 2.0.0
gcc (Debian 4.3.2-1.1) 4.3.2
Debian GNU/Linux 5.0.4-amd64 (Lenny)
Linux 2.6.33.1 x86_64

The following program reads spaces into variables even if no keys are pressed if
code page != terminal code page:

REQUEST HB_LANG_HUISO
REQUEST HB_CODEPAGE_HUISO

REQUEST HB_LANG_HU852
REQUEST HB_CODEPAGE_HU852

HB_LANGSELECT("HU852")
HB_SETCODEPAGE("HU852")
HB_SETTERMCP("HUISO")

? "Language:           ",HB_LANGSELECT()
? "Code page:          ",HB_SETCODEPAGE()

clear gets

var1=space(20)
var2=space(20)

@ 5,0 say "var1" get var1
@ 6,0 say "var2" get var2

read

@ 8,0 say ""

? var1
? var2

The problem is with the src/codepage/uc*.c files,
most if not all of them map the code page's first character
(character code 0x00) to U+0x0020 (space).
Changing them to U+0x0000 resolves the problem.

I just add Hbnetio to my sample aplicattion and all works ok

after , I change this

pSockSrv := netio_mtserver( DBPORT,,, /* RPC */ .T., DBPASSWD )

In your sample DBPORT is a numeric data , but I need to put it in an string
format to work ok

But the only think that I can't make to work it is DBcreate , the program
still create database in his own folder

instead data server folder , what do you think I am doing wrong ?

this is my prg code to create database

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I just correct the way that i call the name of database on create

and this solve the problem .

How is the correct way to create an index database and check if exist

using netio ?

Thanks and this is a great work

What operating system and compiler?

Here with bcc it generates 'abnormal program termination'
as noted in '2010-04-09 20:37 UTC+0200'.

Sorry, unfortunately I still have the same problem I have now done a clean
install (rev.14347) and continued getting the same error about these
functions, when I try to compile hbxbp\tests\hbmk2 hbxbp.prg.

And this is part demoxbp.prg file content (at least mine), lines 242 to 254:

/* Very important - destroy resources */
   HBXBP_DEBUG( "----------------------------------------------" )
   HBXBP_DEBUG( "Before    ::oDlg:destroy()", memory( 1001 ),
hbqt_getMemUsed() )
   HBXBP_DEBUG( "----------------------------------------------" )

   oDlg:destroy()
   oHTM := NIL

   HBXBP_DEBUG( "----------------------------------------------" )
   HBXBP_DEBUG( "After     ::oDlg:destroy()", memory( 1001 ),
hbqt_getMemUsed() )
   HBXBP_DEBUG( "----------------------------------------------" )

HBXBP_DEBUG( "------------------------------ WOW
---------------------------------" )

Thanks

Okay, so the error isn't really with building hbxbp, but with demoxbp.
I will delete these calls in a next commit.

Hi Przemek,

Confirming the fix you have just committed had solved the GPF problem.  
Many thanks!

Thank you also Viktor for looking into this.  I'm using BCC58/Win7-64.

Do you mean a CVS ubuntu package ?

I can do an upload to internet

I am not familiar with Linux terminology yet.
So cannot distinguish what CVS package means.
I am looking for a single file, like a Windows installer,
which a user can download and install on his 
Linus box and executes the hbIDE without building.

If possible, sent it to me on my mail.

application over internet
Terminal allows remote execution of 32-bit Windows applications
working in graphic mode .
The Terminal server launches the application on the application server

as windows, menus or icons, to the terminal system, thus allowing
effective remote execution

is/will possible also use in a browser like web application?
is/will possible compress comunication?

Every distro uses it's own packaging system.
It's allmost a religious wars among linux developpers about wich is better.
Ubuntu is Debian's based so what you need is a .deb file.
Other distros uses .rpm files
So for linux you need 1 installer for each major distro.
Remember Linux is a Bazaar so you will find a lot of everything 
(packaging systems, desktops, etc) and there is no way to satisfy every 
linux user on the planet.

Angel , i know what do you mean , but ubuntu is one of the most used
distro

May me another user could make SVN package for Suse or RedHat etc etc

IN another way , Pritpal need a binary package for HBIDE with QT dependecys

which is more dificult to do , may be Marco Braida it is in Capacity to make
such package

or another Ubuntu user .

The other way is to add hbide to binary package as standard , but this need
to generate

dependencies to QT libraries in linux

Hi,

Distribution of standalone apps (not contained in 
package repositories) on Linux is in the dark age.

For a possible solution to the problem, check the 
installer of Google Earth for Linux. It's nothing 
standard, but it seems to work in a generic and 
user-friendly way. [ Another candidate could be 
Skype for Linux, but I didn't check it more 
closely. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

Yes but these package is not ok for end user and Linux can't find it

you need the ubuntu package libqtcore4 , libqtgui4 , libqt4-network ,
libqt4-webkit

may be I am forgeting anyone.

These libraries are needed to execute HBIDE compiled dinamic in linux

Could be a solution, but one preceding part of the problem 
is to create Linux binaries + required external dependent 
libs not necessarily found on all systems (f.e. QT libs) 
in a way which is portable between systems and installable 
into any directory location.

Brgds,

BTW, in case of HBIDE it could make packaging easier to 
build it against static QT libs. HBIDE is fully free 
software so this is legal.

[ This is also true for Windows / OS/2, of course. ]

The test of installer it is ok  , works very well

But I need to know exactly who libraries need to add to the project

None, never explored the topic on Linux.

Some googling could give answers. First thing 
to check is whether Linux has static QT lib 
package ready to install. If not, and needs to 
be built from source, it will be too much of a 
pain to be useful.

Brgds,
Viktor

Yep. I update it as time permits.

It is exact matching with Xbase++ 1.90 documentation and user 
is encouraged to read that. Probably it is a big challenge to write all
that again.

There are a couple of "semi-standard" way of installing packages in unix

a) tar + manual modification
b) self-executable

a) tar
it's just like a zip, you untar (unzip) it from a specific location
and then set some variables (PATH, ld.conf (pointing to libraries) etc

b) self-executable shell script
There is a "feature" of the shell script that allows you to write a
file from the program, something like this:
echo > filetowrite << ENDOFTEXT
1
2
3
ENDOFTEXT
This script will create file filetowrite with text enclosed by
ENDOFTEXT.... In this way you can embed multiple files in one.
The program will also set PATH, add library directory and so on... but
it must do so based on the unix/linux distribution...


HP-UX has a method
Solaris has a method (pkgadd)

Suse and others have rpm
others use apt-get


In order to not have problems a static version is the way to go....

Yes. I wonder what dependencies QT libs themselves have?

Hi Pritpal,

in "The Origin" this sentence:
"Francesco: suggested to integrate "Eclipse" which he thought, and 
others supported, is a great tool, but also expressed that he has no 
knowledge, so far, how it can be integrated with Harbour."

AFAIR has to be attributed to Lorenzo. I never used Eclipse (if the name 
refers to me).

About the tool, I found it very interesting, also if, as Massimo stated, 
it doesn't permit to bookmark pages. Is there is any way to jump 
directly to a single page.

As per hbide, your work is very impressive. Thank you and go ahead.
As told privately I'm checking harbour time-by-time, but I hope I will 
back in short time and help.

Best regards,
Francesco

Oh, I missed a point. Actually it was Francesco Perillo, not you.

Thank you.
I will be looking for your return to Harbour, definitely, we 
need more gifted brains to push this project forward. Hope 
everybody is fine in your family.

Well... tar can be used to read from tapes... and in the past a
command "cpio" was widely used for installations....

I remember to have read that there are no strange dependencies other
than "standard" cpp libraries...

But you need to recompile Qt library and it is not without problems
(and sometimes you won't get a completely static executable)

I have found a workaround.

Right-click on the topic node in left panel, 
and from the context menu select "Add to favourities..".

This solves the issue, but still I am looking for regular
method and has posted message on HM newsgroup.

There are a lot of Linux distribution

.deb debian packages (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)
.rpm redhat and derivates

are the main systems automated package distribution

To create a rpm package for hbide i think Premzek is the right person to ask
to.

I have already done some deb package from harbour compiled executable for
Ubuntu i will try to make a deb package to install and update hbide in the
next days.

To auto convert rpm to deb or deb to rpm on Ubuntu we can try alien here an
example

sudo alien -r mb-ubuntu-optimizer_119-1_i386.deb

-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 533162 2010-04-20 11:40
mb-ubuntu-optimizer_119-1_i386.deb
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root   535541 2010-04-20 11:40
mb-ubuntu-optimizer-119-1.i386.rpm

I made a suggestion regarding hbide
Finish/Explain xharbour/clipper support
Finish wizard for create new project
Remove welcome screen in particular when load from command line hbide
mytest.hbp
Automatic tag in Function lookup

Possible a theme with color like Visual studio 2010 and  keyboard mapping in
editor function:
msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/da5kh0wa(v=VS.100).aspx#editors

3 toolbar are a lot, possible remove one?
very good use of tab in right& Left screen when you open Multiple function
like Documentation,function list ,Project Properties..
Now toolbar will be included inside right & left screen (last row)
Better having toolbar as first,last row
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/da5kh0wa(v=VS.100).aspx#editors>In
keboard mapping i not able execute at f12  exectool("calc.exe")

-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1384942 2010-04-20 14:33 hbide_14350-1_i386.deb
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1387292 2010-04-20 14:34 hbide-14350-1.i386.rpm

with this ( to be checked standard contents ) contents:

 dpkg --contents hbide_14350-1_i386.deb
drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2010-04-20 14:30 ./

and this package infos ( please note i have not standard qt lib on this pc,
i will make the final package on another pc):

 Description: Ide for Harbour.
  An ide tool to create compile maintain software project
  created with Harbour.
  This app was written using Harbour Clipper compiler
  http://www.harbour-project.org


i need to perform some internal test.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please suggest the dependency packages to add to this package...
Also we must have some doc dir to include might be wonderful some complete
project sample, copyright and other...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then we need to ask to debian mantainer to include harbour into debian
repository: we have already, thinking about it (with Bruno Luciani and
Massimo Belgrano) i have contacted the old maintainer of harbour but it
doesn't maintain harbour more.

We need to contact an official debian maintainer to get an inclusion of
harbour in the debian packages trees (then after a while harbour will be
also in Ubuntu release).

Best regards,
Marco

You need to compile hbQT and hbXBP as well.
May be this could be the reason of above error.

On Ubuntu 9.10 I have rechecked after SVN update, 
it runs absolutely fine.

Just recompile hbQT and hbXBP.

Please tell is not enought to use this command...

hbmk2 hbide.hbp -rebuild

I think the starting issue is due to my qt environment not standard that i
use to compile qgis.

BTW in the past this command works.

Thank you, best regards
Marco

hbqt_init()/exit() function are responsible to initiatate static s_app.
QApplication() must ever be called as QApplication():new() and never 
as QApplication(). Also application must not initiate init/exit procedures
to call QApplication.

Function Main()
   Local oWnd
   local qApp
    
   qApp := QApplication():new()  /* ONLY IF YOU NEED TO SET APPLICATION WIDE
METHODS */

   oWnd := QMainWindow():new()
   // do other commands
   // To set application wide variables, qApp:setOverrideCursor()
   // Initiate an event loop and exit from this event loop will call the
s_app:quit()

  return nil


I mean you must not call qApp:exec() and qApp:quit() as it is handlled on
.cpp level.

This was a majot cause of GPF at exit.

I try to make an HBIDE installer , the software that i use works ok

but the problem is that i can't put the needed libraries , in his place
/usr/lib

of the machine where I am installing on.

If I install all in a directory , linux don't find the libraries.

hbmk2 hbide.hbp -rebuild

specifies that hbIDE is rebuild. It does not instruct to 
build hbQT and hbXBP, which BTW is only required when there 
are changes in those libs. In the last few commits I did some 
major changes in these libs. So probably if you make clean once
you never need to issue 

hbmk2 hbide.hbp -rebuild 

at all.

Also the application dir is not good?

Hi Pritpal,

Can this be somehow fixed to be fool-proof on the app level?

It's still not a good thing to let anything on .prg level to 
cause GPFs.

I don't find the way to put libraries in his place
I don't know exactly the order , but /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib are places

that linux search for libraries , the problem is that i don't find a way to
indicates to the installer

which files need to be copied in this directory

I have separated in two groups executable related files and libraries files
and set destination to /usr/lib

but installer don't copy libraries to his place , despite of I am executing
installer in sudo root mode

You give me some idea in wath resolve this

Linux search looking at /etc/ld.so.conf   ( paths where search libraries )

and I see the way that harbour set his own librarie and it is adding a file
called harbour.conf

to /etc/ld.so-conf.d/   folder

I could try the same but using a file called hbide.conf

Tonight I test it

This is exactly for what I changed QApplication() protocol.

Just do not have any init/exit procedures initiating QApplication at all
in prg code. It is done automatically at cpp level.

This is because we do not have control over which init procedure 
will execute first.

Call them like this ( even not needed ):

INIT PROCEDURE Qt_Start()

   hbqt_errorsys()

   RETURN

Function Main()
   
   /* You can even skip this also unless you are setting some appl level
methods*/
   s_qApp := QApplication():new() 

   // Event Loop

   Return Nil

Pritpal, ok now, was double installation of libs

one in /usr/local/lib/harbour/

and the updated lib in

/usr/lib/harbour/

so removed the

/usr/local/lib/harbour/

and compiled wtth

hbmk2 hbide.hbp -rebuild -L/usr/lib/harbour

and hbide works fine.

Thank you

I'm not sure I understand, the GPF was reported using the 
most recent revision. Are you saying the possibility of the
mentioned GPF is now fixed?

Okay, I got that part. All I'm saying is that it's still 
a sign of .prg code (whatever .prg code) is still causing 
GPF for some reason:

---
Unrecoverable error 6005: Exception SIGSEGV at address 0x10004
Called from QT_QAPPLICATION_EXEC(0)
Called from QAPPLICATION:EXEC(0) in ../../../TQApplication.prg
Called from MAIN(195) in ./source/us_editor_new.prg
bruno@notebook:~/marinas-ide/editor/source$ 
---

Couldn't there be an RTE issued instead?

Brgds,
Viktor

It is a case of which init procedure is executed first.
If you have PRG level INIT which calls QApplication():new(), 
it will simply return s_app as hb_retptr( s_app ) which 
may/may not be a valid one depending upon if PRG level 
init procedure is executed first or .cpp level one.

That was the reason Bruno got this error sometimes only.

BTW user has never to know to initialize the application at all.

Previous implementation was wrong anyway.

Hi

I think all IDE components need to free to be put in any place, specially
with 2 monitors. Now I work with 2x 1280x1024 but I am buying 2 new monitors
to work on portrait position (2x 1200x1920).

Keyboard mapping for all components and many others things need to be
configurable too. For me, IDE was born to be flexible.

Column mode is absolutely necessary.

I will try do real use with HBIDE this week to review it.

Also without the deb installer you can test by yourself in your Ubuntu env
the errors by manually copying the
$HOME/src/harbour/contrib/hbide to the /usr/bin/ dir with this command:

sudo cp $HOME/src/harbour/contrib/hbide/hbide /usr/bin/.
sudo chown root.root /usr/bin/hbide

To cheche your permission in that file type
ls -la /usr/bin/hbide

My permissions are
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 5597736 2010-04-21 01:39 /usr/bin/hbide


Hope this helps

It is there.
Just click on "Float" button on any of the docking widgets ( right-side )
only.
The window becomes independent and you can place them anywhere you want.
Also next run will remember previous positions and will open there when
invoked.

It is there with more flexibility.
In coming days it will be enhanced to accomodate many more public API
methods.

This is one dark-area I have not been able to find a solution yet.
But the efforts are ON and hopefully some-day I will succeed.

It is there. Just Mark the projects first time.
Next time these will be loaded automatically.
One-time tagging is a must. Remmeber to "Mark"
other projects also as and when those are needed.

Why so? 
If you want it like that, just hide a toolbar from <MenuBar><View>
and next time it will not show up.

This is one area I am not conversant with.
Someone has to tweak location paths in hbIDE overall structure.
It is pity that you are restricted in so many ways in Linux.

So what I feel is better to propogate Harbour installation including hbIDE.

So, is it possible for HBQT to throw proper RTE, in 
case NULL is returned here? I think it's much better 
than a GPF.

It won't solve the problem, since Harbour itself 
can also be installed into system dirs, where 
you cannot just store volatile configuration 
data as well.

Actually this is not a Linux "thing", in most 
modern operating systems they tend to store 
programs and configuration data in separate 
areas, and this has several benefits. F.e. 
you can handle per user settings seamlessly.
This is important on any systems which is used 
by more than one user, not to mention terminal 
servers.

So the direction is to store data into '$HOME/.hbide/'
on *nix and to store such data in '%APPDATA%\hbide\'
dir on Windows systems.

Of course it's always a good thing to allow for 
"portable" installation (f.e. on USB drives), 
where app and data resides in the same directory 
structure, and currently this is exactly what 
hbide support. The problem is that's the only 
method it supports.

Brgds,
Viktor

Pritpal you simply need to create, if not exist, a $HOME/.hbide dir and then
use that dir to store hbide itself data or other not volatile infos for
example the hbide .ini files

Then project data related to single project can be stored without
restrictions in any place into user file structure.

Then the user can easily save the $HOME data with all setting and all owned
files in it.
If you need to write in a all user writable temporary dir you can also use
the system /tmp/ directory.

Is one of the best features that i like on *nix this is really a very good
system protection feature

It isn't absolutely related to Harbour.
Viktor has esplained better than me in this thread.

Here something to have the *nix shell user environment var values:

function main
qout("User login name $USER ----------------------------------> " +
getenv('USER'))
qout("Home of user $HOME var ---------------------------------> " +
getenv('HOME'))
qout("User default program search $PATH var ------------------> " +
getenv('PATH'))
qout("User is member of this groups result of groups command -> ");
HB_PROCESSOPEN( 'groups'  )
qout("Below the result of the env command")
qout("----------------------------------------------------------")
qout("")
HB_PROCESSOPEN( 'env'  )

I set it for .ini invokation : hbide hbide.ini.
For .prg(s) it was already like that.
For .hbp, it cannot be because I do not save the previous state.

It works. You need to be inside active editing instance for 
these macros to work. Do some other key work ?

Try ::execTool( "calc.exe", "", "", .f., .f. )

I am ageing, so missed a point to mention in previous post.

hbIDE already supports the location of .ini files if user supplies it as 
first parameter to it :
   hbide.exe $HOME/_some_user_folder_/hbide.ini

For Windows I always run hbIDE from destop-icon(s) pointing to 
different locations of hbide.ini.

Other files, viz., hbide.skl, hbide.scu and hbide.env inherits from 
such location if not set their location explicitly.

However I never tried with %AppData% like variables, but in theory 
these should be respected by OS, no.

Suggestions are welcome as to tweak this part if what I explained 
above is not useful.

Do you plane save state of opened file in each project?
Xmate remember also row selected when save file/project

Sorry, but I can't see what you mean by "respected".
You can read them using GETENV( "APPDATA" ).

While the cmdline configuration option you mention above 
is nice, it's still not a solution to this problem.

Instead IMO you could do something like this:

FUNCTION DetectIniPath()

   IF ! hb_FileExists( hb_dirBase() + "hbide.ini" )
   #if defined( __PLATFORM__WINDOWS )
      RETURN GetEnv( "APPDATA" ) + "\hbide\" 
   #elif defined( __PLATFORM_UNIX )
      RETURN GetEnv( "HOME" ) + "/.hbide/"
   #endif
   ENDIF

   RETURN hb_dirBase()

And use the returned path as the base path for 
hbide.ini, .viz and the rest.

For the project base dir (and other default user 
directories), you should use GetEnv( "HOME" )
on *nix and GetEnv( "HOMEDRIVE" ) + GetEnv( "HOMEPATH" ) 
for Windows.

There is a <Save> button on keyboard mappings dialog, use it.

Thanks, this seems to be right solution.
One point, however is, what if this path does not exists.
What function is appropriate for creating folder ?

You can use MAKEDIR().

Sorry i still bad explain
You can not remove welcome screen because not have  the previous state.

but web have in mind different significance for state

Save state is only valid if I know the location 
which is why it can be retained when it is invoked by hbide.ini.
XMate is only project based so it retains opened state always.

If I do so, then a lot of other issues are involved, which 
I could not cover properly. This is the only foolproof way to 
implement like this. In reality, whenever you are not on 
"Welcome" screen, you are always in some editing instance,
so I do not see any problems.

Oh, Ok. 
Does MakeDir() also supports nested paths ?
Or only the last folder ?

It doesn't support nested paths. Though for 
the purpose we currently discuss, nested 
paths aren't needed, as you only have to 
create 'hbide' dir inside an existing dir.

Here is the modified version.
Please let me know if it needs refinements:

FUNCTION hbide_getIniPath( cHbideIni )
   LOCAL cPath, cIni

   IF empty( cHbideIni )
      IF ! hb_FileExists( cIni := hb_dirBase() + "hbide.ini" )
      #if defined( __PLATFORM__WINDOWS )
         cPath := GetEnv( "APPDATA" ) + "\hbide\"
      #elif defined( __PLATFORM_UNIX )
         cPath := GetEnv( "HOME" ) + "/.hbide/"
      #endif
         IF ! hb_dirExists( cPath )
            MakeDir( cPath )
         ENDIF
         cIni := cPath + "hbide.ini"
      ENDIF
   ELSE
      cIni := cHbideIni
   ENDIF

   RETURN cIni


The previous implementation was:

   IF empty( cHbideIni )
      IF hb_fileExists( "hbide.ini" )
         cHbideIni := "hbide.ini"
      ELSE
         cHbideIni := hb_dirBase() + "hbide.ini"
      ENDIF
   ENDIF
   oIde:cProjIni := cHbideIni

new :
   oIde:cProjIni := hbide_DetectIniPath( cHbideIni )

cHbideIni  is command-line supplied ini path.

Hi Pritpal,

It looks fine.

One more thing, not critical: it'd be better to 
use 'hbide_DirAddPathSep( GetEnv( "..." ) ) + "hbide\"'
instead of 'GetEnv( "..." ) + "\hbide\"', to avoid 
adding double slashes, in case the envvar already 
has it. (for *nix and win branches as well)

If I understood your message properly,
are you saying that hbIDE should report if it is wrong script 
at the time when we define it ? Right ?

If yes, then it is not possible. hbIDE only checks for the 
syntax at the time it is defined and actually by-pass if it not 
valid calls at the time it is invoked.

Or I musunderstood you ?

 IF( Empty( cTopic := ::GetText() ), cTopic := ::GetWord(.F.) ),
::exeTool( "hh.exe", "C:\xHB\Doc\xHarbour Language Reference

I readded to hbide because i delete ini
Now hbIDE  report :
"wrongly defined script,try:|v|::method(v)"
What can do?

"wrongly defined script,try:|v|::method(v)"
alert is issued when at definition time hbIDE is unable to compile.
Check your syntax, it is wrong somewhere.

BTW keyboard mappings is not dependant on hbide.ini.

Try

|cTopic|
iif( empty( cTopic := ::GetText() ), cTopic := ::GetWord(.F.) ),
iif( empty( cTopic ), cTopic := "" ), 
::exeTool( "hh.exe", "C:\xHB\Doc\xHarbour Language Reference Guide.chm" +
"::" + cTopic )


It should work.
Note : check for cTopic is a valid character variable.

This is the exact way ( you missed some characters )


|cTopic| 
cTopic := ::GetText(), 
iif( empty( cTopic ), cTopic := ::GetWord(.F.), NIL),
iif( empty( cTopic ), cTopic := "", NIL), 
::execTool( "hh.exe", 
"C:\xHB\Doc\xHarbour Language Reference Guide.chm" + 
":" + ":" + cTopic )


The above is tested one as is and working.

  * contrib/hbide/idesaveload.prg
    + Implemented: hbIDE data files to be saved/retrieved in 
      system folders if hbide.ini with path is not supplied 
      on the command-line. The following algorythm is used:

      FUNCTION hbide_getIniPath( cHbideIni )
         LOCAL cPath, cIni

         IF empty( cHbideIni )
            IF ! hb_FileExists( cIni := hb_dirBase() + "hbide.ini" )
            #if defined( __PLATFORM__WINDOWS )
               cPath := hbide_DirAddPathSep( GetEnv( "APPDATA" ) ) + "hbide\"
            #elif defined( __PLATFORM_UNIX )
               cPath := hbide_DirAddPathSep( GetEnv( "HOME" ) ) + ".hbide/"
            #endif
               IF ! hb_dirExists( cPath )
                  MakeDir( cPath )
               ENDIF
               cIni := cPath + "hbide.ini"
            ENDIF
         ELSE
            cIni := cHbideIni
         ENDIF

         RETURN cIni
 
      This change makes hbIDE to be able to run on any system
      installed via an installer where a writable folder is expected 
      to write to application data.

      Thanks Viktor for the actual code and guidance.

Thanks Pritpal.

There is a typo (of mine):
  __PLATFORM_UNIX is missing an underscore: __PLATFORM__UNIX.

Hi

After commit from Windows, I have updated from Ubuntu 
and have found that constant __PLATFORM_UNIX is not defined somehow.

Can someone confirm or my setup is wrong ?

Now that hbqt seems more stable than before, I'd like to know if
someone is using hbqt for business-type applications, I mean "crud"
applications, ERP, accounting, etc....

Anyone wants to share some screenshots ?

I don't use it yet but I will use soon on a large ERP with
a sophisticated interface building way. I hope I can share ss later this
year.

It is too early to ask such question.
It is just the start of new era in Harbour. So far 
we struggled to make hbQT stable. hbIDE is one type 
of interface, business applications will be another.
And I see a positive progress towards its final journey.

May be we need more classes, prefereably XbpGet() to make 
it attractive for business applications. xbpBrowse() with TBrowse() 
like features is already there. Rest everything is ready. 
Maybe Shum or Angel can forward some real-time shots or 
code very soon.

Hi Pritpal:

There are 5 main things a bussines program does:

1) Imput Data
2) Save Data
3) Retrieve Data
4) Show Data
5) Print Data

Number 2 and 3 are topics harbour covers very well.

Number 4 and 5 I haven't tried yet

Number 1 I tried some months ago and result in a show stopper for me
I found no way to make a Get like screen navigable with Enter and cursor 
keys.
I also found no way to send messages between objects and keyboard method 
of some xhparts was not implemented.
So I decided to stop tests till the library got more developed.
At the same time GPS began to show up so I decided to wait for that to 
be resolved too.

Some time soon (I'm really full of work now) I will resume my xhparts 
based Business Progran Skeleton.
I hope this time Shum will join as  he is also an xbase++ expert.

Congratulations fo the good work Pritpal, soon you will see new tests on 
the subject.

Regards
Angel

  * src/rtl/achoice.prg
    ! Fixed to be more compatible with Clipper when passed wrong
      parameter types to ACHOICE(). (replacing DEFAULT TO usage
      with foolproof method)
    ! ACHOCIE() fixed to default dimensions to 0,0,0,0 like in Clipper.
    ! Fixed typo in ACHOICE() K_UP handling, which caused a bogus line
      to appear below the bottom when the height of the achoice area
      was only one line. Pls verify me for regressions.
    ! ACHOICE() fixed to immediately return zero (and position
      cursor) when wrong type or empty array was received as
      value array.
    ! Fixed minor inefficiency caused by wrongly calculated display
      area width when rightmost colums was out of screen in ACHOICE()
      call.

  * src/rtl/alert.prg
    + HB_ALERT() extended to support all variables types (not
      just strings) when an array is passed as first parameter:
        F.e.: HB_ALERT( { "hello", 100, .T. } )
    % Optimized out two local variables along the way.

Subject: [Harbour] Getting a list of printers under Linux
Message-ID: <13713.1271907185@people.net.au>

 I have just started on an interface to CUPS, only four functions so far
but already two ways to get a list of printers:

 CUPS_GETPRINTERS( array_to_be_filled )???? // based on the deprecated
function cupsGetPrinters()

 CUPS_GETDESTS( array_to_be_filled ) // based on cupsGetDests()

 c source code is as follows:

 // CUPS4HFunctions.c

 #include 
 #include 

 HB_FUNC( CUPS_GETDEFAULT )
 {
 ? const char *default_printer;
 ? default_printer = cupsGetDefault();
 ? if ( default_printer != NULL )
 ??? {
 ????? hb_retc( default_printer );
 ??? }
 ?? else
 ??? {
 ????? hb_ret();
 ??? }
 }

 HB_FUNC( CUPS_GETPRINTERS )
 {
 ? int num_printers;
 ? int c_index;
 ? int h_index;
 ? char **printer_list;
 ? PHB_ITEM pArray;

 ? pArray = hb_param( 1, HB_IT_ARRAY );
 ? num_printers = cupsGetPrinters( 
 ? hb_arraySize( pArray, ( ULONG ) num_printers );
 ? if ( num_printers > 0 )
 ??? {
 ????? for ( c_index = 0, h_index = 1; c_index < num_printers;
c_index++, h_index++ )
 ??????? {
 ????????? hb_storc( printer_list[c_index], 1, h_index );
 ??????? }? 
 ?
 ????? for ( c_index = 0; c_index < num_printers; c_index++ )
 ??????? {
 ????????? free( printer_list[c_index] );
 ??????? }? 
 ????? free( printer_list );?? 
 ??? }
 ? hb_retni( num_printers );
 }

 HB_FUNC( CUPS_GETDESTS )
 {
 ? int num_dests;
 ? int c_index;
 ? int h_index;
 ? ULONG length_of_name;
 ? cups_dest_t *dest_list, *dest;
 ? PHB_ITEM pArray;

 ? pArray = hb_param( 1, HB_IT_ARRAY );
 ? num_dests = cupsGetDests( 
 ? hb_arraySize( pArray, ( ULONG ) num_dests );
 ? if ( num_dests > 0 )
 ??? {
 ????? for (c_index = 0, h_index = 1, dest = dest_list; c_index <
num_dests; c_index++, h_index++, dest ++)
 ??????? {
 ????????? hb_storc( dest->name, 1, h_index );
 ??????? }
 ????? cupsFreeDests( num_dests, dest_list );?? 
 ??? }
 ? hb_retni( num_dests );
 }

 HB_FUNC( CUPS_PRINTFILE )
 {
 ? int jobID;
 ? 
 ? jobID = cupsPrintFile( hb_parc( 1 ), hb_parc( 2 ), hb_parc( 3 ), 0,
NULL );
 ? hb_retni( jobID );
 }

 To illustrate usage here is my first test program:

 // testcups4h.prg

 FUNCTION Main()

 ? LOCAL arr_Printers
 ? LOCAL int_PrinterCount

 ? ? CUPS_GetDefault()
 ? ?
 ? InKey( 0 )
 ? arr_Printers := Array( 0 )
 ? int_PrinterCount := CUPS_GetPrinters( arr_Printers )
 ? ? int_PrinterCount
 ? ?
 ? FOR i = 1 TO int_PrinterCount
 ??? ? arr_Printers[i]
 ? NEXT
 ? ?
 ? ? "End of list"
 ? ?
 ? InKey( 0 )
 ? arr_Printers := Array( 0 )
 ? int_PrinterCount := CUPS_GetDests( arr_Printers )
 ? ? int_PrinterCount
 ? ?
 ? FOR i = 1 TO int_PrinterCount
 ??? ? arr_Printers[i]
 ? NEXT
 ? ?
 ? ? "End of list"
 ? ?
 ? InKey( 0 )
 ? ? "About to print"
 ? int_JobID := CUPS_PrintFile( CUPS_GetDefault(),
"/home/bwana/sixthsense/templates_safety/Consult1.ps", "TestCUPS4H" )
 ? ? "Job ID is:", int_JobID
 ? ?
 ? InKey( 0 )
 ? QUIT

 You need to:

 compile CUPS4HFunctions.c with something like:
 gcc CUPS4HFunctions.c -c -I./../../include -I./../../../harbour/include

 then I created a library from it with something like:
 ? ar rc ./../../lib/libcups4h.a ./CUPS4HFunctions

 then when you link your program (or my test program) you need to include
the following libraries:
 -lcups -lcups4h

 Good luck!? If I can be of further help let me know.

 By the way CUPS_GETDEFAULT() will return the name of the default printer.

 CUPS_PRINTFILE( cPrinterName, cFileToPrint, cNameForPrintQueue ) will
print a file.? I will add support for options some time.

 This code is an experiment I only did last night!

 Regards
 Doug

not start inkey topic
if i type inkey it works

Hi angel
If you share here basic part of your work "get like screen navigable"
maj help go in right direction
I remember a similar argument with eXPress for xbase++ by roger donnay

Hello Everybody

The following code which was working perfect till 15Mar2010 
got weired after 04Apr2010, I have two distros so cannot pinpoint 
exact dates.

CLASS Abc
   DATA  oActiveX

   ACCESS BackColor                 INLINE ::oActiveX:BackColor
   ASSIGN BackColor( nRGB )      INLINE ::oActiveX:BackColor    := nRgb

   ACCESS LabelWidth               INLINE ::oActiveX:Label:Width
   ASSIGN LabelWidth   ( nVal )  INLINE ::oActiveX:Label:Width   := nVal

   ENDCLASS

METHOD Abc:New()

   ::oActiveX := MyActiveX():new(...)

   RETURN Self

FUNCTION Main()
   Local oLbl

   oLbl := Abc():new()
   #if 0                                /*   ORIGINAL CODE   -   Now GPFs  
*/
   oLbl:BackColor := fwn_RGB( 255, 0, 192 )
   #else                               /* WORK OK */
   oLbl:oActiveX:BackColor := fwn_RGB( 255, 0, 192 )  
   #endif
Similarly
   #if 0
   oLbl:LabelWidth   := p_[ LB_LWIDTH   ]                        /* GPFs */
   #else
   oLbl:oActiveX:Label:Width  := p_[ LB_LWIDTH  ]           /* OK */
   #endif 

I have searched ChangeLog but could not find the any entry
which I could corelate with this issue.

Probably, Shum's report about asigning an instance variable of object from 
other  dll  is of this type.

Hi,

Is there any function to parse a utf8 string that detect (and replace) utf8 
errors characters ?
I'm testing with HB_UTF8TOSTR, but this one is codepage dependent.

Best Regards,

I've published all the source code in this very same list.
When I resume my tests, I will publish it again.
Otherwise look on old messages.

This code works.
So the issue is shortlisted to INLINE keyword.

Angel,

ACCESS/ASSIGN keywords in method definition are a xbase++ compatibility issue.

I'll look at it as soon as you create self contain example which
I can compile and test so it should not use MyActiveX() or any other
non Harbour functions.
If you cannot create such example then probably your problems are
caused by memory corruption in MyActiveX() or some other non harbour
code which are exploited as GPF in some cases, i.e. when you make
some modification in your code like above switching between inline
and standard methods. In such case non of us can help.

BTW there were some modifications in OLE code used by GTWVG.
Maybe they are related to your problem.

best regards,
Przemek

You remember well. INLINE is less efficient than creating 
a real method. It saves typing by creating slower code.

    ! Fixed date handling in area putValue method for .dbf tables. 
      ADS does not support dates smaller than 0001-01-01 and stores 
      invalid values in .dbf without any error. F.e., 0000-01-01 is 
      stored as '-0011231', CTOD("")+5 is stored as '****1128'. Such 
      invalid filed values generates ADS runtime error 5095 later on 
      getValue area method.
      DBF RDD stores empty dates in case of unsupported date range.
      This fix makes ADS RDD behaviour more compatible to DBF RDD. 
      ADSADT behaviour is not changed because ADS allows to store 
      and retrieve field values for dates before 0001-01-01.

ADS should support in DBF (at least in VFP mode) julian date fields
as 32bit little endian integer values {"D", 4, 0} which do not use
string representation.
As I can see your modification effected also such fields.
I think that you should change the condition from:

   pArea->iFileType != ADS_ADT

to:
   pField->uiLen == 8

or
   pField->uiLen != 4

(AFAIR uiLen == 3 in ADS DBFs is SIX3 packed date with the same
restrictions as string version)

Przemek

Hi All,

I'm getting this on OS X:

fopen64() seems to be missing on OS X. What is the best way to fix this?

Message-ID: <A0539BF8-D818-4EAB-ACCE-313776A282CC@windtelsoft.com>

Hello Przemek,

When using the debugger and having objects with destructors,
sometimes when the AltD() function is executed and the program
execution is paused the destructor code is not called until the first
InKey( 0 ) call is issued and causing  the execution of the destructor
code right after entering the debugger.

The workaround is to have:

  HB_GCAll() ; AltD()


Can we have HB_GCAll() inside AltD() by default ?


best regards,

Teo

What about to simply use fopen instead of fopen64 ?

I have a patch ready which does that, but 
without seeing the big picture for these 
functions, it will not be the most perfect 
solution I'm afraid. Anyway I will now commit 
it as a darwin patch because this is a showstopper.

Brgds,

Dear friends, I'd just want to know if Harbour supports PING.

Thank you.

You may find this useful:

HB_FUNC( PING )
{
     hb_retl( IsDestinationReachable( hb_parcx( 1 ), NULL ) );
}

In your hbp file:

# IsDestinationReachable
-lsensapi

This API function is not officially supported by Microsoft last time I looked 
(which was quite a while ago).

Hello,

this sample generates an GPF

----------------

struct := {{"campo1","C",65000,0},{"campo2","C",65000,0}}
dbcreate("test1.dbf",struct)

-------------------

It is normal or I'm doing something wrong ?

Take a look there:

It is a simple NETIO applet that i wrote (win platform) utilizing Server 
& client connection(s). Install the prog. (just copy the executable) 
into directory where are your .dbfs and start it in server mode.
Then install in *each* client-machine a copy of the (same) executable, 
enter server's IP and try to connect. It should work..

I've not tested but...
It should give you an RTE and not a GPF.
Char fields have a maximum of 255 chars.

I don't think that it's "too early"... we may work hard for many
months to have stable hbQt.. but if it doesn't interface with the
"clipper" way of doing business applications ?

In my code I have a lot of VALID and WHEN and PICTURE... if we don't
think about a way to emulate such functionalities we may be forced to
rewrite too much code...
For QLineEdit we have :inputMask to act like a PICTURE but with a
slighty different syntax... validators may also help...

For VALIDs... should we connect to returnPressed() ? Or FocusOut ? and
FocusIn for WHENs...


I'd just like to receive this code snipped in a hbqt compatible way...
just to understnad what changes are needed for the followinfg code
snippet....


procedure main()
local age := 0
local surname := space( 20 )
clear screen
@ 2,2 say "Surname: " get surname PICTURE "@!"
@ 4,2 say "Age" get age picture "99" when ! empty( surname ) valid  age > = 18
read
? "Hello " + surname + "! Your are " + alltrim(str( age )) + " years old"

Please enable warnings in CLANG builds.
It's hard to guess what exactly is missing and why and which
builds/platforms/C compilers are affected.
Maybe also GCC binaries are broken but here all warnings in
all /external/* libraries in all GCC based builds are pacified
so only runtime tests can exploit GPF or other problems.

No it should be RTE instead of GPF.
In DBF maximum record size is 64KB and above example needs
130001 bytes for record exceeding this limit.
I'll update DBF RDD to generate RTE in such case.

It will not resolve the problem because commands execute inside
debugger may also activate GC and PRG destructor code compiled
with -b harbour compiler flag.
In general I do not see big problem with current behavior and
your proposition may badly interact with debugging destructor
code though I haven't analyzed it deeply.

The server example code in contrib/hbnetio/utils/netiosrv.prg
accepts many connections. Number of connections is limited only
by system resources.
NETIO_MTSERVER() in HBNETIO library is a function which activates
such server. It has to be linked with MT HVM (-mt hbmk2 switch).

Hi,


thanks for suggestion. The previous code was based on ADS documentation. 
It does not mention that VFP supports D,4 fields.

Do you have compiled in multithread mode ?

I don't have tested yet in multiple connections but If I am not wrong
I read that , it is needed MT mode

This is my server , the defines , are not needed but i use it as a remember

fopen64() is not present on OS X. After above 
warning (which is not pacified), it results in 
link time failure with this symbol missing.

Do you have compiled in multithread mode ?

I don't have tested yet in multiple connections but If I am not wrong
I read that , it is needed MT mode

This is my server , the defines , are not needed but i use it as a remember of defaults for the server

The server example code in contrib/hbnetio/utils/netiosrv.prg
accepts many connections. Number of connections is limited only
by system resources.
NETIO_MTSERVER() in HBNETIO library is a function which activates
such server. It has to be linked with MT HVM (-mt hbmk2 switch).

best regards,
Przemek

I am helpless that I cannot create a self-reduced sample.

What I did, just created the standard methods instead of 
calling INLINE and everything went fine.

I am not sure if changing the method calling convension 
has anything to do with OLE object.

For now my problem is over and in future I will always 
take care that INLINE instance variable access/assign 
should never peep into my programs. Just to remmeber, 
I re-mention that the same code worked absolutely OK 
before 15 Mar and this code has nothing to do with OLE 
changes in GTWVG. I am using my local implementaion 
of ActiveX code because of one nasty active-x ( VisiLabel )
which is not standradized OLE.

There is one pending issue of similar nature which Shum posted 
some days back. If will be kind if you look into that issue.
It pertains to object instance access/assign from within
exe to an object created in a Harbour compiled .dll.

Shum, can you show that code again ?

Hola Ciro. Se que hablas espa?ol y asi te lo explico mejor.
?
Estoy migrando una peque?a aplicacion de Facturacion e Inventarios que tenia en Clipper a harbour, hasta alli todo bien excepto una libreria de terceros y simule con harbour las funciones de estas.
?
Por razones de estabilidad estoy haciendo unos test desde windows-xp contra un servidor ubuntu-linux que es donde estan las tablas dbf. y me encuentro en que solo me permite hacer una coneccion al server, ahora lo que me falta probar es compilar con MT mode.
?
Ahora te agradeceria me hicieras saber algunos tips para trabajar con esta "extraordinaria funcionabilidad de harbour""
?
Saludos

Do you have compiled in multithread mode ?

I don't have tested yet in multiple connections but If I am not wrong
I read that , it is needed MT mode

This is my server , the defines , are not needed but i use it as a remember of defaults for the server

Subject: [Harbour] hbMK2 - File type checking before calling compile/link
	commands
Message-ID: <1271996797527-4948694.post@n2.nabble.com>


Hello Viktor

Today I ran into this issue.

In hbIDE project sources I included .ch, .h files
to have them editable from within project node tree.
All went fine upto the point I did not build the project.
hbMK2 is passing all types of sources without checking
if it is a valid source, i.e., .prg, .c, .cpp, .rc, .res, .o, .obj.

Is it possible ? 
If not, I have to devise a little different interface to 
present these files in the project tree.

Or, if possible it's even better and simpler to just 
remove 'set HB_COMPILER=msvc' and rely on autodetection.

hbmk2 will sort the input files by type 
(looking at the extension), and use them 
accordingly. It's true there is no negative 
filter for headers though, and the reason 
is that also harbour compiler doesn't limit 
the compilable set of extensions this way.
(IOW you can do: 'harbour hello.ch').
It _does_ however recognize objects, 
resources and C/CPP files and handles 
them accordingly, so I believe only 
program headers and other misc extensions 
(like .txt, .ini) can cause you such 
problem for you.

If you need to store such misc files in 
.hbp files without wanting them to be 
processed by hbmk2, just use '-3rd' 
options to store them, f.e.:
  -3rd=hbide_extrafile=my.txt

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Pritpal,

Make sure to rebuild everything in the chain, and 
see if it resolves it.

You can also try to run it under valgrind on Linux.

Probbaly the compiler stopped with .h file.
.ch files might have been taken care of as I did 
not see error coming off them.

True. But then this will involve another

It was compiled and resulted in an empty 
object. This is not foolproof solution though.

It has nothing to anything. It works just like standard methods
though it's a less efficient due to one additional function stack
frame which is created during execution of inline methods so
the memory alignment is a little bit different and it can interact
with some buggy code which access non initialized memory or use
wrong pointers or even keep some indirect references to function
methods in C structures.

The fact that in the past some code was executed without GPF does
not mean that it was ever correct.
In this particular case GTWVG ActiveX code is still not production
ready. As I can some things have been fixed by coping some parts of
contrib/hbwin/axcore.c to contrib/gtwvg/wvgsink.c but still some
other are not resolved, i.e. WVG_AXSETUPCONNECTIONPOINT() allocates
memory for OLE objects and this memory is never released and the
code which should do that is commented, probably due to GPFs.
I do not see any code which increase reference counter before
returning the pointer to PRG code so such GPF is expected behavior
inside WVG_AXSHUTDOWNCONNECTIONPOINT(). And as far as I know this
code existed here for very long time.

Of course it's probably not the reason of your problems but it shows
that this code is not such perfect as you suggested.

I've seen this message and I haven't found anything what suggested
any problems in core code but maybe you see sth what I'm missing
so please be so kind and tell me what I should check or better
please create self contain as small as possible example which we
can compile and test ourselves.

No it should be RTE instead of GPF.
In DBF maximum record size is 64KB and above example needs

It was pacified and still is in GCC builds on all platforms.
Anyhow please check feature set macros in MacOSX and how
to enable 64bit file offset support in standard stdio commands
like fopen(). If only fopen64() was missing and functions like
ftello64() and fseeko64() exists then probably it does not need
fopen64() and your recent modification only disabled long file
support in Darwin MINIZIP builds.
In such case only
   #define fopen64 fopen
should be added for this platform.

This is the main problem of hbqt. If it can't easily migrate existing
C5x UI code like @ say/get read forms and tbrowses it is almost
useless for me. Easily desn't mean 100% compatible but something that
can be done using PP and some modifications.

If not it would be much simpler to use QT in "native way". You'll
easily find skilled C++ developers, support and documentation.

Record size in DBF is limited to 65535 bytes due to DBF structure only.
The size of record is stored in two bytes (16bit) inside DBF header.
In theory we can create incompatible DBF files which will not respect
this limit but probably only Harbour can read them.

Clipper also can create DBF files with record size up to 64KB.
If any memory limitation exists (I haven't exploited them) then
they work just like any other system resource limitations and
interacts also with all other things. The record size is not
an exception here.

grepping for ftello64 and fseeko64 in /usr/include and 
/Developer/usr/include shows no results, so all these 
*64 functions seem to be missing on Darwin.

'man fopen' doesn't reveal anything about 64bit offset 
either.

Sorry I want to say I?m testing with:

hb_strtoutf8(hb_utf8tostr(cString))

that replaces utf8's errors with "?" but is codepage dependent

I just did a rebuild with MSVC2008 and all appears well with my apps (although I 
wish I could find the time to rewrite with unit tests!).

Thanks

This means that a developer needs to change every ROW, COL value to X,
Y and add the WIDTH value. And what about tbrowses, achoices, prompts,
menus?

Not to mention that fixed position is a dead end in 2010:

what happens when the user changes the font size?
what happens when the user moves from a 4/3 video 1024x768 to a 16/9 1440x900?
what happens when the user turns the tablet from landscape to portrait?

best regards,
Lorenzo

  * contrib/hbmysql/readme.txt
    ! More or less updated this text.

      Notice have a common rules to build _all_ contribs
      and _all_ accompanying test/util apps since at least
      6-12 months, so most of it was not needed anymore.

      It'd be interesting to make interviews with those
      users who still cannot figure how to link apps, since
      I'm out of ideas how it can be still blown off, or
      what is the common blocking item in such cases.
      My current guess is that they either don't know hbmk2,
      or they copy it away from its location, or they copy
      away tests from their original location.

      As some rules of thumb / checklist:
        0. download C compiler (mingw/msvc prefereed) (see links in INSTALL)
        1. install C compiler
        2. configure C compiler (as per INSTALL EXAMPLES section)
        3. download dependencies (see links in INSTALL)
        4. install dependencies
        5. setup HB_WITH_* vars (as per INSTALL)
        6. go to Harbour source root dir
        7. build Harbour (as per INSTALL, usually: 'win-make' or 'make' command)
        8. change dir to preferred tests or utils subdir inside
           Harbour source tree ('cd contrib/hbmysql/tests').
        9. issue command: '<path>hbmk2 test.prg'
           (where <path> is the path to hbmk2 executable,
           or nothing, if Harbour bin dir has been added to PATH)
       10. remember to put involved .dll in PATH, or copy them next to
           the executable.

       And again: _delete_ HB_COMPILER envvar.

Hi Przemek

Shouldn't the NETIO server API call make an RTE 
if not called in MT mode?

This is a frequent problem and despite all the 
hbmk2 configurations and information out there, 
lots of users get it wrong, causing such long 
threads.

BTW, this still also applies to all HBNETIO triers:
---
      As some rules of thumb / checklist to build 
      _any_ Harbour contribs and test apps:
        0. download C compiler (mingw/msvc prefereed) (see links in INSTALL)
        1. install C compiler
        2. configure C compiler (as per INSTALL EXAMPLES section)
        3. download dependencies (see links in INSTALL)
        4. install dependencies
        5. setup HB_WITH_* vars (as per INSTALL)
        6. go to Harbour source root dir
        7. build Harbour (as per INSTALL, usually: 'win-make' or 'make' command)
        8. change dir to preferred tests or utils subdir inside
           Harbour source tree ('cd contrib/hbmysql/tests').
        9. issue command: '<path>hbmk2 test.prg'
           (where <path> is the path to hbmk2 executable,
           or nothing, if Harbour bin dir has been added to PATH)
       10. remember to put involved .dll in PATH, or copy them next to
           the executable.

       And again: _delete_ HB_COMPILER envvar.

Personally, I did some tests in the past with hwgui and used the text
based coordinates as multipliers of font height and width...
WIDTH value can be calculated... code can be taken from the GET
system, since it calculates the screen area to use... just multiply by
font width..

PICTURE are a problem since there is non compatibility with Qt... I
don't use complex picture string, just some "@!"...
VALID and WHEN are a completely diffent subject since you have to
create a layer that handles object focus... more, I did not understand
if there is already a system (hbxbp???) to interface memory variables
with "widgets"
Example, setting a variable value inside a widget is "easy"... but
then the widget must set the new value back, possibly in a clipper
compatible way....

Or otherwise we should change programing paradigm, a new style of
programming, at least the screen interface...

> And what about tbrowses, achoices, prompts,
> menus?

Well, if they were incapsulated in your functions, you may try to
adapt them to hbqt...


In the long end, it would be difficult to adapt an old application
without serious changes in the code....

Hola Ciro. Se que hablas espa?ol y asi te lo explico mejor.
?
Estoy migrando una peque?a aplicacion de Facturacion e Inventarios que tenia en Clipper a harbour, hasta alli todo bien excepto una libreria de terceros y simule con harbour las funciones de estas.
?
Por razones de estabilidad estoy haciendo unos test desde windows-xp contra un servidor ubuntu-linux que es donde estan las tablas dbf. y me encuentro en que solo me permite hacer una coneccion al server, ahora lo que me falta probar es compilar con MT mode.
?
Ahora te agradeceria me hicieras saber algunos tips para trabajar con esta "extraordinaria funcionabilidad de harbour""
?
Saludos

Do you have compiled in multithread mode ?

I don't have tested yet in multiple connections but If I am not wrong
I read that , it is needed MT mode

This is my server , the defines , are not needed but i use it as a remember of defaults for the server

The server example code in contrib/hbnetio/utils/netiosrv.prg
accepts many connections. Number of connections is limited only
by system resources.
NETIO_MTSERVER() in HBNETIO library is a function which activates
such server. It has to be linked with MT HVM (-mt hbmk2 switch).

Przemek

File extensions means nothing in Linux.
Probably you'll have to create your own shell script to change 
permisions and load then in the appropiate program.

this is not really , linux have the same asociation as windows

if you are using a file explorer you can open a file directly without
especify the program
if extension is asociated to determinate program installed in your linux box

What linux your are using angel ?

And if is not asociated , you can open manually and set to remember

xdg-open should works for every freedesktop complaint desktop.

I use sth like:
...
cStrCmd := "xdg-open " + cFile
...
HB_RUN( cStrCmd + "&" )

Hi,

Pls try solution below.

1. Create new directory inside Harbour source tree: /examples/hbps32
2. Copy tpscript.prg and pscript.ch to the new dir.
3. Edit tpscript.prg and replace '__XHARBOUR__' with '__HARBOUR__'.
4. Create these two files in the new dir:
--- hbps32.hbc
incpaths=.
libpaths=lib/${hb_plat}/${hb_comp}

libs=hbps32

..\contrib\hbxpp\hbxpp.hbc
---

--- hbps32.hbp
-hblib
-olib/${hb_plat}/${hb_comp}/hbps32
-inc

tpscript.prg
---

5. Build hbps32 lib:
     hbmk2 hbps32.hbp
6. Try it with test program (I don't have any):
     hbmk2 test.prg hbps32.hbc

Tell us about the results.

[ dllcall.c is not need for Harbour, and we have 
these features implemented in hbxpp lib. Notice, 
you'll need current Harbour for the above, for 
2.0 it needs changes. ]

This very well illustrates the problem.
Soo it means somewhere, may be at deep levels, 
ACCESS/ASSIGN ... INLINE ...
has some differences with regular method calls.

I am just asking, which ChangeLog entry after 15 Mar 
highlighted this difference. It is only for informative purposes.

Based on this alone, I am about to remove a lot of INLINE calls 
from hbXBP.

True. But my code was not buggy at all. 
It just worked as I explained and all of a sudden it stopped working
without even changing a line in the code. I am simply trying to 
figure out 'what caused it'.

I already told, I have removed all calls to inline access/assign and
everything is working fine without changing anything in other C code.

I will turn to this code soon.
Probably I will remove GTWVG implementation of activeX code and will 
resort to HBWIN one.

I do not know if you ever tried hbIDE and hbXBP+hbQT.
If you can, then I will send a ready to compile .hbp projects.

Yes, but your project files do not allow to compile them in 
a standard way. This I had pointed you in one of my messages.
Anyway, for this show I have the .hbp(s) ready to be build in 
contrib/hbide/projects/shum folder.

I am awaiting Przemeks response, and will post here accordingly.

While dropping INLINE is good idea for performance, it's 
very wrong idea to fix GPF by changing the code.... I can't 
repeat that enough, but seemingly without any reception on 
the other end :( I can't reckon why you find it a good 
idea to fix GPF by introducing kludges on the .prg level...

Which proves nothing.

If your code can build on Linux, just run 
valgrind on it and post the results. You can find the 
exact details in INSTALL about using valgrind.

Hi Bruno:

Linux does not have associations
Desktops have !
So the answer depends on with Desktop (gnome, kde, xfce, lxde, etc) are 
you using.
Let say differently: In linux there isn't an universal way of achieveing 
that !
But maybe a more intensive linux user can show me I'm wrong (I'd love that)

This is the main problem of 
every GUI library. We tend to forget the basic differences of 
CONSOLE and GUI way of programming flow - program controlled vs
user controlled. We can mimic the CUI calls to present the interface
but we _cannot_ mimic the CUI like behavior, viz., ReadModal().

The reason is that GUI behavior is encapsulated in a global "inkey()"
like loop and every object in the application has its own events 
fire/act behavior.

Here we again miss the point.
1. You need to be skilled in C++ which many of us are not.
2. How to hook all the powerful RDD engine.
3. The ease of use.

Yes, hbXBP binds memory variables to widgets.
Check contrib/hbxbp/tests/demoxbp.prg. It illustrates this issue.

No need to reinvent the wheel.
hbXBP is/should be 100% Xbase++ compatible class framework and 
demonstrates that a simple Xbase++ program can be compiled as is.
The need is to work on this library with some existing application 
( which I think, Angel or Shum can provide us ) as a base application
and fill-in the missing links.

TBrowse: I think I can simulate exact TBrowse class in hbXBP. 
XbpBrowse() is already working.

AChoice: should not be a problem but exact same behavior is 
difficult to attain if it is supposed to be called in a modal way.

Menus: are entirely a different beast in GUI world and has to be 
implemented like this only. I did it for Xbase++ around the year 2002
without problems and with not much changes in the existing Clipper code.

And here the similarity ends.
hbQT is not aimed at to be adopted to current Clipper code.
If at any point, someone wants it, then GTQTC library is the answer, 
though it may need some more tweaks.

Tell me why my application running absolutely fine with 
BCC, MSVC till 15 Mar 2010 stopped on one feature after that.
Without changing anything in other code ?  How do you attribute 
as buggy code. Simply changing from INLINE to SETGET method 
fixed the issue. I am still at a loss what should I look into 
in such case. I am conversant with CLASSES and its internal.

Again, I am not trying to prove anything. 
Just trying to explore what is buggy in my code so that I 
do fix it in a proper manner.

Unfortunately not. It is first OLE, second based 
entirely on GTWVG which are Windows only applications.

Leave this discussion, I just showed what I faced and 
how I resolved.

If somebody look's for a more clipper way

this is the idea of HBQtcommand , which is using a sintax like minigui

no full compatible directly , to increase power using some HBQT goodies

but exist an include to translate minigui code to hbqtcommand.

It is in alpha stage but the concept is interesting

I agree, but only if the coordinates are referred to the current form, and
not to the absolute screen as i think Lorenzo was meaning.
So, a great effort is needed to describe the widgets in form (and not
screen) based coordinates, as you know i'm doing yet in Clipper apps.

I think that hwGUI, hbXBP and other similar libraries
Clipper/xBase/(x)Harbour based are more comfortable than the way hbQt could
be linked to getsys construct, so a old Clipper application could be
migrated with minimal or reasonable effort.

A long and winding road... Just you sent me an article about the risk of
software rewriting from scratch...

> > And what about tbrowses, achoices, prompts,
> > menus?

Another problem of QT is the SQL based approach of the browse/grid
component.
If you plain to retain the dbf paradigm i don't see any simple way to employ
the Qt widgets for this objects.

> In the long end, it would be difficult to adapt an old application

Well. If you mean to port an application from Clipper style to pure GUI
style, i agree. The project hitself could become very different if you take
full advantage of the graphics widgets and the UI approach can't be locked
to the poor CUI interface.
Anyway, if your target is to have the old Clipper application to run in a
32/64bit environment and in an acceptable graphic interface, the hwGUI & C.
approach, IMHO, could be a very fast and non expensive path.
Better would be to have an "official Harbour GUI", but this wish is very far
from the target of Harbour developers, as stated in a quite old thread...
So, hbQT will be the better choice to start a new project from scratch, but
for me (and, I suspect, for us) at this time isn't very useful as i need to
port old Clipper applications without loosing the logic and the affordabilty
of the previous code.
Best regards.

If you notice such problem, you need to provide an 
example or test it yourself. There is just little 
point in guessing around.

F.e. I had a GPFs in perfectly valid Harbour code 
(HB_RUN(), WAPI_SHELLEXECUTE(), HB_GTI_CLIPBOARD*) 
the other week and instead of bringing it here to 
the list without any pointers (like test code), 
I made my local research and finally fixed it by 
freshly rebuilding all components, which in the 
case of this release I forgot.

I'm not saying this will fix your case, but before 
trying to raise GPFs here, it's good to sort out 
all possibilities locally (I know it's painful).

It's warning sign if you find GPF is plain obvious 
places like INLINE (or HB_RUN()), that the problem 
is likely not in Harbour, otherwise someone would 
have stumbled upon it, especially since March 15.

Przemek pointed to some problem points inside GTWVG 
code. I also touched this code lately to fix remaining 
OLE problems, so you may review/test them.

BTW you can pretty easily sort out GTWVG if you 
restore pre-March 15 version and retest your app.

This is what I could not do. 
The OLE code touches a licensed component 
and to provide such code I had to provide the component too.


F.e. I had a GPFs in perfectly valid Harbour code 
(HB_RUN(), WAPI_SHELLEXECUTE(), HB_GTI_CLIPBOARD*)

Believe me, it took me full 2 days to figureout 
what exactly went wrong and what is working solution.

Just tell me, if in a class I change these lines:

CLASS ActivLabel
   ACCESS backColor             INLINE ::oActiveX:backColor
   ASSIGN backColor( nRGB )  INLINE ::oActiveX:backColor := nRGB
   ENDCLASS

To 

CLASS ActivLabel
   METHOD backColor( nRGB )  SETGET
   ENDCLASS

METHOD ActivLabel:backColor( nRGB )
   if hb_isNumeric( nRGB )
      ::oActiveX:backColor := nRGB
   endif 
   RETURN ::oActiveX:backColor


What should I look into my code and in what way.

places like INLINE (or HB_RUN()), that the problem 
is likely not in Harbour, otherwise someone would

I do not say there is a problem in Harbour.
May be this is an issue with how an OLE object 
contained in an instance variable of a class is treated.
It is a specialized behavior and may be reproducable 
in an ordinary instance.

May be this can help to understand from other angle:
In Shum's example:
If an instance variable is containing another object and is 
created in a .dll, the main .exe code cannot set its properties.
This is not an exact problem what I faced, but may lead to 
resolution.

It is not a problem of GTWVG at all. My applications are 
running fine with latest SVN. The only problem I faced is with 
above like code and these were reported by my clients after I 
posted Vouch compiled with Apr 04 Harbour.

It is true I should have checked it with some Harbour after 
Mar15, but because of so much of development processes, 
I cannot do so.

Anything which may corrupt memory.

[ my gut feeling tells this is a different 
problem than Shum's. ]

I wonder how can you be sure. I such memory 
corruption case, all code can causing the error.
So what you can do is swap them component by 
component to known working version to sort it 
out as a possibility. GTWVG is suspicious for 
already discussed reasons, and I'm also positive 
that Przemek pointed to real problems.

Hi,

With 'current SVN' I referred to latest source code repository.

2.0.0 is the latest stable release. Current SVN is at 2.1.0beta1, 
it's also considered stable, and it has dll.ch.

Any. Any entry can change code size, this affect memory allocation, 
addresses of functions, and makes bug be visible or hidden.

It's good practice to save one more Harbour VM stack frame, but it has 
nothing to GPF.

So, you've just hidden the bug instead of trying to find it. One more 
time bomb.
Try to not forget about this change. It is possible that after two years 
you'll be able to "solve" one more (actually the same) GPF problem by 
reintroducing INLINE methods :)

Yes, to the best of my knowledge.
And if you count on me, I will surely provide whatever I could on hbXBP
front.
I have made some fixes and more functionality in hbXBP and is scheduled 
to be committed tomorrow.

The only problem till date is nobody has invested time 
on writing a small application and then consistently pushing my 
attention towards incompatibilities to be covered.
As I am a fan of Xbase++ class framework, but am not a 
actual user, so all my own efforts are not enough.
Angel started but may be time constraints, he is not regular 
on the subject, and you know, one looses zest when functional 
results are not achieved.

I've installed gource and currently converting Harbour SVN 
repository to Git to be able to use it. Works great with 
another smaller Git repo I had (for GIT itself). And the 
thing is interactive.

BTW Git looks quite nice by now, so maybe it would be 
good to consider it as primary repository for Harbour.

Much easier to play with commits, easier to merge and to 
keep experimental branches (even locally). It's also 
capable of keeping active (and committable!) links to 
foreign repositories. It's also very small and "sandbox" 
contains full history so it's possible to work offline. 
So far I miss the nice revision # SVN has. Some of these 
are not new for devs already using Mercurial f.e. Oh, 
there is also Trac for Git now. Also Tortoise for Git, 
for those who prefer a GUI.

After watching Linus talk about it here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8 , and discuss his opinions of CVS
/ SVN, and having used git few months and trying out its features
extensively, I have really come to appreciate and love it.  I was wondering
if Harbour would ever switch to git.

Subject: [Harbour] Print for COM9 in pocketPC
Message-ID: <28348373.post@talk.nabble.com>


Problem for printer, from pocket pc via bluetooth, i found the next solution,
but i got one error of compilation, the code is:

*cText=file to print

static FUNCTION SendText( cText )

LOCAL i, hOut := CreateFile( "COM1:",GENERIC_WRITE, 0, 0, OPEN_EXISTING,
FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL )
IF hOut==-1
Mensaje("can not open port of printer")
ELSE
FOR i = 1 TO Len( cText )
WriteByte( hOut, Asc( SubStr( cText, i, 1 ) ) )
NEXT
CloseHandle( hOut )
ENDIF
RETURN NIL

this is the error, when compile
lecturas.o:lecturas.c:(.data+0x66c): undefined reference to
`HB_FUN_CREATEFILE'
lecturas.o:lecturas.c:(.data+0x67c): undefined reference to
`HB_FUN_WRITEBYTE'
lecturas.o:lecturas.c:(.data+0x6ac): undefined reference to
`HB_FUN_CLOSEHANDLE'

Thank you

How can print for COM9
Too try with COM_OPEN, COM_SEND and nothing

PD: CreateFile is native of harbour o not.

Here I disagree.

I have a Fivewin version of my apps since 1998 and I'm still selling
it. It has been relatively easy to reach the point where menus, forms
and tbrowses are "shared" between the CUI and GUI. Clearly it required
some classes, some PP and also some changes in the FW classes code but
since FW has SAY/GET and TCBROWSE classes it was not so hard.

Result: I can build the same app as CUI or GUI simply defining a
__DOS__ or a __WIN__ macro at build time.

The main point is that FiveWin was "planned" as a convertion tool for
C5x code while hbqt is a direct wrapper of C++ classes.

IMHO hbqt needs a "compatibility layer" towards C5x UI components (
and it can't be XBP for the reasons I already explained many times
before ).

Lorenzo

Message-ID: <4BD29066.10100@strapper.net>

G'day everyone

I've downloaded HBIde and managed to set it up to use the MinGW compiler 
under HMG. Now I'm trying to build a test prg and am getting error 
messages I don't understand.

The problems:
1. the compiler doesn't know what to do with "-width=512" and I don't 
know where that parameter gets specified.
2. the compiler doesn't know what to do with all the "-3rd=" parameters 
which I've found embedded in C:\hbide\projects\cargilltest.hbp

The transcript is below.

Kind regards,
Bruce M. Axtens

You are using older Harbour and newer hbIDE.
Build Harbour from current SVN. Any previous distro 
available does not contain latest changes in hbMK2.

OR

Just get latest hbMK2.exe from someone and place it 
in Harbour bin folder. And you are done.

It is not its job !
hbqt maps the Qt classes, and it's something we must have. Also
hwgui/minigui  have such classes but in hwgui case (I didn't study
minigui code) they are a mess, since a class maps a windows objects
WITH clipper behaviour....  hbqt is better on this front, since a
QLineEdit works like a documented QLineEdit widget. And then you can
have hbxbp on top, that encapsulates QLineEdit in a xbpSLE, a bit
misleading name, but with written documentation and some sample code.


We can think about a "compatibility layer" and base it on hbxbp or
directly on hbqt...

Me too, . But for example in CUI applications with no mouse enabled
you were forced to enter all the on-screen fields (*) so that you
could use VALID/WHEN for side-effects jobs like moving record
pointers, setting variables, etc. With the mouse, you can jump from
field to field... in windows users expect that disabled fields are
grayed (WHEN condition= false) and not just skipped so that you should
evalutate the conditions not just when entering the field (but it can
have side-effects...)

Is your code using @ GET, or is data-driven based ? In the first case
the only way to go  is with PP (like Massimo has shown) and some glue
classes, in the second case it can be easier (can be, Maurizio warned
about possible coordinates problems)
It would be nice to see two screenshot of the same form of your
application, one from CUI and the other from fivewin...

We can think about a "compatibility layer" and base it on hbxbp or
directly on hbqt...

I don't think it would be a hard job... hwgui already has such layer...

I spoke too soon.

I now have HBIde referring to the MinGW and the HARBOUR underneath 
HMG.3.0.30

The HBMK2.EXE under HMG is the same (I checked; it's byte or byte the 
same) as that in HB20 so by "newer" it would seem that there's a yet 
newer Harbour out there, other than what is touted on the 
Harbour-Project.org website.

As you can see below "-width" is still the issue and that is asserted by 
line 1185 in ideprojmanager.prg
     aadd( aHbp, "-width=512"  )

Granted I could comment that line out and rebuild HBIde. Or else there's 
another solution.

Kind regards,
Bruce.

Hi Pritpal and Francesco,
as an old ( and not happy ) user of xBase++, I'm very interested to try the
xBase parts in starting the second step of my migration path.
I successfully migrated four consistent and working production applications
in Harbour, using Wvt as GT, and easily I'll make same work for a lot of
other applications running currently in Clipper 5.2e.
Now, i need to change from CUI to GUI and, before to reapply my work and
knolewdges in hwGUI, I'll try to use hbxbp for UI.
I found, many years ago, very friendly the way how xBase Parts can integrate
itself in a little modified version of getsys and my xBase port UI was very
good. I abandoned xBase++ because I never obtained a fast and affordable
database ( some critical error was inacceptable for production use ). 
If the compatibility with xBase Parts is full, I'll reuse the framework (
very similar to the layer used for hwGUI integration ) and i'll evaluate
what library will be eligible for GUI migration.
So, I ask you, Pritpal and Francesco, if you are interested to test this
path. I can share my getsys layer ( Francesco yet knows how is built ) and
we can use my working applications as effective test of migration.
Question: hbxbp isn't a GT, so I figure that not will be possible to migrate
incrementally the UI objects linking gtWvt+hbxbp... It's true?
I'm waiting for you thought about.
Best regards.

Maurizio la Cecilia

You are right, but wront too.
The version posted as a VERSION is exactly what you see
and are using. But development is continously progressing.
So that's why I asked download SVN. It is not a published 
version but the current snapshot of code developed after 
that version.

Hope it will be more accurate reply.

Do you downloaded Harbour from SVN? For now 2.1.0.beta1 is available only
from SVN. You need download and build it. If you can't download and build
from SVN I think you should wait official 2.1.0 come, I am pretty right
someone will build and publish it on Sourceforge.

I'm part of this people.
hbQt could be the best choice due to his multiplatform, rich and well
documented implementation, but the approach is very critical whan applied to
existing Clipper code.

You are right.
I agree with the "compatibility layer" as I used something similar to wrap
hwGUI objects to my Clipper framework and worked fine.
But I ask you for a reference to the thread about the XBP inconsistency in
this approach, or a summary of your thought about.
I'm very interested in use xBase Parts and, because I yet made a
compatibility layer for xBase++, I would know what part of the layer could
be critical in this approach whit Harbour.
TIA.

Hi

For me the intent is follow Francesco's original thoughts and create
my application based on Qt style and dropping any old style. However typical
xBase programmer would have a lot difficulties to learn and use this
new approach so a compatibility layer is necessary. IMHO this is all or
nothing, or the programmer uses Qt style directly from HBQt (since it
mirrors Qt) or he uses a 100% backward compatibility layer. Of course new
features can added, forward compatibility is not needed.

A layer where compatibility is dropped and new features are capped by design
of API should not be priority.

Just my opinion.

I think better to go step by step.
Only if we can obtain a working xbp layer, we'll can build a hbqt layer on
it.
The direct hbqt approach is very hard for me and could result in a no way
direction.
I'm ever targetting to port old Clipper code.
Maybe if you unlink this need (as hbIDE project), starting from scratch
could be useful in hbqt direct approach.

A layer taking count, in a little modifed getsys (mainly reader), could take
in charge the event polling.
You know how this was made in hwGUI approach and how this way we mimic the
readmodal using graphic controls.

I vote again for test before the hbxbp layer.
I'm architect. Never build the upper floors on a unsure foundation.
About the direct path i'm very dubious.

Hi Byron,

You're trying to call Windows API functions from .prg 
code directly. Such functions don't exist in Harbour 
on the .prg level.

You either need to create wrappers for them, or even 
better try to use the COM functions in hbwin lib:
   WIN_COMOPEN(), WIN_COMWRITE(), WIN_COMCLOSE().

(see examples in tests subdir in hbwin)

Hi Pritpal,

It seems you rather created a new problem for *nix 
users. As a rule: never transform casing of paths 
and filenames in portable code, and use hb_FileMatch() 
to check for equality of filenames and paths. This 
will do case sensitive comparison on *nixes and case 
insensitive ones on win/dos/os2.

I could not get the whole concept.
I am storing the filename as is selected. Before, I was 
lower-casing them. So the situation is exactly the same
in both cases. I never used hb_FileMatch(), can you 
fix this code to allow projects to be portable on 
any platforms and at the same time sources be 
located accordingly ?

I'd feel it better if you'd understand the concept 
and keep it fixed in the future. F.e. if you look 
for a file names "Hello.prg" on Linux, it's not 
good to use 'LOWER( "Hello.prg" ) == fn' when looking 
it up in a list of filenames, as there might also exist 
a "hello.prg" which is a different file. So it's 
better to use hb_FileMatch( "Hello.prg", fn ) instead.
The only place where you want to keep using LOWER(), 
is when looking for file types:
   LOWER( ExtOf( "Hello.PRG" ) ) == ".prg"

Here is your patch:
---
-   cLPath := hbide_pathNormalized( cPath, .t. )
-   IF left( cLPath, len( cLRoot ) ) == cLRoot
+   cLPath := hbide_pathNormalized( cPath, .f. )
+   IF left( lower( cLPath ), len( cLRoot ) ) == cLRoot
---

You've added a LOWER() call to a comparison, which 
won't remove any code which converts filenames to 
lowercase, and as I understand this was the problem 
of original poster ("For example file name is Main.prg but
in project list is main.prg").

I hope that help, or others can jump in.

Because the bugs was not exploited so far.
A classic example of long term problems which used to appear
when the code is not written to be safe in all possible cases
and generate RTE in some abnormal conditions but never GPF.
If code is not written in such way then you have to accept that
changing a color of some text printed in completely different
part of application may cause global crash because it may change
the contents of some memory used without valid intialization or
type checking in other code.
You can thing about non direct inline method calling just like
about above color changing which may but does not have cause
application crash due to exploiting some hidden so far problems.

Please make some test using GTWVG code from the beginning of march.
It may give you some answers.

If your code needs MS-Windows than I suggest to try CodeGuard in BCC
builds. It can give similar to Valgrind reports though it's not general
CPU with OS API emulator but rather compiled code extension. It needs
special C compile time switches to enable some additional protection/
statistic code and link with special runtime library. You should
recompile Harbour core code with it and then your code. See INSTALL
for info about this BCC CodeGuard switches.

Only one function needs MT in NETIO server part.
It's NETIO_MTSERVER(). All other code perfectly well works in single
thread mode and are fully usable. I.e. someone can prefer single
thread server only for some dedicated connection or using HB_FORK()
and do not want to use MT HVM.
The example of HBNETIO server uses:
   REQUEST HB_MT
so it cannot be linked with non MT HVM version due to link time error.
So we can talk noly about NETIO_MTSERVER() function.
Now this function return <pListenSocket> or NIL on any errors (i.e.
the IP port is already in used or code was linked with non MT HVM
so user should always check the return value.
If you think that it may help users then such RTE can be added only
to this function as:

   ELSE
      [...] // gen RTE

in the 'IF hb_mtvm()' statement in netiomt.prg but other code should
not force in any way MT mode.

Subject: [Harbour] Problem compiling with HBIde (newbie)
Message-ID: <4BD2FF5C.6080903@gmail.com>

G'day everyone

Having downloaded and installed the nightly build, I'm having issues 
with HBIde again. In the output below, this appears to be the offending 
text:

hbmk2: Error: Running Harbour compiler (embedded). 1

(c:\hmg.3.0.30\harbour\bin\harbour.exe) -n2 
C:/hbide/projects/cargilltest/test.prg -g3 -w3 -q -oc:\TEMP\ 
-ic:/hmg.3.0.30/harbour/include


Now when I did my 'make install', it was with
     SET HB_COMPILER=mingw
     SET HB_GT_LIB=gtwin
     SET HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\hmg.3.0.30\HARBOUR
     SET HB_PLATFORM=win
And it all seemed to work okay for installation. However its the using 
it that's problematic now. Where did I go wrong this time?

Kind regards,
Bruce.

And the other interesting thing is that it all works okay from the 
command line:

I usually receive in my logs:

(C:\harbour_dev\harbour\mingw\bin\harbour.exe) -n2
C:/harbour/contrib/hbide/projects/amigow/appLogin.prg -D__HBIDE_DEBUG_ -w3
-es2 -gc3 -q -oC:\harbour\contrib\hbide\projects\amigow\.hbmk\win\mingw\
-iC:/harbour_dev/harbour/mingw/include -ic:/harbour/contrib/hbxbp
-ic:/harbour/contrib/hbqt

and in your log:

C:/hbide/projects/cargilltest/test.prg -g3 -w3 -q -oc:\TEMP\ 

has -g3 switch, which should be -gc3, probably.
Can you modify your project file .hbp from -g3 to -gc3 ?

This is a .ppo compile.
Plese try with regular build, not .ppo.
Only then we will be able to compare Harbour options.

Your project file does not contain libpath entry pointing to libps32.a.
Include in your .hbc 
-LD:\hb20\examples\ps32\lib\win\mingw

Hi,

You moved hbps32.hbc from its original location, 
which broke it. The solution is to leave it in 
its original place and refer to the .hbc file 
with path: hbmk2 mytest.prg examples/ps32/ps32.hbc.

Or copy mytest.prg to examples/ps32/tests/ 
and just use: hbmk2 mytest.prg

Another problem: Pls delete hbps32.* files, 
I originally posted on the list, and use only 
the ones from SVN. You currently have a mixture 
of them which will not work.

After replacing HBXBP and HBQT references with some other OOP code
all works without any problems so I can confirm that the problem is
inside HBXBP and/or HBQT.

It depends on what you want to do with it.
It gives two things.
Dedicated for RDD file server and here are similar conditions to
file server computers.
Probably the most important is system performance and as servers
Linux seems to be much better choice.
The second thing realized by HBNETIO is RPC support so you can
move some parts of your application to the server side. Here you
have to decide yourself what is necessary to execute your code
on the server side by many different client.

When I'll find some spare time then I'll also add to HBNETIO
support for server communication channels what should nicely
extend HBNETIO functionality, i.e. HBNETIO server can be used
on client side to give direct access to local devices/resources
controlled by server side application and also to send simultaneously
asynchronous events like incoming data on COM ports when they appear
without explicit requests from the application. This should help users
to move most of the application to the server side and make this part
event driven. This will be the 3-rd HBNETIO job.
I already implemented this extension for my own use but it's not
ready to commit to SVN because I have to clean yet its public API.
I think I'll do that in next month.

Thank you for your efforts.

Please re-review my point:

tgui.prg is compiled to a .dll
tst.prg contains main() and is linked with tgui.dll

When application is linked like above, GPF occurs.
But if application is linked normally with tst.prg and tgui.prg without the
latter as dll,
application runs absolutely fine, no GPFs.

How this behavior is responsible for a problem in HBXBP and/or HBQT ?
I really cannot reach to a convincing point here.

This will be an excellent addition to hbNETIO and probably most 
of the code can, then, be transferred on server side. Though it 
will not be a replacement for much awaited GTNET, but still will allow 
the developers to think differently about their future strategies.

Thank you for all your visions.

Further analysis is suggesting me, I may be wrong, that 
in -shared mode application calling one of its dlls which in turn 
is calling hbQT and hbXBP which I believe is not linked as shared.
And this may be responsible that 

::oWidget := QMainWindow():configure( QT_HBQMainWindow( {|n,p| ::grabEvent(
n,p ) }, hb_threadId() ) )

is failing. I can see that ::oWidget:pPtr appears to be an invalid pointer.

May be this can shed a light on this issue.

I also confirm that problem is hbXBP and/or hbQT
but cannot find-out why it is so if object is created in a code 
residing in a .dll.

Here are results of 10 runs of tst.exe with tgui.dll and without it 

Without DLL  :  ::oWidget:pPtr ( QMainWindow()... ) ==  0x010976CC ( always
same )
With     DLL   :  ::oWidget:pPtr ( QMainWindow()... ) ==  0x0106CD06 (
always same )

May be it shed some light.

In continuation of above observation,
I am feeling that Qt has some affinity with instance of the 
calling application, which, if it is called from a .dll, has 
dll's instance instead of application instance.

I may be wrong totally.

No, it is not hbXBP and/or hbQT problem.

The problem lies in when GC pointer is retrieved.


Code in tgui.prg compiled as .dll
=======================

Function TestGPF()
   
   Local oWnd
   
   oWnd := QMainWindow():new()
   oWnd:setWindowTitle( "Window" )
   oWnd:show()

   Return Nil

Call in tst.prg linked as .exe
=====================

Function Main()
   
   TestGPF()

   Return Nil


The above code is enough to demonstrate.

The analysis
=========

oWnd:setWindowTitle( "Window" ) calls QWidget.cpp's 

HB_FUNC( QT_QWIDGET_SETWINDOWTITLE )
{
   QWidget * p = hbqt_par_QWidget( 1 );
   if( p )
   {
      ( p )->setWindowTitle( QWidget::tr( hb_parc( 2 ) ) );
   }
}


QWidget * p = hbqt_par_QWidget( 1 ); maps to hbqt_gcpointer( iParam )


void * hbqt_gcpointer( int iParam )
{
   QGC_POINTER * p;

   HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ( "hbqt_gcpointer( %d )", iParam ) );

   p = ( QGC_POINTER * ) hb_parptrGC( hbqt_gcFuncs(), iParam );

   if( p && p->ph )
      return p->ph;
   else if( HB_ISPOINTER( iParam ) )
   {
      HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ( "hbqt_gcpointer(): returns raw pointer: %p",
hb_parptr( iParam ) ) );
      return hb_parptr( iParam ); 
   }
   else
   {
      HB_TRACE( HB_TR_DEBUG, ( "hbqt_gcpointer(): returns NULL" ) );
      return NULL; /* TODO: Still better if RTE. */
   }
}


Here I am returned 

   else if( HB_ISPOINTER( iParam ) )
   {
      HB_TRACE( HB_TR_ALWAYS, ( "hbqt_gcpointer(): returns raw pointer: %p",
hb_parptr( iParam ) ) );
      return hb_parptr( iParam ); 
   }

which should not be as the pointer is created with new() and is a valid GC
collectible pointer.


In composite linked application without .dll part I am returned 
   if( p && p->ph )
      return p->ph;

which is correct and so no GPF.


Hope it helps.

Message-ID: <z2h197623bd1004241833q6e9c6da1mb83bbd7415150040@mail.gmail.com>

Hello harbour developers,

I've developed a webserver (with cookies, https etc) with freepascal
and i want to help creating an harbour server pages module for it.

If interest arise i can add chroot functionalty to the server (The
major lacking functionality).

My idea is to allow usage of harbour in server pages, alike PHP.

I need help from harbour developers to help me integrate harbour to my
server : http://powtils.googlecode.com/svn/dev/tools/lightwebserver/

if interest arise i can rewrite it to be completely harbour oriented
(IE, serving static content + harbour pages).

I think that developing pure clipper solutions (including web
development) is an old desire of the comunity and i think i can help a
lot with this project.

thank you in advance, J. Aldo.

welcome j.aldo (and wellcome? also for your idea)
PHP is server-side?web development?where PHP generally runs on a?web

A simple "hello world" compiles to 1124877 bytes. How come it's so big? 
And is UPX the only way of making it smaller?

Kind regards,
Bruce.

Because it contains whole of run-time and other libs.
Some size can be reduced with some other switches but 
am not sure what those could be.

UPX is what we suggest to pack it.

BTW show your log so that group knows which switches are 
used for linking Hello World application.

Try :

i once tried to develop the webserver using harbour.

its not the right choice. it MUST be some compiled language (C, C++ or Pascal).

its much more stable this way.

I have the webserver WORKING (its not a promise, it IS working right now).

All i want is to be able to load hbrun from some kind of library and
execute the scripts.

Can anyone help me there ?

Use strip tool, or -strip hbmk2 option.

You can also enhance compression using '-9 --lzma' upx options.

It's different thing. Rather, use HB_CDPSELECT().

i just need info on how to embed hbrun into my freepascal code (well,
show me how to do this with C and i can translate to pascal if
needed).

i need :

1 - Harbour being capable of parsing files with <% and %> tags
2 - A way to pass data from my server to harbour and vice versa
3 - A standard way to represent this data in harbour code (like the
PHP[] hash table php uses).
4 - Some harbour code to interpret post data. (I can pass a memory
block containing raw post data).
5 - A way to embed harbour virtual machine (hbrun) into my server (and
a fast way, if i run hbrun.exe - or the platform equivalent - for each
request, i will gain nothing in speed compared to CGI).

My server can pass all http headers to harbour code, if needed.

Currently my server does : HTTP(S), Cookies, Get/Post, CGI and some more.

IT IS NOT DONE IN HARBOUR, its done with compiled language equivalent
in power to C/C++ and can interface with C code directly without
further programming (Harbour is done in C, right ?).

And how do you think this code in HBXBP will be implemented ?



oHtm := XbpHTMLViewer():new( oFrm, , {10,10}, {sz_[1]-10-10,sz_[2]-10-10} )
   oHtm:create()
   oHtm:navigate( "http://www.harbour-project.org" )
   oHtm:titleChange := {|e| UNU( e ) }


In XBP sample this part not work

It is evident why

I think you did not grabbed what Viktor said:

>Yes, it was deleted. 

QWebKit is currently not implemented and will stay as is 
until this component is made available to all platforms Qt supports.

Hope it will be clear to you now.

BTW the above code was a working code.

G'day everyone

I'm not sure where to find this is the documentation, so please bear 
with me.

Does Harbour's coverage of Win32 extend back to Win98?

Kind regards,

Jorge,

if you can add to your server the LRWP protocol of the old xitami web server
you can have what you need and it will be very fast too.

I'm right now using a cgi-bin program written in harbour which interprets .prg
code to produce .html pages, after first invocation the interpreter (called
hscript) connects back to the server via LRWP and registers itself for the
page it was first called for.

>From there on every other call to that page goes from the webserver to hscript
via LRWP protocol until hscript finds it has been idle for some time and it
shuts down making the entire process repeat when that page will be called
again in the future.

I try to better explain:

- http request reaches web server
- web server sees it is for a page with .prg in its name
- web server calls cgi-bin/hscript url
- hscript creates the page as a normal cgi-bin program
- before ending hscript starts itself as an LRWP client
- web server returns .html page
- web server accepts hscript as handler for that page
- new requests go to the hscript client via LRWP

This way every instance of hscript is a separate process (if it has problems
it does not create problems to the web server) and after first call, all other
calls to the same page are really very fast (think about it, all .dbf are
already open, for example).

If you want I can send you the LRWP protocol specifications, they're public,
it is a very simple protocol, should require you more or less a day to fully
implement and test it.

Best regards.

Maurilio.

This is a kind of FCGI, not what i am looking for...

And Xitami is windows only, my server can run on any FreePascal
supported platform :

Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, AmigaOS, BeOS, AtariOS, whatever...

I just want to embed harbour (hbrun) on my server to be able to serve
harbour pages.

I am not asking much, hbrun is already made, my server is already made.

I just need glue logic... I will release the result as opensource, to
allow other people to use it too...

Xitami was multiplatform as well and the LRWP protocol is platform neutral.

Ok, I did not clearly understand this, sorry.

  * harbour/src/common/hbtrace.c
    ! fixed potential GPF/memory corruption due to direct passing formatted
      string as format to syslog() function. Please remember to never create
      code like 'printf( str );' if str can contain printf escape characters
      because it may cause any unpredictable results. Always use
      'printf( "%s", str);' in such context.
      BTW It's one of the most common bug used by hackers in buffer/stack
      overflow attacks, i.e. using str with %n conversion specifier.
    % eliminated unnecessary buffer conversion in *nix builds

Yes I understand what viktor say , but you maintain

code that not work anymore in HBQT and in hbXBP

the code below was a working code , but actually not

this is why I am insisting in my question.

What I need is that you are saying

"QWebKit is currently not implemented and will stay as is
until this component is made available to all platforms Qt supports."

Thanks

Message-ID: <28364005.post@talk.nabble.com>


If I try to unZip a crypted zipped archive, a -102 ( UNZ_PARAMERROR ) is
returned.
I use hbmzip lib ( and obviously minizip lib, as I use last SVN version ).

I believe to pass the right parameters. What's wrong?
Below a self contained example.
Just strip out the password parameter and all works fine.
TIA.
Maurizio

      hZip := HB_ZIPOPEN( cFName + ".zip" )
      IF ! Empty( hZip )
         HB_ZipStoreFile( hZip, cFName, , "AnyPassword" )
         HB_ZIPCLOSE( hZip )
      ENDIF

      IF ! Empty( hUnzip := HB_UNZIPOPEN( cFName + ".zip" ) )

Hi Przemek & all,

 

Using netiosrv.prg  from hbnetio\utils as the server.

 

How can I see on the Server all active connections.

All open files.  Global /per connection?

Kill a connection.

What happens to a hung up clien (client killed). Is the connection on the
server killed too & it's files closed?

If the server is stopped (quit),  the client stays frozen, it doesn't time
out. Or am I doing something wrong  here?

 

Thanks a lot,

Abe.

Hello Maurizio,

I confirm this problem with sample harbour\contrib\hbmzip\tests\myunzip.prg
also.

myunzip myzip.zip --pass mypass

Can somebody take a look for this issue?

Hello Jorge,

Mediator (http://www.otc.pl) had ported (x)Harbour components to 
Delphi.  Maybe this will give you some idea.

Good luck with your project initiative and surely the success of this 
will drive more (x)Harbour users in the future.

Best regards,
Mario

Looks like the password is ignored when doing the compression.

The error is set in this piece of code (external\minizip\unzip.c):

extern int ZEXPORT unzOpenCurrentFile3 (unzFile file, int* method,
                                            int* level, int raw, const char*

    int err;

    uInt  size_local_extrafield;    /* size of the local extra field */
#    ifndef NOUNCRYPT
    char source[12];
#    else
    if (password != NULL)
        return UNZ_PARAMERROR;
#    endif

    if (file==NULL)
        return UNZ_PARAMERROR;
    s=(unz64_s*)file;
    if (!s->current_file_ok)
        return UNZ_PARAMERROR;

The tests of correctness of file would be ininfluent, as the error is set
only when the password is supplied.
This seems to set the error any time a not empty password is supplied, if
NOUNCRYPT is defined.
But NOUNCRYPT would'nt be defined, so the thing would work as expected.
Maybe the NOUNCRYPY is unexpectedly set?
Just my thought. I'll try to set some tracepoint.
Best regards.

Hi Viktor,
the zipped file IS password encrypted.
If you open it via an archive program the file is correct and the content
can be extracted only suppling the correct password.
The problem is on the unzip job.
Best regards.
Maurizio

Hi Maurizio,

You're right. (I missed a '-' in my test cmdline)

Please retest after my latest commit.

Hi,

It runs. If you're using default build you will need 
libunicows lib and unicows dll to run Harbour applications 
on Win9x. For this and the rest of requirements to 
run Harbour applications on Win9x, see INSTALL doc.

[ 3rd party tools/libs may have additional limitations 
or Win9x requirements. F.e. MSVC 2008 and upper don't 
support it, QT doesn't support it. ]

Hi Pritpal

I will write my first review about HbIDE. It's not a complete review and I
just want contribute to improve this potential useful tool. It's not my
intention to criticize your work, just to show my view about an IDE. Sorry
by my English and sorry if I lost or misunderstand something.

Harbour and HbIDE r14395 (MingW, x86_64, Windows 2008 R2)

Read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern
HbIDE have a lot of inconsistencies. Toolbar, menu and shortcuts need to
consistent. If you keep each method isolated, always you will have
inconsistencies. This is valid for Windows buttons too. Close by window's
close button has a different behavior form other close triggers such as menu
f.e.

All toolbar, and by ALL I mean top toolbar, right toolbar and left toolbar
is in static place. I think ALL components should be dockable.

Editors, Skeletons, Projects and Output panel are not detachable. This is
what I said last week.

All panels detached (not docked) lost visibility when HbIDE is closed and
opened again.

For some panels should be modal windows like you done right with Keyboard
Mapping panel, Tool and Utilities (although it can open just by toolbar):
Project Properties (should be open by Project menu)
Compiler Environments
Theme Manager
Code Skeletons
Last three should be Setup options like KB Mapping and Tool&Util.

Editor as a panel? I don't think so. A menu and/or a drop down button on tab
bar is more appropriate.

Tool&Util button has a drop down menu. His broken. If none tools had been
configured yet, grey the drop down part of the button.

Last button from KB Mapping panel shows somethig like this to me: .:aveA:.
where I presume should be SaveAs. Don't be cheap with button width.

Project Properties -> general is anchored by bottom and vertical alignment
is centered. Don't do that, It's ugly when you resize to show more height to
window.

Find in Files panel looses his position after HbIDE be closed.

When I reopen HbIDE it's never maximized whatever how I left last time.

Panels floating in my secondary monitor are not dockable. For my personal
need and I think many others programmers, working with 2 monitors is a must
have. For me, implement multi monitor support is a must have for any
professional IDE.

Command impossible to be select should be grayed on menu and button and
disabled on keyboard.

View menu use to be next to Edit menu.

It's confusing see -1, -2, -3, etc on sub-menu of Encoding menu. Or use
complete name or just the number without "hyphen".

Word Wrap (auto line break) is absolutely necessary (and I know this is hard
to be done accordingly).

Nice touch highlighting each 10 line numbers, I don't remember to have seen
this before. Now you can put a column numbers bar (horizontal rule).

I think is unnecessary say that column mode is broken for now, but nice to
try.

Double click on a function name (on functions list panel) should jump to
function declaration. (or I miss something)

How I can delete a view?

Why toggle mark command is only on toolbar?

What's Toggle Animation? I have no animation, good luck for me :-) I don't
want animation on my IDE.

About zoom I get this from your website:
"Note that there is no way of returning back to original font. The only way
to achieve so is either close the instance and open again or re-run hbIDE."
Why? This is absolutely necessary.

Why hbide.ini file has "cryptographic" information?

I hope to can write more tomorrow.

And I got this error when I open an specific .prg

Thanks Antonio.
I will post a line-by-line reply shortly.
I am happy that someone has looked into hbIDE closely with a 
user_critic's viewpoint which will lead to a better tomorrow.

Jorge,

> 1 - How to embedd hbrun inside an application ?

If you look at utils/hbrun/hbrun.prg you can see the way it works.
Or you can just add it as is to your program and call the first procedure
(you might want to rename it) _APPMAIN() with a file name as a parameter.

You need to inspect the license, as the compiler main files are pure GPL
without the Harbour exception.

I think that if you search the list you should find examples posted by Przemek
that do on the fly compilation and execution of prg code.

Read. 
BTW what part of the artical is relevant to what follows ?
Is it ti guide me, what objects are, and, how to program them 
or how should these behave ?



> HbIDE have a lot of inconsistencies.

Well, the word "inconsistencies" is a relevant term.
It is relevant to "what one is used to" and what he encounters
somewhere which is not similar to "he is used". So, in this 
context what you see as an "inconsistency" may be a feature for other.

Yes, they are. 
The "close X" button is a generic one and is present on any window visible
on the desktop. It is usual that at some point of time one accidently clicks
hbIDE's X whereever his aim was another window but he could not recognize
as hbIDE was partially covered by some other one. So the alert is issued 
if he is not making a mistake. Contray to this Menubar->Files->Exit option
and "Exit" icon on the toolbar is specific to hbIDE only and user will ever
click them knowingly, so no alert.

This is a design-time consideration and well thought-of feature.

This again is a design-time thought-of implementation.
I do not want it to get "displaced" by the user and always have 
them handy and at the same place for easy and fast access.

These can be floatable, though, persoanlly I do not like them to hang
anywhere because of always-available-same position.
Subject to group decision.

Yep, this should be like this. I will implement.
Subject to group decision.

It is OK both ways, what is the harm in current implementation ?

No, I find it more convinient than menus.

Yes, it should be like this, but I could not find how to do it in Qt.

May be your system is configured for some other theme, on mine
I see it in proper. Anyway it is a few minutes job to increase the size, 
will be there in next commit.

Good observation, I will fix it.

I could not follow you, please explain a bit more.

It opens in the last exit state always, even if you closed it maximized.
What is your point exactly ?

Are you saying that when docking widget are tried to be placed on 2nd
monitor,
you cannot do so ? Or, when placed on 2nd and you exit hbIDE, these are 
not opened at the same 2nd monitor ? I did not experiment yet, but I think 
you can place them on 2nd monitor

Yes, this should be like this. But because of multi-panel/multi source
editsing 
instances, I could not achieve this in transparent way.

No, it must be one before "Help" always.

This is read as ISO 8859-13,  ISO 8859-14, etc. So I kept it like -n 
Anyway it is not an issue at all.

If I am understnding you properly, are you saying in editing instances 
word-wrap should be "ON" ? I did not see any programming editor having 
this feature. And if some editor has it, I cannot imagine how it will 
work for a programmer. Please support your logic.

Column number bar will be a nice addition. I will try.

It is not "broken". 
It is just not implemented.

Not probably. It should jump to function body.

Where it should be another place ?

May be word "animation" is wrong.
Try it and have an eye on menu-bar, tool-bars, you will see the gradient
effect.

Because of application settings are stored in this format 
by Qt itself. Initially these settings were being stored in separate 
file but due some concerns raised on the list, I clubbed them into one.
At times, it is problematic as Qt tends to do so in a buggy way.

It is a nice experience, keep on writing.

Looking at it. 
Actually I restructured XbpListBox() from bottom-up yesterday.

Hi

To keep a track what I have promised to fix:


Editors, Skeletons, Projects and Output panel are not detachable. This is 
what I said last week. 
//
These can be floatable, though, persoanlly I do not like them to hang 
anywhere because of always-available-same position. 
//
Subject to group decision. 


All panels detached (not docked) lost visibility when HbIDE is closed and 
opened again. 
//
Subject to group decision. 


Last button from KB Mapping panel shows somethig like this to me: .:aveA:. 
where I presume should be SaveAs. Don't be cheap with button width. 
May be your system is configured for some other theme, on mine 


Project Properties -> general is anchored by bottom and vertical alignment 
is centered. Don't do that, It's ugly when you resize to show more height to 
window. 
//
Good observation, I will fix it. 


Command impossible to be select should be grayed on menu and button and 
disabled on keyboard. 
//
Yes, this should be like this. But because of multi-panel/multi source
editsing 
instances, I could not achieve this in transparent way. 
//
To be experimented.



It's confusing see -1, -2, -3, etc on sub-menu of Encoding menu. Or use 
complete name or just the number without "hyphen".

The remaining points:


Command impossible to be select should be grayed on menu and button and 
disabled on keyboard. 
//
Yes, this should be like this. But because of multi-panel/multi source
editsing 
instances, I could not achieve this in transparent way.

Nice touch highlighting each 10 line numbers, I don't remember to have seen 
this before. Now you can put a column numbers bar (horizontal rule). 
//
Column number bar will be a nice addition. I will try. 



I think is unnecessary say that column mode is broken for now, but nice to
try. 
//
It is not "broken". 
It is just not implemented. 



How I can delete a view? 
//
Not implemented yet. Will do it soon. 


Why toggle mark command is only on toolbar? 
//
Where it should be another place ? 


Why hbide.ini file has "cryptographic" information? 
//
Because of application settings are stored in this format 
by Qt itself. Initially these settings were being stored in separate 
file but due some concerns raised on the list, I clubbed them into one. 
At times, it is problematic as Qt tends to do so in a buggy way. 
//
If group decided I would like it to be in another file.

So you haven't set CP correctly.
Copy & past from examples sent by other users without investing
sometime to check what some functions do is not good idea because
like above you "resolved" one problem creating other ones.

You have to understand what different CP functions do before you
will use them and you will find that you can set all what you need
in few different versions.

   SET( _SET_CODEPAGE, <cCDP> ) -> <cPrevCDP>

sets internal HVM codepage which is used in string comparison operation
functions like UPPER()/LOWER()/ISALPHA()/ISUPPER()/ISLOWER()/ISDIGIT()/...
and also as default CP for RDD when new table is open and for GT in
HB_SETTERMCP()/HB_SETDISPCP()/HB_SETKEYCP(). Some GTs also use it even
without calling above functions.
HB_CDPSELECT(...) makes the same job as SET( _SET_CODEPAGE, ... ).

   HB_SETTERMCP( <cTermCP> [,<cHostCP>] [,<lBoxChar>] )

Sets terminal CP and enables automatic translation between <cHostCP>
(HVM CDP) and <cTermCP> in all IN (keyboard) / OUT (screen) operations.
If <lBoxChar> is .T. then it forces using national letters also in box
drawing effectively disabling using CP437 box characters in DISPBOX()
and related functions. HB_SETDISPCP() sets only output (screen)
translation and HB_SETKEYCP() sets only input (keyboard) translation.

When new table is open then you can use CODEPAGE clause in USE command
to enable automatic translation between HVM code, i.e.:
   USE myTable CODEPAGE <cCDP>
It also controls collating order but please remember that it cannot
be used if table contains binary data. If you want to avoid such problems
then you should use the same HVM CP as your tables.
So you can specify CODEPAGE in USE command (or as 7-th parameter of
dbUseArea() function) but you can also set the same CP as you used
in your Clipper/... programs and which is used by your DBF files
using SET( _SET_CODEPAGE, <cCDP> ) or HB_CDPSELECT( <cCDP> ) and
only set valid output CP using HB_SETTERMCP(). In UNICDOE Harbour
builds is enough to make:
   SET( _SET_CODEPAGE, <cCDP> )
   HB_SETTERMCP( <cTermCDP>, <cCDP> )

Subject: [Harbour] Harbour "random" GPFs
Message-ID: <F2CC4C17-9A86-437B-9FEA-88B15C8FFD14@syenar.hu>

Hi All,

Lately I mentioned having "random" GPFs with my live apps 
since changing to Harbour r14336. I also mentioned they are 
gone. This turned out not to be true, they are still present.

I have about 100KB of local .c code, which has been pretty 
much static with only one benign change done in parallel with 
Harbour upgrade, plus USHORT -> HB_USHORT type migration.

The app uses GTWVT and it's built with mingw (tdm latest), 
just as before.

GPF happens at random places, even in kernel, so it must 
be some sort of memory corruption. Users report that many 
times the problem happens when pasting into the application. 
They experience that the app just closes, and I can't see 
a GPF logged for all of these occasions. GPF can happen even 
after short period of time spent in the application, with 
little amount of activity.

It looks like something is lurking inside Harbour code, 
and just by hunch one of my suspects is UNICODE mode build, 
in relation with copy/paste, keyboard handling, or run 
operations.

Any idea what to check, or where the problem can be?
I've reviewed some Harbour code, but could not yet spot 
anything.

Yes.

This restriction is cleared. Latest hbIDE does not create 
hbide.ini in the current folder, instead, other folder. 
Just delete hbide.ini if you have in installation folder and 
most probably it will run.

Someone added this file to .hbp file without mentioning 
it in ChangeLog.

I still strongly suggest for everyone to _locally_ enable 
all sort of stuff required for local debugging work, instead 
of modifying SVN files for this purpose.

In this case it would have been enough to use 'hbmk2 hbide.hbp cppstub.cpp' 
or to create a new file 'hbide_mydebug.hbp' with this content:
---
@hbide.hbp
cppstub.cpp
---
and use 'hbmk2 hbide_mydebug.hbp'

Hi Viktor,

i haven't the requested file "cppstub.cpp" in all my updated harbour sources
tree:

find . | grep -i cppstub.cpp

This is a very long shoot.

I had an GPF problem with an GUI app; this app is meant to run
mainly on Windows and using UNICODE,

The users reported a random GPF with different intervals of
running app time, places and so. I was unable to reproduce the
problem under Windows so I setup an Linux workstation meant
to run the Linux version of the app, and builded in debug mode
( at C/C++ level ) that's when the GPF showed in gdb.

The problem was originated by a wrong parameter call to the 
'hb_cdpUTF8StringLength' function, and the program
sometimes stopped when executing that function and sometimes
in some other different places, so the conclusion was that it was
corrupting memory.

Bellow is the code snippet when the above funct is used:

<c++ code>
wxString wxh_CTowxString( const char * szStr, bool convOEM )
{
#ifdef _UNICODE
  const wxMBConv& mbConv = wxConvUTF8;

  if( convOEM && szStr )
    {
      ULONG ulStrLen = strlen( szStr );
      PHB_CODEPAGE pcp = hb_vmCDP();

      if( ulStrLen > 0 && pcp )
      {
        wxString wxStr;
        ULONG ulUTF8Len = hb_cdpUTF8StringLength( szStr, ulStrLen );
        char *strUTF8 = (char *) hb_xgrab( ulUTF8Len + 1 );
        hb_cdpStrToUTF8( pcp, false, szStr, ulStrLen, (char *) strUTF8, ulUTF8Len + 1 );
        wxStr = wxString( strUTF8, mbConv );
        hb_xfree( strUTF8 );
        return wxStr;
      }
    }
#else
</c++ code>

The wrong call was due to calling the function with an NIL
as parameter without checking for a valid CHAR param
passed:

<c++ code>
wxString wxh_parc( int param )
{
	return wxh_CTowxString( hb_parc( param ), TRUE );
}
</c++ code>

The fix was to check for a valid parameter ( not NIL ) being
send to the above function. In fact this problem would be solved
at PRG level but an protection at C++ level was also added too.

Hi Teo and All,

Thank you for your input. My code doesn't use any UTF8 
calls, nor does it make any direct OS calls, or 3rd 
party lib calls, it's pretty simple stuff, with extend/item 
and GT API calls, only few .c level string manipulation, 
and it has been checked using valgrind, too. It's not 
very high suspect. (though I'd be happiest with zero line 
of local .c code). I also use hbwin, but again only simple 
stuff (no OLE, .dlls), and only in isolated places.

I will switch to non-UNICODE to see if this changes anything.

Viktor

Pritpal i have delete the cppstub.cpp compile directive from hbide.hbp it
compile fine, but i still get this error on hbide startup

** (<unknown>:28981): CRITICAL **: atk_object_set_name: assertion `name !=
NULL' failed
hbide.prg:326:HBIDE:CREATE(): HB_TR_ALWAYS HbIde:create( cProjIni ) #Params=

................................... EXIT PROCEDURE hbxbp_End()    begin
xbpgeneric.prg:0:HBXBP_END$(): HB_TR_ALWAYS
................................... EXIT PROCEDURE hbxbp_End()    end


Pritpal please try on your Ubuntu 9.10 installed in Virtualbox here detailed
terminal command to test hbide start

cd $HOME/src/harbour/contrib/hbide/
hbmk2 hbide.hbp -rebuild
sudo cp hbide /usr/local/bin/.

to check which hbide (from which path is called) type:

ls -la $(which hbide)

in my env the "which" command return:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 6697913 2010-04-27 17:23 /usr/local/bin/hbide

is ok then create a temporary dir to work with hbide from it
mkdir /tmp/p
cd /tmp/p
hbide

Best regards,
Marco

This is I call inconsistent. In case of accident, the user can open it again
without a danger.  The user wants be cautious? Ok, IDE need have a option to
all close application triggers request a confirmation. IDE need to be
flexible. Each programmer has its own workflow.

I think toolbars need to be more granular too. Toolbars should mirror (or
almost mirror) the menus. Should have a file toolbar, a edit toolbar, a view
toolbar, a build toolbar, etc, etc.

Give options to user is always a good decision on a IDE. Remember each user
have a different monitor setup. Think about 1, 2, 3 monitors, thinks about
full screen and wide screen, or portrait x landscape position, or entire
monitor to IDE x shared screen with another app.

it's ok, but HbIDE looks less professional. This is inconsistent. Setup has
rare use. I don't wanna give a bad idea, (please, don't do this): If Theme
manager, Comp Env, etc should be a panel, KB Maps, T&U should be too. Setup
is modal window.
Sorry, i have difficulty to explain with more details in English.

top of editor and collateral should be reachable by a drop down and keyboard
shortcut (to navigate to back and forward, I didn't try this yet) and to
consistency (not for my need) the same should be in menus too.

Menus is almost useless for me, I am writing about this just to be
consistent.

I am not inventing nothing here, I just write what I see on applications
like that.

When I reopen HbIDE and I manually turn visible my panels on secondary
monitor (like I left before close IDE), Documentation panel, Function List
panel are on same position that I left last time (floating of course, as I
left), but Find in Files have a different behavior and it shows floating on
primary monitor in different position that I left.

My concern is about inconsistency about the behavior. If there is this
inconsistency, I think others panel have or could have inconsistency. You
need to find a way to all panel have the same behavior whatever you program
them. I didn't read the code in deep but I think that each panel have its
own code to control the panel behavior. If this is true, it's not a
consistent way to go.

I can put panel floating on 2nd monitor but not dock on a windows on 2nd
monitor. I can dock if I resize window to my 2nd monitor too, but this is
not multi monitor support. I need get an IDE with appropriate multi monitor
support to understand better. Multi monitor It's a little tricky.

And I need more "docks" to place my panels. If I didn't lost something I
have only right and left docks to drop the panels. With 2 monitor I can have
Find, Documentaion, Function List, Snippets (Skeletons), Project files, and
the Editor (or editors splitted), all visible at same time on my screen.

sudo cp hbide /usr/local/bin/.

This is not enough to copy only hbide to bin.
All its directory, I mean, contrib/hbide/. has to be copied.

Are am I missing something ?

hbide locates its components from hb_dirBase() as a base folder.
It write to hbide.ini at the time of exit and not at startup.

Good points, I agree with them. Consistency and 
flexibility as known from other GUIs/IDEs is very 
important, and IMO in Harbour our job at the moment 
is not to reinvent IDE idioms, but to follow what's 
already developed (Eclipse, MSVS). We can be different, 
if it means better, but ppl have certain expectations 
when working with IDEs, and we should rather try to 
satisfy them than forcing something unusual.

my 2 cents.

Please tell...
then we must give write permission to a system dir...?
or we must run hbide as root...?

Thank you

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but on *nix systems, 
such external static files belonging to an executable, 
used to be installed into /usr/share, meaning /usr/share/hbide/ 
in case of HBIDE.

Eventually HBIDE should also look at this location 
on *nix system to find these files.

I think you are correct, as usual.

Ok i want make it running IMHO forcing some standard

copied entire hbide sources dirs from harbour/contrib/hbide to
/usr/local/bin/

sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/hbide
sudo cp -R hbide /usr/local/bin/.
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/hbide
mkdir /tmp/p
cd /tmp/p
hbide

Deleted i supposed not required files from /usr/local/bin/hbide/ dir

in the dir i leave this files:

drwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 2010-04-27 18:34 docs
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2243660 2010-04-27 18:15 hbide
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1150 2010-04-27 18:15 hbide.ico
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    3168 2010-04-27 18:15 hbide.ini
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     413 2010-04-27 18:15 hb_out.log
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 2010-04-27 18:33 projects
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 2010-04-27 18:33 resources



Basically it works but with standard permissions user hb_out.log and
hbide.ini cannot be write in that position then all default are related to
/usr/local/bin path
I suggest you to choose a different dir to store hbide settings:

i suggest you and i instruct the installer to create a .hbide dir into user
$HOME directory
then as Viktor suggest to create a /usr/share/hbide dir to other resource
(read only mode)
and in the bin directory we can put only the hbide executable file without
create subdir and modify user PATH.

Thank you,best regards
Marco

the host program is done in other language, not harbour.

and if i open hbrun thru the shell then i will obtain the same speed as CGI.

i want a module, kind of similar to an hipothetical mod_harbour for apache.

its easier to develop such a module for my server because i can simply
change my server internals to match harbour needs.

i will say in another way : i want to embed the harbour virtual
machine into my https server.

Maybe I'm talking nonsense but I don?t know how can you integrate both 
programs/compilers in a mutiplatform way.
If it was windows only you could use some dll pre-loading mechanism.
Otherwise you will have to run both program in parallel with a messaging 
system tru tcp-ip/pipes/DDE or VM_* notification thing.
I think the only integral solution is to rewrite your http server in 
harbour.
Now it has more speed and very good multithreading support.

Just food for thought

It can be done using .so (For unices) and .dlls for windows...

This matches a whole bunch of possible platforms.

My server is already multithreaded and supports SSL.

Is anybody working on adding SSL support for uhttpd ?

I think you need to keep an informal roadmap with features which not be
implemented very soon. You implement many features in hours or days, but
some of them need too much time and an informal roadmap would be useful. But
this is your call only, I just gave a idea.

Some random ideas not organized in any way (not my
priorities neither the easiest feature comes first):

About word wrapping: maybe you know this feature as line breaking, I think
this term is more appropriate to programmers.

Toggle option to shows blank characters independently (space, tab, line
feed, line break) and choose the character and color to shows.

Include line numbers configuration in theme manager.

Code Folding.

Edit:
Spaces to Tabs
Trailing spaces
Low->Upcase
Up->Lowcase
Split, Join and swap lines
Duplicate selected lines (or text)

Option to use tabs or spaces (number of columns or spaces configurable).

Encoding conversions.

Backup policy configuration (HbIDE keep last N versions of file).

Usage Search (context menu) to find usage locations from a function.

Copy to Clipboard with formation (keeping syntax highlite).

Full screen mode.

GoTo/View Declaration (context menu, maybe opening a new tab or splitting
editor) When parameters tips is not enough.

Highlight current function on Function List panel.

Show file size and other properties of current file on status bar.

I prefer Snippet term to Skeleton according to Viktor's view. Snippet is
more standard term but I have no problem with Skeleton problem.
I think Snippet/Skeleton placement need to be more smart but I will describe
this later.

Task/ToDo List

Clipboard manager

While debugger is not possible, put a BreakPoint in code (Just an implicit
AltD(), right?)
Just to you think :-) Historical Debug AKA Time-Machine Debug AKA
Intellitrace

Sticky notes

Database editor

Macro recorder

HbIDE have command line options?

Most of suggestions above are not my priority, I think editor and core
should be the priority and I will try focused on it.

Later this week I will write some suggestion about navigation code. This
point need to be really improved.

I wanna see some refactoring on code to make HbIDE more extensible friendly.
I like to see an API.

Thanks for your effort.

Hi

As a lot changes have been committed, here I only outline 
my tests on two-monitor system.

Now I got what are you talking.
Study the code, it is already implemented like this.

And I do not. It will remain as is curremt.

These can be docked any-monitor. I have tested and confirm it.

Now every panel behaves the same way. There is no command applied

Update from SVN again, all is behaving as you desire.

You may be right, but this needs a editor overhaul which at the moment 
I am not competent enough. In future I will see it I could implement it.
Current base implementation does not support it.

I am trying and am almost there, but do not know how to handle 
extended caret position beyond end of line. Qt does not provide any 
such mechanism. But still I am optimistic for its fruitation.

On menu it has little usage and no point to bulk them.

When we started hbIDE project, there was no roadmap of any kind. It was a
shot 
in the dark. xMate was/is my only source or tips and I followed it closely
while
implementing the extra features as I thought were appropriate and others 
suggested on the list.

Now it is almost usable, in fact I have put my production projects onto
hbIDE 
altogether, and only visit xMate where intensive column based copy/paste is 
required, and hence we can draft a roadmap now.

I entrust you can do this very well. Just maintain a list what is missing
and required,
and chances are I will implement them as soon as possible.

So these become a part of roadmap. You need to compile on a 
periodical basis what is still left.

As already explained it needs a big overhaul, so a candidate for distant
future.

Added to my todo list.

Is already there.

Together with word-wrapping implementation as this also falls 
in that category.


Edit:
Spaces to Tabs                        =   Tabs to spaces is useful and is
implemented, why this is needed ?
Trailing spaces                         =   Ok.
Low->Upcase                           =  Is already there.
Up->Lowcase                           =  Is already there.
Split, Join and swap lines            =  I need more input.
Duplicate selected lines (or text)  = duplicate current line is there,
selected text ?, ok will see.



> Option to use tabs or spaces (number of columns or spaces configurable).
> 

A candidate for final "Setup" dialog, I have put it to last.
But probably we must not go towards <Tab> inculsion. Many of the 
repositories are immune to it. Also we do not advocate it in Harbour SVN.



> Encoding conversions.
> 

Ok.



> Backup policy configuration (HbIDE keep last N versions of file).
> 

Yes, and a must have, and is on my todo list.
But before I start, we must be very clear how and where the backups 
will saved. So far I am not been able to devise a proper location. 
Remember, hbIDE is a Project Builder and Text Editor two in one,
Projects are independant of editing sessions, though I save a source
if it falls in included project(s) before building.



> Usage Search (context menu) to find usage locations from a function.

Please be more subjective, I am unable to follow this point.



> Copy to Clipboard with formation (keeping syntax highlite).
> 

Where this information will be used ?
Syntax highlighting are a rule and not an attribute of text itself.
Yes, if we know the target where it will be used, we will encapsulate 
thus target to honot syntax-highlighting rules.

This works fine on my machine, anybody else with this issue ?

If you inspect Status-bar, it is already cluttered.
What other properties of the current file should go there ?

I wanna see some refactoring on code to make HbIDE more extensible friendly.
I like to see an API.

Building blocks are already there. Keyboard Macros! Can be extended any
length.

Thanks for such extensive input.

Hi Pritpal

I reply your message tomorrow. Before I go to bed I suggest you read this
page about importance of UI:
http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/fog0000000249.html

Do you know Joel? All programmers should know him. I agree and disagree with
him on individual topics but he becomes a reference to programmers on a lot
of topics.

For same reason that spc->tab is needed. To meet all programmers need not
just the ones using spaces for tabulation.

Should be target independent, export to clipboard with formatting is IDE

In name of flexibility status bar items need to be configurable. Many items
there is useless for me but others is needed. The user should choose the
right items for him. This is turns status bar more useful to individuals
reducing the clutter.

The second one is almost a joke. This is relatively new technology. It's
very hard to implement although I think not so much to Harbour. But first we
need to have a solid traditional debugger.

The code need to be more friendly to any programmer call some functions to
extend IDE's functionality. HbIDE should be a public and stable API to users
extend IDE easily. Something like a plugin system, but because the open
nature of project, more flexible and more simple.

I have difficulties to write in English so I need to write less than I would
like and I write wrongly more than I would like.

I am interested in this question too. This is important to me, so that I can try 
and automate a recovery.

HBIDE is meant to edit all sources, not just and not 
particularly our own ones. It's nice to enforce some 
good practices (f.e. automatic formatting along with 
Harbour SVN standards as a default), but there are things 
which may quite well may be different in other users code, 
along with their own preferences or heritage. TAB vs. spaces 
and indentation width are such things, so ideally HBIDE 
should make it configurable to fit users' existing coding 
style.

IMO HBIDE should offer Harbour standards as default 
and let user override it.

I'm not sure this is priority, given that it seems 
to need tricks on certain platforms. F.e. Opera OS X, 
has such mode and it means all standard parts of the 
screen (like menubar, dock) is hidden and only the 
app content is visible on screen, even without window 
borders or toolbars. Firefox OS X does the same but 
it leaves the url/navigation toolbar visible.

There are plenty of 3rd party apps doing that 
perfectly. It's unnecessary to clutter HBIDE with 
such thing IMO. Same goes for task/project management, 
and the already dropped web-browser.

Besides duplicating efforts and losing focus, it also 
make HBIDE heavier and heavier, and I'm not sure it's 
good idea to pull in large amount of unnecessary 
code into memory just to edit source files.

[ BTW, IMO the documentation editor is already somewhat 
off-place. ]

Definition of damn good:

* help to edit code (code and symbol completion, parameters tips,
conversions, some code generation, suggestions, etc)
* tools to search and navigate through code easily and fast way
* don't be intrusive
* have every tool in hand (mainly by keyboard)
* totally configurable

+1 for all of these.

For anything else, probably an open plugin 
architecture is the best, so all of the 
remaining bits (like PostIt notes, GTD stuff 
can be implemented and maintained by users).
We have the full power of .hrb files as a 
base for such.

Ok, I got it. Will include soon.
To be exact, not every element in themes manager belongs to a label 
having attributes such as type,size etc. Yah, line numbers are certainly in
this 
category but rest every element is a syntax rule and is implemented
differently
than what we preceive for a text label.

It is not our goal to make hbIDE universal as yet. So I will look

This is available under "Find-in-Files" protocol. Tell me if that is not
enough.

Oh, I get it.
But this is not possible as I stated earlier. Text editors are not a RTF
oriented.
They are plain text oriented and highlighting is applied to them under
totally 
diiferent way which in turn does not offer those attributes to be copied.

You have it.
First time( after projects are defined ): Re-tag all projects through
"Projects Functions"
Every next time: Right-click on a function name in the editor and select
"Goto Function".
A new editor will open up. If there are more than one source will have that
function's body,
"Projects Functions List" dialog will show up for selection.

I think I have included everything on the "Welcome" tab on "Stats" panel.
Click on any node in "Projects" and you will be shown all sources contained 
within with many attributes, viz., size, last modified, etc. Tell me what 
else would/should be included there.

This would certainly be a very good feature.

Should be easy. Let us think some other details which may be imposrtant.

This will be also be a good feature.
Note: color syntax details will certainly be missing.
Should every item be "named" like snippets or just ...
Also, should the contents be persistent or only for current session?

As stated on my web-site also, I am poor in debugging protocols and 
have little insight how it can be implemented in a transparent way in hbIDE.

Just like clipboard manager or todo list. Are easy but before we must

It should be easy though.

It's not the same.

Typo in "Find-in-Files": Expressior

I think ENTER should trigger the Find button action.

Try the good enough first and we see the results to think
about enhancements to the feature.

You could try to use the Harbour model about separation of core and
"contribs/plugins" even when the plugin is 100% yours.

Just to fill your dreams, think about slots defined by plugins on status
bar, menu bar, toolbar, keyboard mapping, panels (new ones). Think about a
ease way to plugins hijack editor behaviors to modify them. Just some
free thoughts.

Rather use -i option or point to xhb.hbc file.
(or simply copy your sample to contrib/xhb/tests/ dir 
and issue hbmk2 from there)

You need to replace 'TXmlDocument(' with 'TXmlDocument:New('

Victor,

If TXmlDocument( cString, HBXML_STYLE_NOESCAPE ) is a valid call, yet does 
not produce a correct object (given that I probably haven't seen the code), 
then can't TXmlDocument(...) check that :New is in the calling tree and 
produce a decent error?  (Sorry if I'm stating or overlooked the obvious)

Yes, it would be useful error to cover this case.
This is a common problem when porting code from 
xhb to Harbour. I don't know how to implement it 
though.

Anyone?

Typo. Replace it with: 'TXmlDocument():New('

Anyhow not everything is fine with xhb xml support, 
as I'm getting memory corruption with the posted 
sample when trying it with mingw. It runs fine 
with msvc64.

I have noticed quite a few fixes over recent years/months to the XML source in 
xHarbour, it's possible that Harbour has missed something important.

Could be. I'm not very convinced about the whole quality 
of this xml implementation. The xhb patches didn't convey 
any good impressions either. Many of them were debated 
and fixed back and forth, so I lost track of it.

It's also possible I broke something in this commit, 
while trying to apply recent xhb memory-leak patches:

Message-ID: <x2s6943770e1004281446xb9808d16t6b0c26f9c91d92e9@mail.gmail.com>

I wanted to create a QTableWidget and populate it with different values.

My code is:

 for i:= 1 to len(aL)
    aAdd( oGridItem0x0 , "" )
    t := QTableWidgetItem():new()
    t:setBackground( oBrushBackItem0x0 )
    t:setForeground( oBrushForeItem0x0 )
    t:setText( "cella "+str(i) )
    oGrid:setItem( i-1, 0, t )
 next

The result was that only the last cell has value... this happens
because when t is re:New()ed, the previous t is destroyed ... so
::setItem needs  treatment for detaching it when calling setItem....

So please apply this patch:

HB_FUNC( QT_QTABLEWIDGET_SETITEM )
{
    QGC_POINTER_QTableWidget * q;
    QGC_POINTER * p;

    HB_TRACE( HB_TR_DEBUG, ("Entering QTABLEWIDGET_SETITEM" ) );

  q = ( QGC_POINTER_QTableWidget * ) hb_parptrGC( hbqt_gcFuncs(), 1 );
  p = ( QGC_POINTER * ) hb_parptrGC( hbqt_gcFuncs(), 4 );

  if( p && p->ph && q && q->ph )
  {
     HB_TRACE( HB_TR_DEBUG, ( "QT_QTABLEWIDGET_SETITEM() Qt oject: %p
is attached to: %p", ( void * ) p->ph, ( void * ) q->ph ) );
     p->bNew = HB_FALSE;
     ( q->ph )->setItem( hb_parni( 2 ), hb_parni( 3 ), (
QTableWidgetItem * ) p->ph );
  }

}

PS: why didn't you use my patch to have the "exceptional" functions
out of qth files ?

Because we are not to deal with a whole new set of files which 
may go unmanageable in the long run.

Also we agreed that this mechanism will be usedonly where we have 
problem with the destruction mecanism.

Local aItems := {}

 for i:= 1 to len(aL)
    aAdd( oGridItem0x0 , "" )
    t := QTableWidgetItem():new()
    t:setBackground( oBrushBackItem0x0 )
    t:setForeground( oBrushForeItem0x0 )
    t:setText( "cella "+str(i) )
    oGrid:setItem( i-1, 0, t )
   aadd( aItems, t )
 next



  // And destructor
  for each aItm in aItems
     qItm := NIL
  next

This mechanism has an advantage.
You have all the control over items spread in different columns,
and can later deal with them if there is a need of changes, for example,
if you would like to let it be edited or changing the colors.

This is how it looks close to Clipper syntax.

not really. this mechanism must be used when a object becomes owned by
some other object to avoid a double destruction...

Probably I should go directly to xbp (I see you wrote tons of code
lines for the browse system) strictly following the published code and
try to never read the source code because I "fear" that there are some
"hacks" to overcome some hbqt problems....... :-)

> Local aItems := {}
<cut>
this was the first test I did in order to check that no other problems
were present... and it worked.
But I feel it is not a correct way... since there is no need to store
them from a functional point of view.... i

I can do this using ::item(row,col) if necessary....

But not to c++ samples...


More, some other patches should be done, for example for
QTableWidget::setCellWidget... please read the doc text...

There another probable problem if the patches are not committed... if
you have not compiled my patches try my unmodified sample but change
only:
oGrid:setItem( i-1, 0, t )
to
oGrid:setItem( 0, 0, t ) // all items set at the same place

does it GPF ? with setCellWidget it will according to the doc text....

Ciao,

Hi Francesco

The whole point is, if we go this direction, 
I am afraid a lot of .qth have to be changed.
Everywhere there is a parent/child relation.

Probably I do not feel comfortable this way.

Hi

Consider this scenario:

If this approach be taken, then it becomes 
impossible to release the memory occupied by those 
QTableWidgetItems any way until application is closed.
Suppose in between you are to clear the table many 
times and need to reuse it, application will constinue to 
consume memory.

We used this mechanism where we had a problem to 
to freeing the memory. In QTabelWidgetItem/QTreeWidgetItem, 
etc., where nodes can be in abundance, this is not appropriate.

Hope my point will be clean by now.

I think my above statement is _WRONG_.
Please ignore it.

And today I am the victim of this strange behavior.
Since morning I am struggling to locate where it does happen.

I am implementing horizontal ruler in hbIDE and 
have to change/add some methods in hbqt_hbqplaintextedit.cpp/.h
Sometime the same code goes through and I can see main window.
Then I add a variable in .h ( just add ), link it, and voila 
it GPFs. I did not use this variable anywhere yet.
Then I delete this declaration, but still GPFs. 
I build clean complete Harbour, GPF vanishes, I introduce something,
again GPF. 

Certainly I am unable to exactly locate in which circumstances 
and under what flow it is generated. This is on my office machine.

Later I will copy these two files on my laptop and will see what is the 
behavior and will report here. Just today has been wasted altogether
without any output.

It was just to inform.

If this is required to fix HBQT, it should IMO 
be done eventually. It's not an argument against 
fixing things that it takes many source code 
changes IMO...

Hi Przemek,

Life saver patch, thank you very much.

My non-UNICODE app build wasn't installed 
yet by users, anyhow now I'll push a new 
version using latest Harbour in UNICODE to 
continue with live tests.

As for clipboard encoding I agree to sync, 
although the best would be to always use 
UNICODE to push/pull from the clipboard 
if that's possible.

Viktor

Subject: [Harbour] Removal of non-UNICODE Windows codepath?
In-Reply-To: <E1O7PTD-0001QJ-Af@sfp-svn-4.v30.ch3.sourceforge.com>

Hi All,

If that simplifies things (which it definitely does), and 
the majority of developers agree with it, we can drop 
non-UNICODE mode altogether from Harbour source code.

It's unlikely we shall ever support Windows 3.x or Win32s, 
and unicows solution works just perfect now to cover Win9x/ME 
host versions, so I can see no hard reason to maintain duplicate 
code paths for both UNICODE and non-UNICODE Windows API 
support.

Having only UNICODE path could greatly simplify code in 
many crucial points, making it easier to maintain, 
extend, debug and keep bug free. Especially if we want 
to move towards internal (HVM) unicode support in the 
future.

Any opinions on this?

Viktor

Hello Viktor,

> Any opinions on this?

Sorry, but I don't agree with removing the non-UNICODE mode from Harbour
source code.
My working environment is Win98SE and it will create the additional
difficulties for creating and managing of the Harbour compiler (for me and
for clientes with Win9x).

BTW There are the Windows applications in two builds - UNICODE and
non-UNICODE.

Thanks for attention!

Did you try to use unicows lib? If not, I'd 
suggest to try it, since it solves this problem 
in quite simple way. All you need to do is adding 
-lunicows to your hbmk2 make file and bundle 
unicows.dll with your app. Works with all supported 
Harbour compilers. Get prebuilt libunicows binaries 
from here:
   http://libunicows.sourceforge.net/

There are, but it's unnecessary in case of 
Harbour apps, and it's generally not a very 
good idea from several aspects to have 
different binaries for U and non-U.

Viktor,

What is special about "non-unicode Windows" in compare to other
non windows OS that are currently supported by Harbour? Can't it
be just considered another type of Os?
(I know that in maintanance therms, it is best to have less variations
as possible)

Hi Chen,

All Windows API calls that has to do anything with 
strings have two versions: one which deals with 
"ANSI" (8-bit) string types and another flavor which 
deals with "WIDE" (UTF-16 aka. "UNICODE") string types.

Every time Harbour has to call a Windows API function, 
which has two versions, we need to take care of both 
types to maintain compatibility with both normal 
(non-UNICODE) and UNICODE builds.

F.e. when we call GetCurrentDirectory(), it will be 
translated to either GetCurrentDirectoryA() in 
non-UNICODE (= "ANSI") call, or GetCurrentDirectoryW() 
UNICODE (= "WIDE") call when '-DUNICODE' compile-time 
option is used. The two modes will return different 
string, so we need to deal with it differently to 
convert it to Harbour string. We have a quite 
sophisticated set of functions and macros to deal 
with the issue.

In pure UNICODE mode, we could either define 
-DUNICODE as static option, or replace all Windows 
API call to WIDE flavor (f.e. GetCurrentDirectory() 
with GetCurrentDirectoryW()) and drop all the code 
which deals with the ANSI type.

On WinNT and newer Windows OSes, the ANSI Windows 
API function (*A() calls are wrappers to "native" 
WIDE ones, so they are slower than direct WIDE calls.

On Win9x/ME there are no WIDE functions implemented, 
so there the ANSI versions are the native ones. This 
means that apps built in UNICODE mode won't work 
by default on these OSes since the requires WIDE 
function calls are missing from system libraries.
Microsoft developed a solution though, which is 
UNICOWS.DLL, and this .dll provides WIDE wrappers 
to native ANSI ones, when the executable is run 
on such old OS version. On NT and upper OSes, 
it's invisible and doesn't cause any overhead.

> be just considered another type of Os?

Could be, but it would require lots of duplicate 
code, and such solution would be in essence a reworked 
way of keeping two parallel versions of every code 
which calls the Windows API. Overall, we wouldn't 
gain much at the end after a painful conversion 
process.

Yes.

In continuation...

Whenever I change something in hbqt_hbqplainttextedit.h 
( for this matter it could be any .h in hbqt ), and compile/link 
the application GPF certainly appears.

But if I build clean hbqt, application behaves properly.

So I suspect, because .h in hbQT are subject to "moc" application,
something gets weired with signal/slots addresses. It is corrected 
only if all moc_*.cpp's are included at once in the lib.

I am not sure if this points to real cause or not,
but am 100% sure that rebuild of hbQT after a change in .h 
( no matter that change is only a blank line or any variable 
declaration which has never been used in the code ) 
GPF happens. After clean build, I can make any changes to 
.cpp without GPF's.

Someone can confirm this behavior on their setup ?
Or I have something terrifically mis-configured environment 
on my machine ?

One problem may be that when you change a 
HBQT header, the related moc_*.cpp file will 
be rebuilt and compiled, but the related .cpp 
file will not be recompiled.

Also, if you update an #include-d header, 
like hbqt.h, a full rebuild is always necessary.

The fact that moc_*.cpp files are included in 
lib at once or one-by-one should never make any 
difference. They are fully independent sources.

If this happened just now, there is a change to 
find out the exact reason: make a full rebuild 
with HBQT r14412, then update to latest source, 
do an incremental build, make a backup of 
all generated files (moc_*.cpp and objects), 
then make a rebuild and compare generated 
files if there is a difference.

TXMLDOCUMENT is inside xhb lib.

With my hbqtgen patch there is no need to change .qth files, just to
write the specific new functions (that may be automatically generated
once we set the necessary info somewhere)

May I ask why ?

It's just a bad sensation or are there more technical reasons ?

I would like to keep support for non unicode windows builds.
I do not see anything what give noticeable simplification in
Harbour core code because we will still have to keep support
for other platforms which do not use unicode. For me native
Win9x support is as important as WinCE port and I want to be
able to create application which can be executed on Win9x without
any overhead due to dummy emulation layer and I do not plan to
fight with any more or less important problems or incompatibilities
in libunicows and look for workarounds or send patches to the
authors.

libunicows is just an open source, compiler portable 
variant of the unicows import lib + load code to be 
able to use the actual wrappers in unicows.dll 
(shipped by Microsoft) with all compilers (not just 
MSVC). So there is nothing which you need to fight 
with here. It just works and the code stable since 
long years.

As I mentioned already, but maybe it wasn't clear, 
the whole wrapper logic (or "dummy calls") is completely 
inactive on WinNT and above platforms, so for any 
apps that are designed to run on these platforms 
in the first place (using UNICODE), there is _no_ 
_overhead_ when using unicows. On Win9x, you indeed 
need to go through the wrappers, but given that 
these systems are much of an exception these days, 
it looks a much better compromise for an app than 
having the go through ANSI to WIDE wrappers on all 
modern (> WinNT) operating systems, which are the 
waste majority.

BTW I expect the overhead to be minimal for GTWIN/GTWVT 
apps, as there is not too many UNICODE sensitive 
calls used in normal app operation, and practically 
none when doing processing using pure Harbour code. 
Pls correct me if I'm wrong with that assumption.

To put this issue into wider Win9x perspective, most 
Harbour apps, even when using non-UNICODE builds, 
will need to have these extra Win9x components to be 
able to run properly or at all:

95/95B/98/ME/NT: http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc60pro/update/1/w9xnt4/en-us/vc6redistsetup_enu.exe
95B: ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/vrdrupd.exe
95: http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/e/0/0e05231b-6bd1-4def-a216-c656fbd22b4e/w95ws2setup.exe
[ all listed in INSTALL. ]

BTW, can you tell some examples where you still 
need to design apps to run specifically on Win9x?

Hi Viktor,

Sorry but I do not understand why do you want to delete
already working code.
In longer terms it may cause that we will create problems
for platform which do not use Unicode forcing Unicode everywhere
reducing Harbour functionality to current Java or Phyton level.
For me it will be end of this project.

Perhaps you misunderstood me, but I'm not saying to 
"force" unicode "everywhere". Only on Windows API 
calls in Windows specific code parts. This has nothing 
to do with Harbour core functionality, which can continue 
to support everything it supported thus far.

The reason for my initiative is that we have quite 
limited resources, and if you ask me, I used to spend 
lots and lots of time to make code work in both modes 
(not to mention the other variation on Windows platforms). 
Even this lots of time is not enough to test it properly, 
as practice shows. I'd assume the same is even more 
true in your case. We have 200 '#ifdef UNICODE' branching 
in Harbour codebase, which is quite a lot. Not to 
mention other developers who'd like to contribute; very 
few ppl can provide code which doesn't need local 
tweaking and retesting.

When in the future Harbour will have internal UNICODE 
support, we will have to face the problem again, since 
we will need to support 4 types of conversion when 
interfacing Harbour HVM with Windows API (8bit-ANSI, 
8bit-WIDE, UNICODE-ANSI, UNICODE-WIDE, plus the same 
in reverse direction). Which doesn't seem like making 
things simpler.

I'm sorry if this is the end of the project for you, but 
I had preferred to see some real argument from your side, 
it's possible I'm missing something or my assumptions 
or general view of the topic is wrong, and in this case 
I'm happy to be corrected, so that at the end we make 
the best decision based on real facts and discussion.

For sure you have something, if keeping non-UNICODE 
support is such important issue for you.

All this has nothing to do with becoming Java and 
Python, it's only a technical detail which doesn't 
change much fundamental from usability or 
portability POV.

[ BTW, unicows usage support could even be made simpler, 
or fully transparent, if needed, but it's already 
extremely simple, so I didn't even think about it. 
It was enough to spend quite a few days on the topic 
to actually making it as simple as it is now. ]

Still awaiting for your actual arguments, as your time 
allows.

I have still not yet found an explanation as to what the "unicows solution"
is, despite reading all the unicode threads.  Perhaps I am not seeing
something right in front of my eyes, but as far as I know, now one has said
"this is the solution, in unmistakable steps"... all i have heard of is one
word:  "unicows", and not any steps to take.

I tried sticking the unicows.dll where I was executing the .EXE file on a
Win9x machine and our program just hung doing nothing.  Compiled without the
unicode, the .EXE then works on Win9x.  So the thought of moving in this
direction worries me.  When I compile Harbour for our use, we turn off
UNICODE mode with a compiler switch everytime to avoid all this confusion.

If the solution is having to run a packaged unicows installer on the Win9x
machine, then this will become a nuisance for a few hundred people.  If a
.dll can be simply placed somewhere, then that is okay... but as I've said,
this didn't solve anything when I tried doing it.

PS:  I could care less about Win 3.1x, but some people (surprisingly) still
use Win9x with our program.  Perhaps they are afraid of technology?

It definitely sounds like a good idea that would save a lot of time for the
Harbour project, so obviously it has my vote provided I can find a simple
solution my concerns above.  :/

I've written down detailed steps at least 
three times on this list, last time in this 
very thread.

There is no special thing in it though.

> I tried sticking the unicows.dll where I was executing the .EXE file on a Win9x machine and our program just hung doing nothing.  Compiled without the unicode, the .EXE then works on Win9x.  So the thought of moving in this direction worries me.  When I compile Harbour for our use, we turn off UNICODE mode with a compiler switch everytime to avoid all this confusion.

I wouldn't "promote" a solution if it didn't 
work. Here it works, the way I described it.

The components are also listed in INSTALL.

Quote:
"in quite simple way. All you need to do is adding 
-lunicows to your hbmk2 make file and bundle 
unicows.dll with your app. Works with all supported 
Harbour compilers. Get prebuilt libunicows binaries 
from here:
  http://libunicows.sourceforge.net/"

[ Forgot to mention here that this requires recent 
Harbour version, 2.0.0 release won't work. Maybe 
worth to note that  ]

Both can be done. The .dll by itself is not 
enough though.

I also have clients using Win98.

I have not found that in the INSTALL doc...

G:\ver10\harbour-dev>grep -in unicows INSTALL
630:                                 UNICOWS solution to support Win9x/ME

1414:      Windows UNICOWS runtime/import library [win, free, open-source]
1415:         http://libunicows.sourceforge.net/

Not even the hint that -lunicows is in there.  I am not sure where you got
that quote from, perhaps you are quoting something you said in the past.  In
either case, I have found that produces an hour when I compile harbour devs
with win-make myself (which is my only choice, as 2.0.0 is the last stable
bundled released, afaik).

The components are listed there, not the 
step by step guide. I've simply e-mailed 
the latter 4 times already to the list.

The method consists of downloading a lib 
(unicows) and adding it to the liblist.

You are missing the component 'unicows' library.

Download it from above link, unpack and copy to one 
of the existing lib dirs, or point to it using -L 
(libpath option).

Message-ID: <g2t674e4ddd1004291700lee47a7afsaef4cdacd3cc428d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I was wondering if anyone knew or is writing some sort of Harbour
functionality that could be used to parse MS Excel files, before or after
2007 file formats, etc etc.  Interfacing with Excel would be kind of nice,
and I am not really finding any good solutions...  just wondering if anyone
had any hints.

I also saw an xls2dbf converter by some guy called WhiteTown, but it's
license is not flexible.

Any hints greatly appreciated.  If all else fails, maybe I will have to
write a C++ app that can do the translation via a 3rd-party lib.

Thank you

Hi smu,

You just need hbwin to create an ole object. 

local xls := win_OleCreateObject("Excel.Application").

xls:Open()
xls:Close()

Message-ID: <970D858F16184FB9BCD12ADB6E7328D1@emag>

Dear friends, can you tell me if there are any known issues with Harbour and 
Microsoft's Server Message Block technology? It is a caching technology 
which will delay the writing of data to shared files on a Windows server. 
SMB2 is new with Server 2008 and Vista / Windows 7 clients. I'm wondering if 
that technology will obey dbCommit() commands in Harbour, or if it simply 
ignores them.

Thank you.

Subject: [Harbour] ACHOICE() bug for 2010, with simple hello world example
Message-ID: <m2r674e4ddd1004300204ra72ab188pd3141a9b1c1bfe44@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Here is a proven section of code to denote a Harbour / Clipper achoice()
difference.  From looking at the difference, I believe it is a simple fix.
But this I cannot guarantee (yet).

Anyways, the code + comments will summarize everything.  But in a nutshell,
it is this:  the cursor position of the called function doesn't always show
up vertically where the choice selection is.

Thank you in advance for taking a concern in this.

___CODE:___

// The seconds() should appear to the right of the currently highlighted row
// This works until you arrow past the top of the list or use the right/left
arrows, in which case it
// always uses the last row of the screen coordinates to print the seconds.

// In this program, there are only 5 rows for 10 letters of the alphabet, so
in the case described above,
// it will always print the seconds on the 5th (bottom) row when left/right
is hit, or the top array
// value (a) is reached.

// For others' curiosity sake, I found this bug because in my program I am
trying to highlight an item in red,
// or position a get text field on the row they are on.

// This has been tested in Harbour and CL52e, and Clipper does it correctly
where the seconds() printed text is not
// positioned incorrectly.

Func main()
    cls
    a:={"a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"}
    x:=achoice(1,1,5,20,a,NIL,"myfunc")
Return Nil

Func Myfunc()
    setpos(row(),Col()+20)
    devout(str(seconds()))
    if lastkey()=13
        x:=1
    ELSE
        x:=2
    endif
return x

      I enabled it for some local tests and by mistake committed to SVN

I just started looking at the code:

NETIO_CONNECT( [<cServer>], [<nPort>], [<nTimeOut>], ;
                   [<cPasswd>], [<nCompressionLevel>], [<nStrategy>] )

nTimeOut defaults to -1 if you don't set it, and I guess that means no timeout.

Note, I haven't run any code or confirmed my guess by digging deeper.

Hi,


I see no problem for Win 3.x and Win32s, we still have customers with 
Win9x. Many of the projects are contained in the only .exe file, so 
requirement of extra .dll is not nice. One more thing is that my 
libraries are non-UNICODE, but I do not see a big reason to do rewrite a 
working piece of code until HVM internals does not allow to contain 
multi-language strings and rewrite do not add new fuctionality.

Maybe some macros like HB_PARSTR() can help to implement a good layer 
for UNICODE/non-UNICODE versions of app. It can help to make code clean 
and easy maintainable.


Regards,
Mindaugas

Hi Mindaugas,

> I see no problem for Win 3.x and Win32s, we still have customers with Win9x. Many of the projects are contained in the only .exe file, so requirement of extra .dll is not nice. One more thing is that my libraries are non-UNICODE, but I do not see a big reason to do rewrite a working piece of code until HVM internals does not allow to contain multi-language strings and rewrite do not add new fuctionality.

Pls remember that you may well need other extra 
.dlls/packages anyway f.e. to run Harbour apps 
on Win95/Win95b and other combinations, like 
mingw/msvc builds and Win95-98. Chances are high 
though that unicows.dll and these other extra 
packages are already installed by now (had 12-15 
years to do that), if not, there are simple MS 
packages users can install on these PCs. My point 
is that it's unavoidable anyway to deal with the 
"extra package issue" when running Harbour apps 
(and many other apps) on Win9x, and that such 
issue is not very hard to deal with, since there 
exist official MS package for all of them, and 
the packages are well documented even in our 
INSTALL doc.

Other libs and local code are unaffected by 
Harbour core's UNICODE mode. So while I see your 
point, this is not something which has any 
technical influence on our decision.

> Maybe some macros like HB_PARSTR() can help to implement a good layer for UNICODE/non-UNICODE versions of app. It can help to make code clean and easy maintainable.

It covers part of the problem, but doesn't cover 
other 200 code sections, where these functions 
cannot be used. These are usually code sections 
which deal with the conversions on the low level 
(as opposed to simply accept/return Harbour 
function parameters, like with HB_PARSTR() and 
friends).

Thank You for another great piece of code. I'm trying to understand the 
ideas of this.

In case of item stream, received items are buffered on client side and 
NETIO_GETDATA() return array of items. In case of char stream, data is 
concatenated and NETIO_GETDATA() return a single stream. Function 
NETIO_GETDATA() is not blocking function and returns NIL if no data are 
received. Am I right?

You've mentioned in the past, that these communication streams allows 
server application to give access to local resources like COM ports, 
etc. In most cases, f.e. COM port, communication is bidirectional, but I 
found communication stream unidirectional (from server to client). How 
do you suggest to do data transfer in the opposite direction?

In the sample code, the communication streams are closed after 
NETIO_DISCONNECT(). Is data transfer allowed in between of 
NETIO_DISCONNECT() and NETIO_CLOSESTREAM() calls?

Are connection stream ids unique among multiple connection? As far as I 
can see, each connection has it's own connection ideas, and this 
requires to use additional cServer and nPort parameters to distinguish 
different connections.
I see s_fileGetConnParam(), hb_socketResolveAddr(), s_fileConFind() in 
NETIO_GETDATA(). Isn't this a bottleneck for applications what needs a 
lot of data transfers? The same question for RPC calls.


Thanks again, regards,
Mindaugas

I also tried all the suggestions figure out but unfortunatly it doesn't
work:
The mistake is:

Compiling 'xml1.prg'...
xml1.prg(17) Warning W0001  Ambiguous reference 'TXMLDOCUMENT'

No code generated.
hbmk2: Error: Running Harbour compiler (embedded). 1
(/usr/bin/harbour) -n2 xml1.prg -w3 -es2 -o/tmp/ -i/usr/include/harbour -i..
-i../../hbct -i../../hbtip -i/usr/local/lib/harbour


Thanks in advance

I think that viktor say that  try to test your sample in test folder

in order to hbmk2 use the hbmk config file from tests samples

Copy your prg to xhb test folder   and try to compile  without use any
option

only hbmk2 <your_prg>  and make sure that hbmk.hbm file is present

I've found some msgs about it. In my gmail the first reference is:

Well we have a ton of people who still use Windows, and because of
that we need a Windows solution.

I am happy to report that after about 30 mins of Googling, I came
across this page, which solved the problem, if you disable SMB2.


http://blogs.msdn.com/robmar/archive/2009/09/23/get-microsoft-fix-it-for-smb2-issue.aspx

It's amazing, as we have spent countless hours Googling for this
months ago, and relied on .bat files that worked 80% of the time.  So
far, this works 100% of the time.

This is a miracle for us!!!  We've worried for 6 years about this problem.

Hi Francesco,

Can you test following Harbour call, to see how well it works?

   ? WIN_OSNETREGOK( .T., .T. )

(you need to be logged in as administrator to make the above 
call successful)

Viktor

Sorry, I can't make any significative test right now.

Yeah, this SMBv2 patch fixed everything for us.  It became a problem when
SMB2 was running for doing .dbf file access over a simple run-of-the-mill
Windows Shared Network.  We could have used HBNETIO, but we didn't want to
have to change hundreds of lines of code where the NET USE code would end up
going.

Anyways, please let me know if the smbv2 disable patch works for you.  If
you are doing what we are doing, which is filesharing, only the host of who
is sharing the files needs the patch installed.

Something extraordinary.
Harbour community will ever remain indebted to your contributions.

I have already started base work how effectively I can port 
my applications to reside on server for their better part.

Thank you for such excellency.

Hi Viktor,

It turns out that my tests of doing the devout calls to the screen in Win9x
with the unicows solution is about 2 or 3 times slower than non-unicode
compiled .EXEs on the same machine.  And this is with Przemek's SET CURSOR
OFF trick as well for Win9x machines...

So this simple test and its performance hit would leave me to conclude that
the unicows solution isn't 100% perfect.

Just my two cents.  If it cannot be solved, then I suppose my vote would be
to still keep the non-unicode mode...?  I don't know enough about Harbour to
see the implications :[

Update:  well I did a raw DEVOUT for loop test, and it was a only about 10%
slower.  The 2 or 3 times slower claim was in the ap we use itself, where we
have another test which does almost the same thing, and it is about 2 or 3
times slower...  not sure what really is responsible, only thing I know of
that changed on my end was the non-unicode / unicode build...

*confused*
