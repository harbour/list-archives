David:

 Thanks for the details! Do you know what the mystery 12th parameter
 was ever used for? It seems to be NIL everywhere, so I'm guessing
 it's just a holdover from an early version of COMIX that got dropped.

 Please confirm the first point:  For Clipper5.3 the documentation for
 ordCondSet is wrong, and in fact there's an extra parameter in the
 12th slot, making lAdditive the 13th?

 If so, the current Harbour ordCondSet is NOT compatible with Clipper.

 Now all we have to do is determine if we want to be Command
 Compatible, Function compatible, Docs compatible, or Bug
 compatible....

Very nice! ;-)

Some observations:
- I got a error at line 9 (Syntax error) (on every page)
- The red triangles in the roght side table have a broder
  around them
- The menu's all go to your side, better let them go
  to http://www.Harbour-Project.org. Even better is to
  put the doc pages to Phil's server. You can send me a
  zipped file from the HTML's. I will upload them if you
  want.
- Maybe their should be a "Home" (home to the 1st page
  of the documentation site) link in the right hand table
- Look at http://www.conex.com.br/user/culik/hbdoc/thtml.htm
  after "WriteParBold(<cPar>) Same as WritePar()..."
  the text is bold.
- This link does not work:
  http://www.conex.com.br/user/culik/hbdoc/directory.htm

Great work Luiz! Thanks! ;-)

I have been reviewing Luiz great Harbour doc html pages,
and I have found there are missing many classes on it.

Only Harbour Class TClass is (so bad) documented there.

I have not reviewed everything but I want to notice that 
we may have a superb software, but if we don't have the 
right docs, then we won't be able to let others know the
full potential about it.

We are all responsable for keeping updated docs.

I'd probably write "HARBOUR" in mixed case, not all upper case.

"Categorie" should be spelt "Category".

You're suffering the same copyright issues that Patrick was.

I get Javascript errors in Netscape 4.77 (although I can't get Netscape to
tell me what those errors are at the moment).

Yes, the Clipper documentation is WRONG in OrdCondSet()
Clipper DBFNTX only use 11 parameters
Clipper DBFCDX and Advantage use more than 11, where 12 is NIL and ADDITIVE
is 13, and so on
You can review my code for the use in Clipper DBFCDX and Advantage

> If so, the current Harbour ordCondSet is NOT compatible with Clipper.
I have not tested it, but I think that OrdCondSet() in Harbour contain this
exclusion of parameter 12, spoiling the rest parameters

As discussed in other times, documentation should not be an "MUST", because
have some errors

The objective should be Command and Function compatible, Docs may be left
out and in bugs, mmmmhhh....., only those convenient to Harbour

The text doesn't appear to have changed at all. Am I missing something? Did
you change it to my suggestion or did something else happen?

It now says:

Hi Antonio

Should'nt I had __CLASSINS() just calling __CLASSINSTANCE() 
to improve the level of compatibility ?

Any other know similar case ?

To ALL ;

I'm not dead ;-)), I'm working to the scoping problem wich in fact is 
linked to John's problem.

Actualy, When a method is calling a super:Method wich in turn 
also call Super:... the result will be disastrous :-(((( I have the 
'theorical' solution but it is really hard to implement. I will probably 
need one or two more week to have a 'good' solution. 

Last but not least, I would like to know who is working with M$ 
Visual ++ and wich version is used. I can't have the HB_errRTxxx 
function to work here with VC ++ 6.0 SVP4 (Tryed with SVP with 
the same result, GPF :-((( )

Originally it was named as __CLASSINS() but later on
(probably Victor) renamed it as __CLASSINSTANCE(). I agree
on the idea of having a __CLASSINS() too, to avoid the
same question again and again :-)

You are doing a great job on classes.c. Please notice
I have implemented some extensions on it for the profiler
support.

I remember vaguely a discussion about variables used in function as such

There is a warning about bTwo on the bOne declare. Is this known, and to be

Don't worry, I'm working on one of the latest classes.c (with your 
profiling functions). I hope it will not change to much before I finish

On a big application, putting Profiler() in Exit Procedure
causes the app to stare the sky alias dying ( not responding )
Is it the behaviour of Profiler ? How to properly calls it ?

The profiler takes its time to generate its report.
(there is a huge information to report).

And it is to be used by the programmer, not by the 
final user.

Yes, the 12th parameter for ODRCONDSET() must be set to NIL, which
shifts all subsequent parameters, starting with lAdditive, over by one
slot.

:-(

I would have guessed Clip-4-Win's Application Classes do this fairly
often.  I've not noticed any "disastrous" result. :-)

OTOH, maybe that is the cause of the reproducible hang I sometimes get
- i.e. maybe I _have_ noticed the result but just didn't know what it
was due to.

For the sake of consistancy, could we come up with 'the plan' for creating
the downloads so everyone gets the same thing no matter the target or
compiler?  (I kept the rdd out since that's what happened last time...)

I include RDDADS in my alternate binaries, because in previous builds,
it was the only way to successfully use database files. And becuase I
create my "official" binaries from the same build and !pack_bin includes
all files in the lib directory, my official builds also get the RDDADS
binary. For the next build, I could change my build procedure to include
RDDADS with the contrib binary instead of the harbour binary.

 I can only guess an error says AdsSetDateFormat() doesn't exist
 (please include full real error msgs when reporting a bug).

 This function is in the rddads.lib, so either he's not linking it in,
 or perhaps there's a long function name problem?

That's the problem,... I can't give you anything to recreate the

Dear Friend

I like to announce that i´m working to enhace the current version of hbmake.

The new version will include the follow

Support for :
#iffile   Test for existence of files
#! run an command
#stdout  Prints an message to the screen
Support for .rmk Files (by using -r switch,it will read the rmk file,and
then create an new file with all depencencies include in the old .rmk
file,so the user can use the new makefile with the features that hbmake
have)
Support for multiple depencies lines
    Ex: CFILES = a.c b.c \
        e.c
Enhacementes on the #ifdef also add the #ifndef statement

Suggestions are welcome

I dont know.
Below is the complete message from where i get the bug report

Lo ultimo que yo tengo del Harbour que entrega fivewin es la 0.36. De FWH la
1.7.Esta un poco inestable. La 1.6 es mas estable. (Han tocado algo de
Fuentes en Windows y dialogos y a mi por lo menos no me va bien)
Y la de harbour me da errores en el RDD ADS como por ejemplo en el SET DATE
que dice no tener la funcion.

  OK, I'll change ordCondSet. When I do, everyone who uses those
  indexing features will have to be prepared to change their code or
  headers.

  I was hoping Alexander would be able to review the impact on the PP.
  I never fully understood why one INDEX ON command couldn't cover all
  the indexing clauses in Clipper. I think the need for XINDEX had to
  do with using extended expressions for some clauses...

Paul,

See your private E-mail, I sended you dbfcdx.lib (from the very last 
CVS) as rtl.lib. I discovered Yesterday that only replacing rtl.lib 
with the one from the BIN image is enough to have the runtime 
working without GPF.

Thanks,

Asunto: Memoline bug


Ignacio:
        Antonio suggested I resend this since I apparently sent it
        when you were traveling. Tab characters can cause a gpf in
        memoline...

  There is a very serious bug in Memoline and mlcount.
  It does not handle Tab characters correctly, and will overrun the
  output buffer, causing a gpf later on that takes a day to debug :-(

  Though I had modified that code some months ago to fix another bug,
  I have been unable to see the correct fix for this after a few
  hours of chasing it.
  The tracking of the beginning- or end-of-line (as affected by Tabs)
  of the source becomes confused with the tracking of the assignment
  of characters to the output buffer.

  With the current Harbour, this small test will have a memory
  overflow:

   cStr := chr(9)+ "  "+chr(9)+ 'xxxxxxx'+ "yyyy"
   ? "1:"+memoline(cStr, 10, 1, 3)
   ? "2:"+memoline(cStr, 10, 2, 3)
   ?
   cStr := chr(9)+ chr(9)+ 'xxxxxxx'+ "yyyy"
   ? "1:"+memoline(cStr, 10, 1, 3)
   ? "2:"+memoline(cStr, 10, 2, 3)
   ?
   cStr := chr(9)+ chr(9)+ chr(9)+ 'xxxxxxx'+ "yyyy"
   ? "1:"+memoline(cStr, 10, 1, 3)
   ? "2:"+memoline(cStr, 10, 2, 3)
   ?

  The first problem is that the second TAB terminates the first line,
  which correctly prints out blank. But the second line works off of
  ulLastSpace, which only sees spaces and doesn't recognize Tabs as
  word delimiters, so it starts at the wrong position and tries to
  include the second tab in the second line.  I thought I had a fix to
  this problem by adding this change:

         case HB_CHAR_HT:
            ulLastSpace = ulCurLength + 1;  // <<<<< ADDED THIS LINE
            ulCurLength = ( ( ULONG ) ( ulCurLength / ulTabLength ) *
ulTabLength ) + ulTabLength;
            break;

 But it doesn't help or even makes worse other conditions with Tabs.
 You can see from my attached code where I trapped the over run and
 tried to trace the values. The big problem is that (ulPos +
 ulSpAdded) must never be greater than OR EQUAL to ulLineLength. In
 some cases the overrun is by 2 characters, not just 1.

 Let me know if I can help any more with this.

Hi,

Are we gonna provide Borland c++ 5.0 / 5.2 / 5.3 build of Harbour?
If not, I need to delete these entry's on the download page.

Luiz:
Can you compile the spanish Norton Guides?
Can you upload the new documentation web pages to the Phil's server? 

Can someone build 0.37 Simplex builds for:
- 16 Bits DOS (Borland C++ 3.1)
- Windows 32 bits (GCC 2.8 RSXNT)
- OS/2 (GNU C (2.8) / EMX)
- OS/2 (IBM VisualAge C++ 3.3)
- Linux (GCC / ncurses)

In the above, why do the Free Software Foundation get a mention? As I'm
reading the above it would seem that it's telling me that if I add GPLd
code, that isn't my copyright, into harbour or mix it with harbour sources,
that code doesn't "acquire" the exception (as it shouldn't, that makes
sense). What I don't quite follow is why the FSF get a special mention here.

Patrick,
There are some problems with download files:
1. Documentation files in english are in format *doc.en.*,
                   but in spanish are in format *doc.*.es.* 
2. You still give link to the old zlibsrc 
   instead of new                 hbzlibsrcnew
3. There is a name harbour-slx-0.37.bin.win32.bcc32.zip 
   instead of      harbour-slx-0.37.bin.w32.bcc32-551.zip 
4. The file /etc/script.zip has attributes 600 
   while all the other files have          644.
5. The file /etc/harbourwebsite.zip contains old website files so it should
   be named      harbouroldsite.zip.
   There first one should contain offline version of the current site,
   I think.

tracked down Antonio's original post to comp.lang.clipper regarding a

In case anybody is hoping that I will, seeing as how I created the Flex
builds for those platforms, let me disabuse you of that notion! Creating
the Flex builds for those five (and three others, for a total of eight,
multiplied by two different distributions) is more than enough Harbour
building for me...

Because the Harbour Exception started out as a verbatim copy of the
Guile Exception, which then had all references to Guile changed to
Harbour, and that mention is in the Guile Exception.

I was browsing the harbour site from work today and was tickled to see my name
in the The Crew section.

I do need an update though.  Because my isp changed its name some months ago,
my email address is awhite@mail.rosecom.ca

Could a responsible person update this, please :-)

Yeah, that's the sort of thing I had in mind. If you're happy with it you
might want to slap it on the harbour "art" page for download.

Not on my part. I left it in, because it was my understanding that even
though the Harbour Project hasn't turned the Harbour copyright over to
the FSF (and probably won't), Harbour was still the "official" FSF/GNU
implementation of Clipper. I posted the proposed Harbour Exception to
the developer mailing list and committed it to CVS in the
doc\hdr_tpl.txt file and asked for comments, but received none that
indicated that there should be no mention of the FSF.

That would have been accidental on my part if nothing else, I didn't notice
it or think of it as any kind of problem then. Doubtless I wasn't alone.

Noted, thanks. Button grabbed and used in the footers of my harbour pages.

Any chance of any comeback regarding the corrections I gave for the 3rd

It is irregular and/or inconsistent. What if there are more language files?

The same as above. All the other files are *.w32.*


Now doing a new check of www.

1. The documentation pages are not updated. The only working link is GNU and
the rows in the menu table are very strange...

2. There are links to local disk (I:) in the menu tables on the
"Documentation download" page.

3. There are bad links in the menu table on the "Mailing lists" page.

4. The text about Extended systems on the "3rd party members" page is still
in <font face="Times New Roman">.

5. The up-arrows are on the left or in the centre, on the line or over the
line, without any special order or need. The "goto" arrrows look similarly,
with no special mean.

And I have some idea about the arrows.
The arrow up means "up to the top".
The arrow directed to the text could mean "on this page" like that:
  [ menu_row <- ] or [ -> menu_row ]
The arrow directed out of the text could mean "another page" like that:
  [ menu_row -> ] or [ <- menu_row ]

6. The ship on the button gif without a mast looks like "The Flying
Dutchman". I'd rather stay in the Harbour :-)

 No problem, I think. Can you send me the right syntax of this command
 ?
  Probably, INDEX ON isn't the only command, which differs in Harbour
 currently from 5.3, because I use 5.2e and had in mind 5.2e commands,
 writing the pp table.

Antonio and JF:

 I don't know if it's because of the Scope stuff or the Profiler
 changes, but with the current CVS our app gpfs at startup in __ClsNew
 trying to create a bitmap. A small FWH test does build and run OK.

 If I restore classes.c, hvm.c and dynsym.c everything works OK, so I
 have to guess it's the profiler code.

 For now, I have to revert back to .37

  You're either missing or have a bad ACE32.LIB.
  You can create it with implib from ace32.dll

There have not been scope changes since .37 (I just checked changelog)
so the profiler may be the reason for that.

Could you please just restore hvm.c and try it again ?
I would like to know which of those three files is causing
the problem.

Thanks!

Hi Brian,

I did'nt publish anything since 0.37 so I also think it could be 
related to the profiler.

Brian and I have been tracing the problem,
and it seems still there is a problem with 
hb_clsDictRealloc().

It is not related with the profiler, except
that as the method structure has grown, now
there is a different memory consume, that it
is revealing the bug.

Humm, bad news for me :-(((((((((

Should you have a small sample pointing the bug ?
In all case I will review the function.

JF,

That is the problem. On small samples it is working
ok. Only Brian's app is GPFing there. A pMsg pointer
in invalid. I have been cheking memset() and seems ok
(where the allocated memory is initialized), so either 
hb_clsDictRealloc() is working bad or some other function 
is invading the classes methods memory area.

Thanks!

The one we had available on the web site was version 2.7 from May 2000.
I have version 6.0 on my PC. Should I put version 6 online?

 I think, 5.7 is enough. Those, who are specially interested in 6.0,
 can get it from Extended Systems site.

Antonio & JF:

  The gpf happens when creating TBitmap, a grandchild of TWindow.
  At the bottom of this msg is the last piece of my trace file showing
  two traces with the original BASE_METHODS setting of 100.
  In __CLSADDMSG I traced the string passed in, the value retrieved
  from hb_dynsymGet, and the pointer of pMessage.
  In hb_cls_MsgToNum, where it gpfs, I traced the pMsg pointer (the
  final trace).

  A few bits of information emerge.  First, the bad pMsg is clearly
  unlike any of the other pointers arriving in that function. It also
  never went through __CLSADDMSG as this is the only instance of that
  pointer in the trace.  It looks like a misplaced random value.
  This is also called from hb_clsDictRealloc. The long list of "pMsg"
  traces without any calls to __CLSADDMSG is from the realloc.

  (BTW, this may be unrelated, but the trace shows a BLANK Msg
  apparently created for TClass .)
  
  But after changing BASE_METHODS to 2400, there are no calls to
  hb_clsDictRealloc and it gpfs in a different way.
  It's reported in the Harbour stack in __CLSADDMSG -- it's blowing up
  in my trace trying to dereference pMessage->pSymbol->szName, and
  pMessage was just retieved by hb_dynsymGet!
  __SUPER 00CE59B8  is bad in the symbol table.

  So it looks to me like something in the new code is trashing
  symbols...
  I've attached my classes.c in case you want to see where the traces
  are.  Be sure to set HB_TR_FLUSH=1 for HB_TRACE to get flushed!

Brian, JF,

Thanks for your research,

>   symbols...

There is no new code. There are just two new METHOD structure
members, and these simple assigments:

In hb_objGetMthd():

      pMethod->ulCalls++; /* Profiler */
      ...
      s_pMethod = NULL;  // Just in case a method was not found
                         // and a built-in is going to be supplied.

In HB_FUNC( __CLSADDMSG ):

      pNewMeth->ulCalls = 0;
      pNewMeth->ulTime = 0;

How can that code corrupt the methods memory ?

This is why I think that still there is a bug in hb_clsDictRealloc()
that randomly appears on a certain memory consume.

Antonio

The problem is obviously in hbmake.prg, not in Harbour (the warnings
have nothing to with this and have been present for a very long time).
What happened is that Luiz added a local HB_OSNEWLINE() function in
hbmake.prg without putting an #ifndef __HARBOUR__ / #endif block around
it.

Subject: [Harbour] Need the rtl.lib for VC++ from the last CVS image to debug GPF
Message-ID: <200107092246.AAA21296@pyxis.wanadoo.be>

Hi,

Paul or anyone using VC++, could you dowload the last CVS 
image and recompile using VC++? I've traced my GPF problem to 
the RTL lib and now I would like to compare it with one working. 
Actually, using the one from 0.37 allow me to work without GPF 
when reaching a Runtime error. So I'm thinking to compare my 
(bad) RTL.lib and some good one but to do so I need to work on 
the same image.

The name was (almost) corrected, but it still is on the bottom menu, instead
of the top one.

Most these warnings seems incorrect :-(, i.e. this is line 3805 in ppcore.c

   if( isalpha( szProspect[0] ) || szProspect[0] == '_' )

There are many other lines with [0] subscript without such warnings???


> ../../cmdcheck.c: In function `hb_compChkCompilerSwitch':
> ../../cmdcheck.c:265: warning: subscript has type `char'

Also these are lines 264-5 in cmdchk.c

                          Switch[2] = Args[i][j + 1];
                          if( isdigit( Args[i][j + 2] ) )

Both i and j are defined as int??? Yet for some odd reason 265 produces a
warning, while 264 with same subscript syntax does not (as it should not)???

Do you mean an EXTERN declaration to force linkage? If so it seems
reasonable.

Antonio & JF:

  The gpf is simply in the structure definition.
  I can add ulCalls, but either of the other two causes the gpf.
  It's a stucture packing issue, my guess was it's brought on by the
  BYTE member. I can take the working .37 build and just add ulCalls
  and ulTime to this structure and it blows.  I can stop it from

Brian,

Today I will be all day out of my office.
Tomorrow I plan to keep searching for the bug.

You are right, it probably may be an alignment
related issue.

It's just a flag to know if the class data has yet been initialized or 
no, it's type has no importance (could be byte or long).

Normaly not, but I will review the code with this in mind...

Ron, they're correct. All of them. This is the only line with a isalpha() call.
ISNAME(), for example, has an explicit cast to int.

Ron, it's not the subscript sintax which gives a warning but the call to
isdigit() which needs an int while Args[i][j+2] is a char. All other calls to
isdigit() have this explicit cast!

And I don't see ctype.h included while you need it if you want to call an
isSomething() function.

regards.

Brian,

I think the error is in line 102 of browse.prg. It first displays the
status area and then stabilizes the browse. While the browse is not
stable you are on a different record since stabilization moves record
pointer to fetch needed rows.

regards.

I got confused by the warning text. I would expect it to mention implied
parameter type conversion. The "subscript" reference threw me off.

See above. IAE I fixed both.

ctype.h is an #include in hbcomp.h which is included by both files. I
actually just removed redundant explicit #include ctype.h (and few more)
from ppcore.c

BTW, the "might be used uninitialized" warnings are incorrect, at least in
the case of the files I'm familiar with. This is an obvious limitation of
static checking.

Thanks for the clarification.

Subject: [Harbour] Harbour version of Dbc is released
Message-ID: <10221421619.20010710142724@belacy.belgorod.su>

Hi,
  I've uploaded today to my site the Dbc utility, built with Harbour
  and ADS ( version 5.7 ). It's a good demo of a current Harbour
  state. I recompiled Clipper sources of Dbc without any changes,
  caused by language incompatibility. I only was need to drop some
  Assembler written addon's and have added few specific functions (
  switching between local/remote server, between ntx/cdx/adt ). I
  rewrite also SQL engine. In DOS Clipper version it parse the SQL
  expression and use some logic, implemented with Clipper to do the
  query. In Harbour + Ads version it uses native Ads SQL possibilities
  and is more fast and powerful.
  Note again, that it is built with 5.7 version of ace32.lib, so
  appropriate dll's should be used with it.

No, they are correct. The complaints are for the isalpha and isdigit
macros, not the szProspect or Args subscripts.

Have you noticed any problems with ace32.lib created for one version
working with a later DLL?  I'm pretty sure at least that if you use
the .lib for 5.7 all calls are compatible with DLL upgrades, so the
v.6 DLLs should in fact work fine. Otherwise anytime a user installs a
different app with upgraded DLLs, the first app will fail. So far, I
have found Extended Systems' DLLs to handle such "Version shock"
better than anyone.  Please let me know if you've seen any problems in
that regard.

LRCG> Can you provide some small sample of the use of ADS RDD with SQL commands

 Below is the set of functions, intended for ADS SQL:

  - adsConnect( server_path ) -
     connect to Ads server, using the path as parameter;

  - adsCreateSqlStatement ( alias_name, file_type ) -
     create structure, used by following SQL queries. First parameter
     is the alias name of the cursor which will be returned by query (
     ADSSQL is default ),
     file_type - type of tables ( ADS_CDX, ADS_ADT );

  - adsExecuteSqlDirect( query_string ) -
     execute query;

  - adsPrepareSql( query_string ) -
     prepare query string;

  - adsExecuteSql() -
     execute previously prepared query;

  - AdsGetConnectionHandle() -
     returns handle of current connection.

 To execute a query, you need:

   adsConnect( path )
   adsCreateSqlStatement ( , nFileType )  // ADS_CDX or ADS_ADT
   adsExecuteSqlDirect( cQuery )
   ...
   USE  // Close cursor and statement

   Below is fragment from Dbc, which executes query:

   IF AdsGetConnectionHandle() == 0
      IF Empty( mypath )
         AdsConnect( "\" + CURDIR() + IIF( EMPTY( CURDIR() ), "", "\" ) )
      ELSE
         AdsConnect( mypath )
      ENDIF
   ENDIF
   IF Select( "ADSSQL" ) > 0
      Select ADSSQL
      USE
   ELSE
      SELECT 0
   ENDIF
   IF !AdsCreateSqlStatement( , nFileType )
      Alert( "Cannot create SQL statement" )
      Return .F.
   ENDIF
   IF !AdsExecuteSqlDirect( textquery[ 1 ] )
      Alert( "SQL execution failed" )
      Return .F.
   ELSE
      IF Alias() == "ADSSQL"  // Query returned cursor
        ...
      ELSE
         Alert( "Statement doesn't returns cursor" )
         Return .F.
      ENDIF
   ENDIF
   

   As you see, when query is executed, workarea opens with alias
   ADSSQL ( or other, designated in AdsCreateSqlStatement() call ) and
   you can work with this workarea, as it is usual db file ( with some
   exceptions - and it is have no much sense to update the data in it,
   because it isn't real db file ).
   And yet another note - cursors, returned as a query result, are in
   adt format.

 Before I had some problems, but now I can't reproduce them. It seems
 that application, built with ads32.lib from 5.7 really works with
 latest ace32.dll .

 Yes, ADS supports standard SQL syntax, but to be sure you should read
 docs about ADS SQL. Possibly, ADS and Foxpro has their own
 limitations/additions, which could be incompatible in some cases.

I made a big change for proper handling of international characters and
asked for as much testing as possible, due to the changes involved (one
of which was removing the tests for -16 and -32, because I thought that
other tests that were added would eliminate the need for those tests).
Nobody ever reported any problems until now, so as far as I knew, the
changes worked...

Probably not, because from what I recall, that causes even more
problems. But I need some help from you to figure out how to fix it
properly. Could you please build a new GTWIN library after removing the
comment block markers from the '#define HB_DEBUG_KEYBOARD' near the top
of gtwin.c?

Then build the inkeytst program in the tests directory and run it with
the SKIP command line parameter and with the output redirected to a
file. Then press several of the cursor keys that give you problems.
Finally, send an me an email (either directly or to the mailing list)
with a list of the keys you pressed with the redirected output file
attached.

This should let me figure out the correct tests to add in to fix this
problem.

Subject: [Harbour] :class revisited
Message-ID: <8698560302.20010711221442@abacuslaw.com>

JF :

 I have a FWH database class, and a database with a field called CLASS
 that we've discussed in the past. Normally, if I need to reference
 oDbf:class I use
  #define HB_CLS_ALLOWCLASS

 But there's apparently a problem using that directive
 at the top of a prg that declares a different class.
 It blows at runtime with:
    Error BASE/1004  Class: NIL has no exported method: INITCLASS

 But I am declaring a DataWindow class that manipulates a database class,
 and needs to reference ::odbf:class. But I cannot use
 #define HB_CLS_ALLOWCLASS
 because it blows up, but without it, there's no way to reference
 ::oDbf:class.  So I cannot ever use ":class" in the methods of any
 other class, which makes "#define HB_CLS_ALLOWCLASS"
 only use-able in procedural code.

 There is a workaround I'm doing for my app, so I don't *need* this
 fixed. But you may want to consider whether people should be able to
 have an iVar named "class" that can be accessed in other class's
 methods.
 Then again, you may understandably prefer to go fishing :-)

You should'nt use it, as it is intended to enable a full class 
message 'a la class(y)'. So it could not help you here.

You should use the following in place ;

at the top of your prg, and before #include hbclass.ch, define the 
followings, (same as within hbclass.ch but for class(y) ; 

#define HB_CLS_FWO
//#define HB_CLS_CSY
#define HB_CLS_VO
#define HB_CLS_TOP

It should allow you to use ::Class without problem.

 Ok, I've sent it to your private address.
 BTW, I don't think, that it's right:

  else if( ch < 0 )
  {
    ch = 0;
  }
  else
  {
     if( ( ( ch == 0 || ch == -32 || ch == -16 ) && ( ... ) )
     ...
 
  You see, this condition: '|| ch == -32 || ch == -16' never can be
  reached, because all ch < 0 are checked in previous  else if( ch < 0
  ).

Source for these is in the contrib\libnf directory.  Depending on the

Hi all (not fishing) Harbourer,

Could you please stress a bit my last change about the scoping ? 
(Maurillio ? if I remember, you had a problem with Tbrowse ...)

Also, now, MethodName() (should) return the real MethodName 
even in case of multiple Super calling.

It seem there is something wrong when calling Super from an Inline 
but it was a bit late this morning so I will see it later. Any feedback 
welcome.

Hi Paul,

I always have this incredible problem where my RTL.LIB is 
corrupted when compiling it by myself. I would like to compare 
each object one by one but to do this I need a working one based 
on the same CVS image and preferably the Last one.

Could you compile from the last CVS a simplex RTL.LIB and send 
it to me at this address ?

TIA,

Hi,

latest cvs code creates a not working hbtest (os OS/2 GCC at least)

The error is in line 350 of hbtest.prg

       bOldError := ErrorBlock( {|oError| Break( oError ) } )

      BEGIN SEQUENCE

      ErrorBlock( bOldError )

I haven't had time to look at the gtwin.c code yet, but it does look
like changing the above line to read as follows should fix the problem.

else if( ch < 0 && ch != -32 && ch != -16)

I can't say that I fully understand the issue being discussed so I might be
missing something here. But, on the surface, it strikes me that this isn't
an issue for the FAQ but is an issue for the documentation.

BTW, Patrick, I keep asking about the languages fixes I submitted for the
3rd party web page on the harbour site but I've not seen a reply from you.
Any chance of us fixing this once and for all?

Patrick & Dave:

  I'd say we definitely need to get it into the docs, but if we expect
  people to ask about it on one of the lists because they don't find
  it in the docs, that's what an FAQ is for.
  I won't have time to work on docs for a while, but I'll clip it and
  save it in a file I have for later.

  The issue is: by default Harbour won't let you access an ivar named
  "class"--you need to add some #defines for MyObj:class to work.

No, that isn't what the FAQ is for. The FAQ isn't a document where someone
writes missing documentation, it's a document that points people to the
answers to frequently asked questions. If this question is being frequently
asked (and I can't see that it is anyway, not with any real frequency) then
this demonstrates that the documentation is lacking, not that the FAQ is
lacking.

Dear Friends

I´ve already finish to successfully convert an Clipper .RMK file to the
HbMake format.
My tests show that the conversion is ok that the hbmake process normaly the
converted file.

Before releasing the changes to the public, I need an Clipper RMK file that
use FWH and C4W

I'm not able to witness your problem with DJGPP GCC.

I would recommend that you check if your code executes

1. hb_macroGetType()
2. hb_macroCheckParam()
3. hb_errRT_BASE_Subst()

It will be great help if we know, in which of the above it dies.

Can I strongly suggest that if you find problems like this (what you write
suggests you've found others) that you don't simply work around them but,
instead, report them to the harbour developers? Harbour is still under
development and bugs are to be expected, people are invited to use harbour
on the understanding that they'll report problems that they find because
this helps the developers to find bugs and, accordingly, it helps to make
harbour even better.

IOW, in this case, symlinks might be your friend but a report of the bug to
the developers will make you everyone else's friend.

So, if you've got the time, the rest of those "amusing" problems might be
worth publishing.

> 	List Next 14 &MFIELDLST

I think you'll find that the heart of your problem is the fact that this
kind of thing isn't supported by CA-Clipper and harbour is a CA-Clipper
clone.

If I'm to understand your report it can be reproduced in this self-contained
program:

,----[ foo.prg ]
| Function Main()
| Local n
| Local cFields :=3D "One, Two"
|=20
|    If file( "foo.dbf" )
|       ferase( "foo.dbf" )
|    EndIf
|=20
|    dbcreate( "foo", { { "ONE", "C", 10, 0 },;
|                       { "TWO", "C", 10, 0 } } )
|=20
|    Use foo New Exclusive
|=20
|    For n :=3D 1 To 20
|       dbappend()
|       Foo->One :=3D str( n )
|       Foo->Two :=3D str( n * 10 )
|    Next
|=20
|    dbgotop()
|=20
|    List Next 10 &cFields
|=20
| Return( NIL )
`----

If I compile that with CA-Clipper and run it I get:

As you can see, with CA-Clipper you don't even get a runtime error, you
simply get an internal error.

This comes down to fundamental differences in Clipper type tools and
Fox/dBase kind of tools. The likes of Fox and dBase allowed you to macro
compile so much more, whole command lines in many cases. In Clipper (and, in
harbour) commands don't exist beyond compilation.

If you turn on the creation of PPO files (either in CA-Clipper or in
harbour) you'll see this. The LIST command gets turned into this:

,----
|  __dbList(.F.,{ {||&cFields} },.t.,,,10,,.F.,.F.,)
`----

before compilation takes place.

I'm surprised to hear that it does work on FlagShip. Anyway, as for working
in harbour, my advice would be re-work the solution so that LIST isn't used
at all. You can code up a function to replace the use of LIST with very
little effort, it could then take an array of fields to display.

For example, a quick and dirty version of my example program with such a
list routine.

,----[ foo.prg ]
| Function Main()
| Local n
|=20
|    If file( "foo.dbf" )
|       ferase( "foo.dbf" )
|    EndIf
|=20
|    dbcreate( "foo", { { "ONE", "C", 10, 0 },;
|                       { "TWO", "C", 10, 0 } } )
|=20
|    Use foo New Exclusive
|=20
|    For n :=3D 1 To 20
|       dbappend()
|       Foo->One :=3D str( n )
|       Foo->Two :=3D str( n * 10 )
|    Next
|=20
|    dbgotop()
|=20
|    MyListFunction( { {|| One }, {|| Two } } )
|=20
| Return( NIL )
|=20
| /////
|=20
| Function MyListFunction( aFields )
|=20
|    Do While !eof()
|       aeval( aFields, {|b| qqout( eval( b ) ) } )
|       qout( "" )
|       dbskip()
|    EndDo
|=20
| Return( NIL )
`----

Adding the extra functionality of LIST would be trivial.

[I've sent a CC: of this to the developers list so anyone interested can
 address the filename case with DO issue and also so the macro compiler
 authors and/or the author of LIST can have a think about how and why
 FlagShip allows you to do what you're doing despite the fact that it's not
 something that's allowed in CA-Clipper]

The DO issue is far trickier than appears at first. The parameter to DO is
an IDENTIFIER (symbol). Since all Clipper/Harbour Identifiers are *not* case
sensitive, all identifiers are converted to UPPERCASE, in compile time.

To resolve this issue, Lexer (currently NOT even case sensitive) will need
to save original (case sensitive) form of all identifiers, compiler will
have to request the original form of last identifier, when encountering a DO
parameter, and register this original form when calling hb_compAutoOpenAdd()

This is not impossible, but seem fairly expensive, especially considering
this "style" of programming is far from being popular, or necessary.

The SET PROCEDURE TO ... *is* case sensitive, because the argument is a
LITERAL (enclosed in quotes) and thus case is being preserved.

On the surface, I do *not* see any reason a macro expression can NOT be a
comma separated list. If macro compiler was modified to support lists, then
LIST, SET INDEX TO, etc. could be used with such macros of lists. (Ryszard?)

How would you measure this popularity? My impression is that it is *very*
popular if you think in terms of code that exists and might be ported to
case sensitive environments. I'd agree that it's no longer a popular method
of writing code in Clipper (thank ${DEITY}) but I suggest that you're
underestimating the amount of code that exists and could be compiled with
harbour that does use DO (you'll note, for example, that this issue was
raised because someone was porting a "legacy" system from a SCO to
GNU/Linux, porting of "legacy" systems would seem to be one of the main uses
for something like harbour).

I think it's definitely a bug that needs to be addressed at some point.
While it exists it does mean that harbour doesn't work "cross platform" in
all situations.

I suppose a not-so-elegant-a-solution-as-you-propose-hack would be, if a
file doesn't exist, try a lowercase version of it (but only when following a
DO). Would that suffice in the mean time?

No, I'm also using ini files at least because they are also working 
from a network install where using the (workstation) registry will 
force the user to install on each workstation :-(((

And Yes, I really think Xml could be a very good multiplatform 
replacement here.

	Yes, this is my intent to do so.  Actually, while I'm NOT a
database guru (barely a novice, unfortunately), porting and troubleshooting
code ARE primary aspects of my profession and my expertise.  I'm on the
Samba development team and I'm the maintainer for a device driver in the
Linux kernel (the Computone Serial board), as well as a security researcher
in my "day job".  So, as opportunity arises, I hope I might even supply
a few fixes to go along with the bug-bitches^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hreports.

	I've definitely found other things that don't work and, no doubt,
I'll find more (I'm seeing a STRANGE problem with some private variables
that are making me think that they are not quite so "private" - more on
that in a future message when I know more).  Fortunately, I had already
ported the thing to compile under FlagShip (quite some time ago - never
got it clean enough to put in production, though - lots of screen formating
problems), so a lot of compatibility issue from FoxPlus (which is REALLY
old) have been covered.

	This is a fairly abitious project.  The package I'm trying to
port comprises something over 14,000 lines of code that builds into
three executables.  The current databases take up close to 100 Meg
for the databases and indexes.  Just reindexing the databases takes
close to a half an hour.  A small, non-profit, fine arts school runs
their class registraton database on this beast and their ancient SCO system
is becoming unstable (impending drive failure, I think) and unmaintainable
(I don't even think I can still read the old QIC-60 install tapes for
the OS any more).

	Needless to say, I'm pleased that it compiled fairly quickly
and most of the work I had to do to get it to compile under Harbour
was to modify my "#ifdefs" to make sure the harbour builds went the
same ways as the FlagShip builds.  Other than a problem with setting
up the printer (below), the changes needed to port this code to FlagShip
appear to have been correct for Harbour.  Not surprising on that
point at all.

	I realize that Harbour is at 0.37 and bugs are to be expect.
I really have no problem with that and hope I can contribute back to
the project.  I'm impressed with how far I've gotten now, with only
a couple of days into the effort.

	Oh, I agree...  There also seem to be a lot of other case sensitivity
issues that I didn't run into on FoxPlus or FlagShip.  I found that the
database and index files in Harbour are also case sensitive.  The program
(which is over 12 years old at this point - no, I didn't write it.  :-) )
was written very sloppy with various case in various locations.  FoxPlus,
FlagShip, and Harbour all seem to map all vaiables to uppercase.
FoxPlus and FlagShip seem to also map all external file names to all
lower case, regardless of the case in the program.  That could be
".fmt" files, ".fox" files (the FoxPlus compiled files), the ".dbf"
files, or the ".idx" files.  All are created and accessed as absolute
lowercase.  Solves the case problem through brute force.  What's strange
is that Harbour seems to map "Do" calls to to uppercase and then applies a
lower case extension (REGPRINT.prg).  In the case of the "Set Procedure to"
operation, it left the file lower case.  The function calls in the "Do"
were all lower case and it ended up calling for uppercase file names with
lower case prg extensions.  It seems to leave the case of the file names
for database files and index files alone and does no mapping of them at
all, just appending a lower case extention to them.  I'm having to hunt
those problems down, one at a time, and fix the original code for the proper
case (which, IMHO, is a good thing anyways).

	IMHO...  I think both FoxPlus and FlagShip simply made an
arbitrary call to always map file names to lower case and probably
do so at some common "file open" API point rather than worry about
it in various functions.  But that's just a guess at their internals
based on my observations and experience and how I would have hacked
it together if I was doing it.

	I also seem to be running into some case sensitivity problems in
field names (at least that's what I THINK is happening - I'm debugging
that problem right now) in some fill-in forms.  I'll know more about
that later...

	Here are some of the things that are definitely not working the
way they work in FoxPlus or FlagShip...

--
	"Get ... Picture" problem with @Z in the picture.  According to
my FoxPro manual, @Z indicates the field is to be blank if the value is
zero.  So Picture "@Z 9999" with a variable initially containing zero
should give me a blank field into which I can type a 4 digit number.
This is what happens under FoxPlus and FlagShip.  Under Harbour, it's
a blank field but it accepts no input and I can't type anything into it.
If I take out the @Z and just have "9999" I have a field with a zero
initially and I can type my number just fine.  This would definitely
be a bug, since it simply doesn't work at all.

--
	Printing boxes (Ex: "@  1,  2  TO 16, 78    DOUBLE") seems to
have a problem.  Under FoxPlus and FlagShip, the box "surrounds" what
ever is on the display.  Under Harbour, the area with the box is
erased.  OF COURSE, the way THIS program was written was that output
was sent to the screen and THEN they drew the boxes around the items. :-(
Just meant that I had to go back in and reverse that by drawing the
boxes first and then outputing the data.  Not too bad, but I've got
at least one case were that ends up screwing up the box (left and right
side are broken lines instead of solid, with the lines missing on the
lines were I wrote data) that I haven't figured out yet.  Not sure if
this is a bug or where the bug is (problem in ncurses maybe?).

--
	Another "Picture" problem (maybe).  I have a fill-in form
with a phone number field.  This is how that is laid out:

@ 17, 13  SAY "Home Ph :"
@ 17, 23  GET  PERSON->H_PHONE  PICTURE "(999) 999-9999"

	The initial "PERSON->H_PHONE" contains a phone number and I
don't want to change it.  It shows up correct initially (something
like "(404) 555-1212").  When I simply hit enter on that field without
making any changes, the field changes to "(   )   - 404".  It's like
it took the first number picture (the area code) as the sole numeric
field and set the variable to it.  I would hate to have to bust all
the phone numbers into three number fields, but that's about the only
workaround I can think of.

--
	Missing (or at least I can't find it) a function for creating a
temporary file name.  Under FoxPlus this was "sys(3)".  Under FlagShip,
this was "TempFileName()".  Can't find an equivalent under Harbour, so
I had to fake one up (a fixed name with the user's "ID" appended).

	This is the code I ended up with working around the tempfile
problem:

#ifdef  FlagShip
              Store TempFileName() to MDATABASE
#else 
#ifdef  __HARBOUR__
              Store "mdatabase"+MUSERID to MDATABASE
#else 
              Store Sys(3) to MDATABASE
#endif
#endif

--
	"Browse" seems to work different between the three packages.
FoxPlus just uses the function "browse" and you are dumped into a
database browser where you can edit the database, including modifying
the data and adding entries.  Both FlagShip and Harbour require
parameters as a function.  In FlagShip, I can edit and change the
database I'm browsing.  Harbour doesn't seem to let me make changes
I may have a parameter set wrong or something here, but it's set up
the same way as FlagShip.  This is my browse command:

	Browse ( 1, 0, MaxRow(), MaxCol(), NIL, .F.)

	I don't recall what the "NIL" and the ".F." parameters do.
I got it from the FlagShip information somewhere...

--
	Setting the printer is a curious compatibility issue
between FoxPlus and FlagShip.  In order to pipe the printer data to
the lp command in FlagShip, I have to use:

	Set Printer to Pipe "lp"

	FoxPlus, I just use:

	Set Printer to "lp"

	The examples for Harbour make me think that the latter will result
in the output going to a file "lp" and the former generates a syntax
error.  This isn't necessarily a bug, but how to you send the printer
output to a command, especially a command with parameters (for selecting
the printer)?

FoxPlus and FlagShip but not part of the xBase Clipper.

	Yeah, I ran into more than a few of them in porting to FlagShip.
Just an indirect macro goes squash...

	This works under FoxPlus but not under FlagShip (and I didn't even
try it under Harbour):

	Hey!  Suggestions are really very much appreciated.  I was
dreading trying to work through the problems I was having with FlagShip
because I could find zero support or feedback.  Harbour looks really
good and this level of communication, alone, makes it head and shoulders
above FlagShip.  Anything I can do to help troubleshoot or test things,
just let me know.  I'll post successes and failures and fixes as I
go along.

	I'm now confirming this.  FoxPlus and FlagShip all dealt with
field names case insensitive.  Harbour is behaving case sensitive on
field names.  These databases were all created with field names in all
uppercase.  Now I'm finding spots in the .prg files where the fields
are referenced in mixed case (MExpire instead of MEXPIRE) and I get
a fieldname error at run time.  I'm now normalizing all those field
names in the program files to uppercase...  Sigh...

This sounds like an application for the "dynamic classes" feature of 
Harbour. You could read an xml file into a "TXMLFile" class, and it would 
dynamically add members depending on the structure of the file. Any tag 
within the file which only contained data would be a string member, and 
any tag which contained other tags would become an instance of the same 
class (except obviously with all its own members).

Did that make sense at all?

Pehaps the Mr. Littlefield,Stan Can help on.
Most of his post to the local.fivewin.harbour or related to XML/OLE DB.

It worth try to contact him.

Do you have a self-contained example of this? The reason I ask is that the
example program I posted was a good example of "mixed" case for creating and
accessing field names and it doesn't throw an error.

Here's a cut-down version of what I had in mind:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
#include "dbstruct.ch"

Function Main()

   If file( "foo.dbf" )
      ferase( "foo.dbf" )
   EndIf

   dbcreate( "foo", { { "UPPER", "C", 10, 0 },;
                      { "lower", "C", 10, 0 },;
                      { "Mixed", "C", 10, 0 } } )

   Use foo New Exclusive

   Append Blank

   Foo->UPPER := "Worked"
   Foo->upper := "Worked"
   Foo->Upper := "Worked"
   Foo->LOWER := "Worked"
   Foo->lower := "Worked"
   Foo->Lower := "Worked"
   Foo->MIXED := "Worked"

This works fine which would suggest that field names aren't being handled
case sensitive (which they shouldn't be). Perhaps it's an RDD issue? Are you
playing with a different RDD or something?

Don't "sigh", if something can be done to find the problem then it can be
fixed and you won't need to make those changes to your code.

This only seems to contain an executable. Will you be making source
available so that people can use it on other platforms?

I just added this capability to Harbour. Here is a small sample:

//------------------------//
Procedure Main()

   LOCAL cMacro := "1,2,3"

   ? &cMacro

RETURN
//------------------------//

The above will cause a R/T Error in Clipper, but now works in Harbour.

If you'll check the BROWSE() documentation in doc/en/browse.txt
you would see that Harbour (and CA-Clipper) version of BROWSE()
accept only 4 parameters BROWSE( [nTop, nLeft, nBottom, nRight] )

If I remember right, Harbour implementation of BROWSE() is based
on the TBrowse class and contain only the browse options but missing
the edit capabilities.

The FoxBase+ 2.00 dialect of the xBase language accept the following
syntax for the BROWSE command:

  BROWSE [FIELDS<list>] [LOCK<expr>] [FREEZE <field>]
         [NOFOLLOW] [NOMENU] [NOAPPEND] [WIDTH <expr>] [NOMODIFY]

I've forwarded a copy of this to Michael. Thanks for being so responsive on
this aspect of his feedback.

Is there any chance of you looking at the filename case issue or should we
add it to the long-term bug list?

Sadly it dies inside stack management again!!!

Did someone change stack code?

:-((((

This is not the error inside type(0) which I was experiencing the other day.

Now (with latest code) everything is BROKEN.

I've recompiled a little utility of mine which uses TFileRead and it dies as soon
as it starts (inside hb_StackNewFrame()).

:-(

regards.

Subject: [Harbour] latest cvs code breaks even win32 code?
Message-ID: <3B52B08B.2080907@libero.it>

Guys,

trying to reproduce my error on win32 I've updated my repository on my 
Win2K computer and I've tryed to compile a little test.prg using hbmake 
and an already available .mk file (a makefile generated by hbmake).

hbmake dies with this error:


E:\harbour>\repository\harbour\bin\hbmake test.mk

If I simply call hbmake I get an unrecoverable error:



E:\harbour>\repository\harbour\bin\hbmake

          Note: /p and /D can be used together
          Options with + are the default Value
          -D switch can accept multiple macros in the same line
          or use one macro per -D switch
Unrecoverable error 9010: hb_xfree called with an invalid pointer

So it seems there are problems even on win32.

regards.


PS. The same error gets thrown from hbmake on OS/2. But I can call 
harbour.exe (OS/2 and win32) without parameters and it shows its usage 
without problems .

Please re-test this again, I just added the above capability to Harbour.
Both <comma separated lists> and <full commands> should now be supported.

*** Please note that an EXTERN declaration *might* be needed incase your
code does not explicitly reference functions implied by such macro
expansion.

Here is a sample:

//--------------------------------//
EXTERN SET

PROCEDURE Main()

   LOCAL cMacroCmd := "SET PRINTER TO LP"

   &cMacroCmd

Sorry, I will not be able to address this issue, at least not in the short
term.

Ok, I've added it to the bug list (bug ID 441660). I also added some other
lang standing bugs this morning, all of which, I think, affect stuff that
you're "responsible" for. They're outstanding -W3 problems.

Another problem I forsee with adding this sort of macro expansion support is
people's own commands. I can see people getting confused by this.

 Ron,

RP>    * source/vm/macro.c
RP>      + Added preprocessing support to hb_macroGetValue()

 I'm strongly against this change. If someone wants to have
 preprocessing support, he can have it with __Preprocess().

 For others this leads to increasing of the exe file ( + ~40Kb ),
 increasing of a memory required and to significant speed decreasing
 of the macro operations. Now for executing every macro string the
 program will scan and process the whole pp table !

I strongly suspect that *anyone* capable of creating their own commands,
does *not* use this "style" of coding, and/or does  *not* use this style
with user-defined command, and/or does *not* get confused by what should be
obvious to such individual.

Regardless, I hope those contributing to Harbour Documentation, will take
notice of your point.

Would you suggest enclosing it in an #ifdef HB_MACRO_STATEMENTS or the like
?

I personally don't mind it either way, but it could be an important point
for those coming to Harbour from other xBase dialects. It also appears to me
that the speed impact is generally unnoticeable, and 40k size impact on 32
bit environment seems trivial.

More input...

Ron, Alexander,

I also agree that when a programmer wants to run a preprocessed macro,
he simple needs to use the __Preprocess() function, or even better, use
the TPreProcessor class.

So, actualy, we already have this functionality.
//--------------------------------//
EXTERN SET

PROCEDURE Main()

   LOCAL cMacroCmd := "SET PRINTER TO LPT1"
   LOCAL oPreprocess := TPreProcessor():New()

   cMacroCmd := oPreprocess:TranslateLine(cMacroCmd)
   oPreprocess:End()

   &cMacroCmd

RETURN
//--------------------------------//

. o O (But than, if we have the #ifdef HB_MACRO_STATEMENTS, we can have
the best of both worlds.)

 Harbour libs.

 They can use

   &( __Preprocess( cMacro ) ),

 if they need it. They will know, that using of __Preprocess() demands
 more resources and slow execution and they will have a freedom to
 choice, to use or not to use it, and if to use - in what places.

  Only in your sample with SET PRINTER.
  But what if a macro is executed in a cycle ?

  50K, I just checked it. + 9-10% of the program size for unused
  feature ...
  And in the RAM, I think, there is more space added.

Ron,

>>impact on 32 bit environment seems trivial.

You did not think the same way when you include simplex on Harbour. The only
benefit of Simplex is that the EXE file was 30kb smaller than the one
created with Lex.

>>I personally don't mind it either way, but it could be an

People are not usually stupid as you may think, BUT not advanced users
usually do not know the technique of converting macro to code-blocks and
then only evaluate the code-block, they normally evaluate the same macro
constantly, so the penalty of preprocessing will be terrible.

I highly disapprove your modification. Please reverse the original code or
lets vote ASAP.

BTW, the preprocessor engine of Alexander if by far better than your (is
written in C), so in any case it will be the one to include.

Note: Sorry if you feel I am litle bit rude.

It seems something corrupted memory since it dies inside memcpy()
because of (I think) an invalid pointer.

As I suggested to Antonio, given that this is part of the RTL I think this
function's name should be placed in the "harbour namespace". Perhaps
something like HB_Profiler() would be a better name?

I also note in the code that there's a couple of calls to ALERT(). Given
that this is a RTL function I'd have thought that it would be much better to

Subject: [Harbour] Can't have multiple classes in one source file?
Message-ID: <20010716165529.L25750@hagbard.davep.org>

Consider this source:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
#include "hbclass.ch"

Function Main()

   Happy():greeting()
   
Return( NIL )

Create Class Happy

   Method greeting
   
End Class

Create Class Sad

   Method greeting

End Class

Method greeting Class Happy

   ? "Hello, World!"
   
Return( self )

Method greeting Class Sad

   ? "Goodbye, cruel world!"

Return( self )
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

Two classes with the same interface being declared and implemented in one
source file. It's my understanding that this should work fine, hence the
support for naming a class when implementing a method.

However, it won't compile:

,----
| davep@hagbard:~/temp$ gharbour foo -n -p
| Harbour Compiler 0.37a (Build 37) (2001.06.29) (Flex)
| Copyright 1999-2001, http://www.harbour-project.org/
| Compiling 'foo.prg' and generating preprocessed output to 'foo.ppo'...
| foo.prg(27) Error F0002  Redefinition of procedure or function: 'SAD_GREETING'
`----

For some reason it takes the first method (which should belong to the Happy
class) as a method for the second class.

I'm sure this wasn't a problem a few weeks back.

Hi Dave

Yes, I seen that this WE :-((( It was working some month ago for 
sure. In the meantime, you can simply change the order of your 
code. 

Like this ;


Class Definition 1
Endclass

Method XXX class 1

Method YYY class 1

Class Definition 2
Endclass

Method XXX Class 2

Method YYY Class 2


See you,

  I would much prefer such an extension be inside a #define so we can

If one can include the SAME features for LESS exe size, it is ALWAYS
desirable. It is trivial when MORE features increase the exe size. BTW, size
is only one of many benefits SimpLex build has over Flex, but I doubt I
can/want to convince you of that.

I never suggested users to be stupid. This has to do with compatibility with
other popular xBase dialects, it has nothing to do with knowledge, or
intelligent levels.

I just #ifdefed it out. As you should know, this feature has no impact on my
needs. I do not think I'll ever #define this myself.

Did you mean faster, or better - do you know of *any* bug in pp.prg? BTW,
this feature was *not* using ANYTHING from my pp. If you only read ChangeLog
entries, you wouldn't need to speculate.

Why would I think that?

You'll have to #define HB_MACRO_STATEMENTS when building Harbour, to enable
the <full command> support. It is disabled by default for size/performance
issues.

RDD developers, I'm attaching a PRG test program that has proven very
usefull to test key access and other file movements in various & limit
conditions. I consits on a PRG, a DBF file and the Output generated. Of this
last one, I include the one generated by Clipper with NTX. Comparing the
output of the PRG with this file can be used to spot errors on the RDD. The
bad news is that neither the Hrbour NTX nor the CDX pass this test.... I
hope this program helps to get this two RDDs to it's final completion. I'm
affraid that Harbour itself cannot go 1.0 without them, or am I wrong?

Regards
Harrier

100% agree, which is why I didn't #ifdef it originally.

This was never the issue, as you know compatibility does not equal "work
around". If the person that needs this person knew of __PreProcess() and the
Clipper pre-processor in general, he would likely use function level code to
begin with!

I understand and agree that this is an important concern. It forces us back
to the #ifdef issue.

Since most of the active Harbour users so far, do not appear to require this
feature, I #if defined it out.

No, you are not wrong. Harbour needs working NTX and CDX before going to 1.0.

Subject: [Harbour] Harbour equivalent of Class(y)'s :isKindOf()?
Message-ID: <20010716182914.N25750@hagbard.davep.org>

Does harbour's class system have an equivalent of Class(y)'s :isKindOf()
standard method?

For those who don't know what it is, it's a method of testing if an object
is an instance of a given class:

,----
| ? oObject:isKindOf( SomeClass() )
`----

Related to this, I'd have thought that this code:

,----
| #include "hbclass.ch"
| 
| Function Main()
| 
|    ? Happy():new():class == Happy()
|    
| Return( NIL )
| 
| Create Class Happy
| End Class
`----

would have printed .T. but it prints .F.. Isn't this a reliable method of
testing the class of an object in harbour?

Dave,

  You can use __objHasdata() __objHasMethod()

Correct me if I'm wrong but they tell me if a given object has a instance
variable or a method of a given name. That's not the same of testing for the
class of an object.

How would they help test the class of an object?

Sorry, but it appears both you and J.F. are mistaken. I found the problem,
and it clearly suggests that this kind of structure (where the class
definition does *not* immediately follow its declaration), could not work
for the last few months, since we added the compile time integrity checking
of class syntax.

I'm now checking to see if we could support all existing features with this
kind of structure, or this might need to be a documented limitation. That is
multiple classes can be defined as long as each *complete* class
implementation is *continues*.

Subject: [Harbour] A modular/OO approach to profile reporting?
Message-ID: <20010716214648.R25750@hagbard.davep.org>

--1SQmhf2mF2YjsYvc
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline

I've been thinking about the profile reporting stuff over the past few days
and Patrick's changes to the current profile reporting got me thinking some
more. I've been wondering about a modular/OO approach to the profile
reporter and I was wondering if anyone thought it might be a good idea.

My thinking was that, to start with, something that writes profile data to a
file might be a good idea (which is what we've got now) but also that access
to a formatted array would be useful for building browsers in the debugger.
Rather than just using arrays of strings or arrays of arrays I was wondering
if using arrays of objects would make more sense (it makes the code more
readable if nothing else).

So, anyway, attached is a little experiment I've just been doing. I *don't*
offer it as code to compete with Antonio and Patrick's work but I do offer
it as an example of the sort of thing I had in mind.

I'm not totally happy with the design, there's some things I'd change before
placing it in CVS (if, indeed, anyone thought it was useful), but it should
give some clue as to where I was heading with this.

What it does do is provide OO building blocks so the likes of Antonio and
Patrick's code can be written while, at the same time, making the code
openly available to harbour hackers so they can write their own profile
reporting add-ons.

Example use:

// Report on calls greater than 0
HB_ProfileReportToFile():new():gather():callSort():generate( {|o| o:nCalls > 0 } )

// Get an array of of everything.
a := HB_ProfileReportToArray():new():gather():callSort():generate()

// Get an array of the above, but sorted by time:
a := HB_ProfileReportToArray():new():gather():timeSort():generate()

// As above, but get a string:
c := HB_ProfileReportToString():new():gather():timeSort():generate()

[In case anyone is wondering, the "Protected:" scope specifiers are
 commented out because scoping is causing me some problems and I'm not sure
 of the current state of scoping]

So I'm not mistaken, it did work at some point in the past?

Subject: [Harbour] Unrecoverable error 9014: Unsupported VM opcode
Message-ID: <20010716170209.E14491@alcove.wittsend.com>

Got a strange problem...

	One particular menu in the package I'm working on has a very
strange problem (or set of problems).  Within it I have some private
variables containing the title and menu items I paint the display with.
When I first tried Harbour out, I could enter and exit that menu, but
the menu on the display would remain that of the submenu.  If I went to
a different menu, and got that display, returning to the main menu
would result in the original wrong menu (the first submenu), almost like
the private variables had been overwritten (yes, they were the same name
between the modules).

	But it gets better.  Sometimes the problem "goes away" with a
recompile.  Then the menus look right and I can move back and forth and
have the correct screen displays.  All this was very spooky anyways but
then I also started having it blow up with this:

Unrecoverable error 9014: Unsupported VM opcode
Called from MAIN(192)

	Line 192 is the call to the submenu function (fortunately a little
used maintenance submenu).  The error occurs returning out of that menu
back to the main menu.  If I enter a function under that (there are several
that menu that browses one of the database, exiting the browse takes me
out of that menu and all the way back to main, like it was prematurely
exiting a loop like this:


Store " " to OPTION

Do While OPTION <> "Q"
   Clear
   Do DrawMenu with MTITLE,MNUMBER,MLENGTH,MCHOICES
   Store " " to OPTION
   Do Center with 21,"<R>eindex  <L>oad  <B>rowse  <S>ecurity  <Q>uit"
   Do Center with 22,"<I>ndex    <D>ump  <P>urge   <A>ccount   <Z>ap "
   Do Center with 23,"Please make your choice..."
   @ 23, 78 Get OPTION Picture "!"
   Read
   @ 21, 0 Clear to 23, 78
   Do Case
	:
	: - Over 1500 lines of code in between...
	:
   EndCase
EndDo
Store " " to OPTION
Return

	Nothing sets "OPTION" to Q, and there are no "Returns" in the body
of the loop, but I'm generally dumped all the way back to the main menu
(calling function) or I get bombed out with the VM error.

	As it so happens, this is probably the largest single "function"
in the entire package at over 1500 lines (over 11% of the total package)
for the one, single procedure, file.  Is it possible that there is a problem
with proceedures this large?  (If so, I can break it up into a pile of
little ones....)

	One last thing...  It stays consistant for a given compile and edit.
If I rerun the app, it does the same thing each time unless I edit the
source files and make changes (just recompiling has no effect).  If I
make changes, it's then a new crap shoot what it's going to do.

	I know this is real vague.  Anyone got some suggestions for
troubleshooting it further so I can get you some decent feedback?

	Mike

Message-ID: <20010716220304.V25750@hagbard.davep.org>

While playing with the profile reporting stuff one thing I've noticed is
that the times that are being record on my GNU/Linux box look for from
correct. For example:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
davep@hagbard:~/develop/harbour/profiler$ head hbprof.txt

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

Look at the ticks/seconds values. I'm sure you'll believe me when I say that
the test program didn't spend sixty seconds inside the CREATE method (mental
note: *which* create method).

Have I missed the point of the data that's returned back from the profiling
functions or am I looking at a problem with recording times, on GNU/Linux,
using whatever method harbour currently uses.

I recall some discussion about what to use early on but without a search
facility on the archives (did anything happen in that regard Phil?) I'm
unclear as to what was finally decided upon and how it was used.

I've searched all the docs but can't find anything that documents the
profiler design. So, I was wondering, is anyone in the position to give a
brief rundown of how this all fits together and where I should be looking if
I'm to try and get sensible values on GNU/Linux?

Ahh, err, yeah, I guess so. The only OO add-ons I've ever used for Clipper
were SuperClass and then Class(y) so I guess the code is Class(y)-a-like.

T'is nice that harbour allows for this.

I'm working on the :Class problem, as on all Class Method 
(including 'InitClass'). But it could required a major split in the class 
system.

I can't have it working keeping FW object compatibility. (Where 
Self:Class can be used as any message name and where Class 
Var are directly available as object message, without prefixing it by 
the message Self:Class:...

Unfortunatly, (as most of the Class(y) programmers I think) I 
absolutly need :Class to work with the class method ...

No, I did *not* say that. I said it could *not* have worked *at least* since
we added compile time integrity checking, or May-08-2001 to be exact.

I did not test that before, so I can't speculate regarding its functionality
any time prior to that.

Ta, that's the sort of thing I was looking for.

So what is self:class at the moment? It's available so it would seem that
it's currently a problem for "FW object" types.

Yes, if I was ever to port any of my code to harbour I'd need this, and
more.

I'm wondering if much of this can simply be done by having a "Class(y) super
class" that base classes would inherit from. Note that I'm wondering that
from a position of ignorance in regard to how the class system in harbour is
implemented.

Actually Self:Class ==> Self
This allow a classy User to Have a CLASS VAR Test and use it as 
Self:Class:Test where a FWO user would use it as Self:Test.

If a FW user want to use the Message Class it have to disable the 
Classy compatibility as Brian had to do some days ago.

I was thinking at something like this but I'm afraid we would have to 
keep a more simple OO system as the Base class system and 
allow a better compatibility with class(y) by the inclusion of a new 
hbCSY.ch and one specific lib to link.

Any idea or comment welcome.

	It's really looking more like it's the size of that individual
procedure.  I tool a 250 line "Case" condition and broke it out into
it's own little procedure, and the problems seem to have gone away.
I may do that with a few more of the larger selections in that module...

At least, we could disable it by using NO_OO_ERR but it seem to 
not work. To have it working  I had also to change the line 574 ;

#xcommand METHOD <MethodName> CLASS <ClassName> => 
METHOD <MethodName> DECLCLASS  <ClassName> 
_CLASS_IMPLEMENTATION_

to 

#xcommand METHOD <MethodName> CLASS <ClassName> => 
METHOD <MethodName> CLASS  <ClassName> 
_CLASS_IMPLEMENTATION_
 
Could you have a look ? PP is really not my 'cup of tea' ;-)))

PS: It could be better to change NO_OO_ERR to 
HB_CLS_NO_OO_ERR like the other Class related #define, isn't it 
?

Patrick,
you should update tests/testprof.prg to the new syntax and add some
tests for the new paremeters of HB_Profiler().

Hi,
these are some bugs I found yesterday:

1) tests/vec1.prg gives a parse error (again),

2) tstdbi.prg throws an "Operation not supported" and one memory block
not released. Check also the dbi*.txt files generated for differences.

3) in tests/testdbf.prg, adding two empty memo files throws an error.
This happens with both NTX and CDX.

There the design is wrong is in having the report classes inherit from the
profile classes. It makes more sense to have a profile class that gathers
profile information and then have the report class hierarchy as something
that is separate and can be "fed" a profile snapshot.

So, with the attached, examples are:

// Take a snapshot, sort my call frequency.
Local o := HB_Profile():new():gather():callSort()

// Report on calls greater than 0
HB_ProfileReportToFile():new( o ):generate( {|o| o:nCalls > 0 } )

// Get an array of of everything.
a := HB_ProfileReportToArray():new( o ):generate()

// Get an array report of methods called more than 10 times
a := HB_ProfileReportToArray():new( o ):;
     generate( {|o| __objDerivedFrom( o, HB_ProfileMethod() ) .And.;
                    o:nClass > 10 } )

And so on. HB_ProfileReportToTBrowse() and the like could exist for browsing
of the data from within the debugger.

That's sort of what I was questioning, it seems you were speculating because
you said we were both mistaken. Now you're saying you can't be sure.

Could you please explain "again". The parse errors are on the TEXT ...
ENDTEXT block. This could have *never* worked as far as I can tell, because
TEXT ... ENDTEXT was never really implemented in pp!

Yes I know, but the compiler shows the first "parse error" in the first
QOut() not in TEXT...ENDTEXT block. This didn't happened the last time I
built Harbour.

Dave, Ron

I just changed one or two line within hbclass.ch to allow anyone to 
(really) disable the error checking, so allowing this kind of 
contruction. I just discovered I mostly used it within my source.

I also changed NO_OO_ERR to HB_CLS_NO_OO_ERR to be 
compatible with other Classes #defines.

I'm sure ;-))) it was working before the error checking otherwise 
most of my tests here would had failed.

My apologies, I should have said that reporting this problem was on my TODO
list.

Here's a method of reproducing the problem: Take the second version of
PROFREP.PRG that I've just posted, remove the comments before the PROTECTED:
declarations, make sure you compile it like:

,----
| harbour profrep -n -p -d__TEST__
`----

(it's the __TEST__ but that's important here, it ensures that the MAIN()
function is included) and link it up.

I get the following error when running it:

,----
| Error BASE/1004  Scope violation (protected 0): HB_PROFILEREPORT:HFILE
| Called from HB_PROFILEREPORT:HFILE(0)
| Called from __EVAL(377)

| Called from HB_PROFILEREPORT:GENERATE(350)
| Called from HB_PROFILEREPORT:GENERATE(389)

I'm guessing the problem is because things are being done from an AEVAL()
(presumably an EVAL() of any kind would have this problem) I'd hope that
scope is "bound" inside a codeblock. I've got a feeling Class(y) handles
this sort of thing but I could be wrong there as I've not tested this with
Class(y) yet.

I can get round it by changing this:

,----
| Method writeLines( aLines ) Class HB_ProfileReportToFile
| 
|    If ::hFile != F_ERROR
|       aeval( aLines, {|c| fwrite( ::hFile, c + HB_OsNewLine() ) } )
|    EndIf
| 
| Return( self )
`----

to this:

,----
| Method writeLines( aLines ) Class HB_ProfileReportToFile
| Local hFile := ::hFile
| 
|    If ::hFile != F_ERROR
|       aeval( aLines, {|c| fwrite( hFile, c + HB_OsNewLine() ) } )
|    EndIf
| 
| Return( self )
`----

but that feels inelegant.

Interestingly, I also get this when the application exits:

,----
| Total memory allocated: 103626 bytes (1628 blocks)
| WARNING! Memory allocated but not released: 2 bytes (1 blocks)
| fm.c:442: HB_TR_ERROR Block 1 (size 2) GENERATE(0)

I think loading what's passed to SET PRINTER makes more sense than adding
possibly platform specific keywords.

No I did not speculate. My original statement is a concise statement of
facts:

"I found the problem, and it clearly suggests that this kind of structure
(where the class definition does *not* immediately follow its declaration),
could not work for the last few months, since we added the compile time
integrity checking of class syntax."

It clearly states that your sample code could not have worked *for* *the*
*last* *few* *months* (and it qualifies the exact period with "since...". It
does not attempt to speculate anything, rather it states a simple fact.

The "Sorry, but it appears both you and J.F. are mistaken." is clearly
addressing your [wrong] impression that "I'm sure this wasn't a problem a
*few* *weeks* *back*." <emphasis added> and J.F.'s [wrong] confirmation of
your statement.

The first parse error I get is on line 13. This is *not* the first QOut()!
Here is the compiler output:

This is compiler specific (I'm not able to recreate it with BCC, MSVC or
even DJGPP)! I suspect it is not a memory corruption, but rather some
compiler related issue.

BTW, did you try without the block, simply Type( NIL )?

Patrick needs to add  something like this somewhere in the site.

<p>Search the Harbour Project Mailing Lists:

We may have to play with the restrict value to get proper filtering.

  Thanks for the test. I've checked it for Harbour's DbfNtx - all
  differences with Clipper are for SET DELETED ON state. I really
  missed it, currently DbfNtx doesn't check this flag.
  I'll look at it.

  Please remove this change or create a separate macroXXX.y file since 
this change breaks Clipper compatibility. Also it breaks the modularity 
of HVM since it relays now on some external code and adds some overhead 
to pcode execution.
Notice that with this change the following code will be not compatible 
with Clipper:

READ someVar
REPLACE someField WITH &someVar

Now when someone enters 2,34 instead of 2.34 this will be compiled 
correctly (istead of generation of a runtime error) and it will break the 
eval stack since there will be one additional not-popped item on it.

Subject: [Harbour] Profiling, turning on and off profile data capture
Message-ID: <20010717093507.J25750@hagbard.davep.org>

Is there a method of turning profile data capture on and off? It strikes me
that any code that acts as a profile gatherer and reporter should turn off
the profiler itself so as not to affect the figures but I can't obviously
see a method of doing this.

IIRC the Win32 console on Win9{5|8} gives terrible performance, could it be
that your speed test isn't testing harbour programs but is, instead, simply
testing the performance of the "console" of each environment?

Perhaps a less screen intensive test would be more meaningful?

This is my point of view. I already had some test (even not in 
harbour) where the windowed 32 bits console seem to have a real 
speed problem.

We may easily add a SetProfiler( On | Off ), but the
question is, should this function be appart from the
standard Set() function supported calls ?

I'd have thought that something this "internal" would be fine as a
__setProfiler() or HB_setProfiler() function. Profiling is something that's
separate from normal development GET/SET values isn't it?

It would appear that it doesn't, this:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
#include "hbclass.ch"

Function Main()

   ? __objDerivedFrom( Happy():new(), Happy() )

Return( NIL )

Create Class Happy
End Class
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

prints .F. when I'd expect .T..

 code)
Message-ID: <3B543A24.ADBC4FD3@libero.it>

Hi,

I think I've traced my problem with type(nil) killing harbour VM.

It could be an error of OS/2 GCC runtime, I think so because I have an
invalid pointer inside hb_errRT_BASE_SubstR() when it calls
hb_itemArrayPut() passing to it a var_arg() argument.

There is an old Changelog entry from David which says:

19990915-17:40 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>

  * include/itemapi.h
  * source/rtl/itemapi.c
    ! Added a third argument, PBH_ITEM pItemArg1, to the hb_itemDo()
      and hb_itemDoC() functions to solve a var-arg problem with the
      OS/2 version of GCC. When calling hb_itemDo() or hb_itemDoC() to
      evaluate a symbol, function, or code block that does not take
      any arguments, use '(PHB_ITEM *) 0' as the third argument.


I'd like to hear from him what he remembers of this error and, in the
meanwhile, I'll try to apply his workournd to errorapi.c to see if it
works.

regards.

<URL:http://www.davep.org/harbour/profrep.prg> has been updated again to add
some extra simple cases to the testing (and to enhance the HB_ProfileEntity
class).

I don't have a WinDos environment in which I can test harbour's profiler
and, as I reported elsewhere, on my GNU/Linux box I don't seem to be getting
anything close to sensible results when it comes to the time accounting side
of things.

Can anyone on WinDos (or OS/2 for that matter) confirm that the results from
the profiler look sensible when it comes to accounting for time?

Any feedback from the profiler team regarding this approach to profile

The problem is that the OS/2 version of GCC requires a null pointer to
properly terminate a vararg list.

This added parameter is not the last of the list (but only an added
parameter _before_ the list) but makes va_start() work as expected since it
is not promoted to a bigger type (while an USHORT is promoted to an ULONG).

This comes from va_xxx() help of EMX GCC (read restrictions):

   Headers:

  #include <stdarg.h>

  Prototypes:

  type va_arg (va_list arg_ptr, type);
  void va_end (va_list arg_ptr);
  void va_start (va_list arg_ptr, type prev_arg);

  Compatibility:

  C90

  Description:

  Access arguments of a function with variable number of arguments.  You
have to declare a variable of type va_list, for
  instance arg_ptr.  Use

      va_start (arg_ptr, prev_arg)

  where prev_arg is the argument preceding the variable arguments, to
initialize arg_ptr.  Use

      va_arg (arg_ptr, type)

  to get the next argument, which is of type type.  Use

      va_end (arg_ptr)

  when you no longer need arg_ptr.

  Return value:

  See above.

  Restrictions:

  prev_arg must not be declared register, must not be of function or array
type, and the type must be compatible to the   type that results from
promotion.  For instance, prev_arg must not be of type char or float.

  type must be compatible to the type that results from promotion.  For
instance, type must not be unsigned char or
  float (instead, use unsigned int and double, respectively).

  See also: vprintf()

  Example: See /emx/samples/stdarg.c



Now, my question is: can I change all USHORTs to ULONGs? I think I can do
it without any side-effect but I'd like to be assured about this.


regards.


PS. hb_itemDo() does have this workaround of an extra parameter, but I
think there are calls to it which don't consider this (like
\vm\macro.c:154) and are, because of this, wrong.

Uhmm,

I've looked around a bit with reguard to var_arg() macro use and I think
that using a USHORT as previous parameter to a ... (variable length
parameter) is WRONG at least on an ANSI C compiler.

In fact, changing hb_errRT_BASE_SubstR(,,,, USHORT uiArgCount) to an ULONG
fixed my problem!

And note that uiArgCount should be an UINT not a USHORT.

So, I'd like to hear from a C guru if I am correct or not and if I can
change all prototypes of functions which use a var_arg() macro from short
to long parameters.

regards.

It looks ok to me to use some classes

Why don't you CVS them ?

David,

I've changed all functions which have a va_start() from USHORT to ULONG and
I've rebuilt everything.

Now hbtest.prg works againg and so does my little test program.

I will upload these changes ASAP.

regards.

'cos there's already a profile reporter in the RTL and I'd only CVS it if
the authors of the existing code (yourself and Patrick) were happy to swap
to an OO approach.

As I said, I didn't write this to "compete" with the code you and Patrick
have written (I did it for fun more than anything, and to do a little more
"shakedown" work on harbour's class system) but if I were to commit it to
CVS while PROFILE.PRG existed it'd be unnecessary redundancy.

It still needs some polishing (there's a couple of TODO: items in there) but
it should serve to illustrate the profile reporting approach I had in mind.

I think it's a more elegant and modular approach than the current code but
I'm not sure if it's actually overkill.

Still, for personal amusement, overkill's fun. ;>

I have no problem giving up the current Profiler.prg for a better
replacement.
If your class is tested and can do all the current profiler can do,
please CVS it.

If it's better, it's better, no argument! ;-)

It is ok to me if you swap the current

You guys have a play and see what you think. If nobody else has any
objections to this approach I'll drop it into CVS as a replacement for
PROFILE.PRG in the next couple of days.

That said, I'd like us to get to the bottom of the other profiler issues
I've raised too. Time accounting on GNU/Linux doesn't seem to be working too
well and the OS/2/GCC/EMX sample that was just posted suggests that clock()
works different there as well.

We might want to look at a better and more portable method of accounting for
time.

I don't know what happened to the above but it's almost impossible to read.
But, if I'm reading it correctly, there's some interesting things going on
here. It would appear that your environment has around 100 ticks per second.
clock() on GNU/Linux claims to have 1000000:

,----
| CONFORMING TO
|        ANSI C.  POSIX requires that CLOCKS_PER_SEC equals 1000000
|        independent of the actual resolution.
`----

which is also different from the 1000 figure that Antonio seems to have
used.

Antonio, can you clarify this value?

Dave,

I haven't used it. Patrick asked me and I showed him the Borland docs:

-------
clock     <TIME.H>

Returns number of clock ticks since program start

Declaration

clock_t clock(void);

Remarks

clock can be used to determine the time interval between two events.

To determine the time in seconds, divide the value returned by clock by the
value of the macro CLK_TCK. (notice that clock.h #define CLK_TCK is 1000.0)

Return Value

On success, returns the processor time elapsed since the beginning of the
program invocation.

On failure (the processor time is not    available, or its value can't be
represented), returns -1.

Portability

DOS	UNIX	Windows	ANSI C	C++ only
yes		yes	yes

See Also

time

Example

clock example
-------

Besides that, there are other curious readings from the profiler
reports. A function/procedure/method may consume zero ticks (obviously
they consume some time, but not enough for a tick), but the funny thing
is that the sume of all those (almost) zero ticks is zero :-) Something
that we all know it is impossible.

If we could find a replacement for clock(), to get milliseconds
instead of clock ticks, that would be perfect.

Dear Friends

I was thinking to add native support for this CUA members.

I has this classes all derived from Get and works fine with Harbour.

Of this classes, Radio and Checkbox are used in hbmake.

If no one complain, i´ll add this files to the rtl directory

I think there's little doubt then that we need to find something better for
doing these measurements.

Anyone got any suggestions?

It half works in Class(y). As an example, this:

,----
| #include "class(y).ch"
| 
| Function Main()
| 
|    ? Foo():new():block()
| 
| Return( NIL )
|

| 
| End Class
| 
| Method init()
| 
|    ::cName := "davep"
| 
| Return( self )
| 
| Method block()
| Return( eval( {|| ::cName } ) )
`----

works in CA-Clipper with Class(y) but fails in harbour (prior to your
chance, I've yet to download, build and test it).

This:

,----[ foo.prg ]
| #include "class(y).ch"
| 
| Function Main()
| 
|    ? eval( Foo():new():block() )
| 
| Return( NIL )

| End Class
| 
| Method init()
| 
|    ::cName := "davep"
| 
| Return( self )
| 
| Method block()
| Return( {|| ::cName } )
`----

fails with both Class(y) and harbour.

Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't Clipper 5.3 make these kinds of things
available? Is your implementation of these things compatible with those in
5.3? I'd have said that if such things were to be added to the RTL they
should be added so as to provide CA-Clipper 5.3 compatibility.

Just built with the changes. This form of scope detachment still fails (it
defeats Class(y) too):

,----
| #include "hbclass.ch"
| 
| Function Main()
| 
|    ? eval( Foo():new():block() )
| 
| Return( NIL )
| 
| Create Class Foo
| 
|    Protected:
| 
|       Var cName
| 
|    Exported:
| 
|       Method init
|       Method block
| 
| End Class
| 
| Method init()
| 
|    ::cName := "davep"
| 
| Return( self )
| 
| Method block()
| Return( {|| ::cName } )
`----

Personally I think it should work. Given that codeblocks can be used to pass
"environments" around an application it's very tempting to think that, as
with detached locals, you'd get detached scope too.

Would that be possible? Can scope in a codeblock be decided based on where
the codeblock was created?

This form now works as expected (bringing harbor on par with Class(y)):

,----
| #include "hbclass.ch"
| 
| Function Main()
| 
|    ? Foo():new():block()
| 
| Return( NIL )
| 
| Create Class Foo
| 
|    Protected:
| 
|       Var cName
| 
|    Exported:
| 
|       Method init
|       Method block
| 
| End Class
| 
| Method init()
| 
|    ::cName := "davep"
| 
| Return( self )
| 
| Method block()
| Return( eval( {|| ::cName } ) )
`----

But, this fix seems to be defeated by inheritance:

,----
| #include "hbclass.ch"
| 
| Function Main()
| 
|    ? Bar():new():block()
| 
| Return( NIL )
| 
| Create Class Foo
| 
|    Protected:
| 
|       Var cName
| 
|    Exported:
| 
|       Method init
| 
| End Class
| 
| Method init() Class Foo
| 
|    ::cName := "davep"
| 
| Return( self )
| 
| Create Class Bar Inherit Foo
| 
|    Exported:
| 
|       Method block
| 
| End Class
| 
| Method block() Class Bar
| Return( eval( {|| ::cName } ) )
`----

fails with a scope violation error.

Just to be clear, is the code you're wanting to place in CVS code that
implements 5.3 compatible behaviour? If so I can't imagine that there would
be any significant objections.

What is the nature of the fix (I looked at the ChangeLog entry but couldn't
figure out what had been done to fix this and other possible instances of

I do not agree with you here. Using the codeBlock outside any 
allowed method (in the scoping point of view) must restrict the 
(mis)use of this protected var. 
 
> Would that be possible?

Humm, seem very difficult to implement as I would have to keep 
somewhere either the special status of this codeBlock (something 
like heriting the scoping propertie of the initial class) or the special 
status of the protected Var.

In all case, not my priority, even if the intellectual challenge seem

Great Job Maurilio,

I have the feeling your problem could be related to my GPF in place

Why must there be this restriction?

If you look at how codeblocks work, or, more to the point, what they
provide, scope binding is one of the features. Consider the binding of scope
of local and static variables. I can do this with a codeblock:

,----
| Function Main()
| Local aBlocks := MakeDetachedEnvironment()
| 
|    ? eval( aBlocks[ 1 ] )
|    eval( aBlocks[ 2 ], 23 )
|    ? eval( aBlocks[ 1 ] )
| 
| Return( NIL )
| 
| Function MakeDetachedEnvironment()
| Local n := 0
| Return( { {|| n }, {|i| n := i } } )
`----

MAIN() has no "right" to access the local (or static for that matter)
variable `n' in the function MakeDetachedEnvironment. But codeblocks, in
effect, create a (for want of a better term) lexical environment that can be
passed around. MAIN() can't actually see `n', it can only make calls to an
environment created in MakeDetachedEnvironment.

Logically it follows that this "lexical environment" ability should extend
to scoping within classes. That is, ideally, a codeblock would bind a
method's environment in the same way that it binds a function's environment.
In the case of a method this would include binding it's "class membership"
so that it inherits the scoping rights of the method in which it was
created.

Given this explanation, why should there be the restriction you speak of?

Sure, not forcing anyone to do this. Note though that I don't raise this for
the intellectual challenge, I raise this 'cos it's a problem I've run into
with Class(y) on a number of occasions. It's easy to work around (have the
codeblocks call a method instead of doing the work in a codeblock) but it's
annoying that it doesn't work "just right".

Compiler now generates a different PCODE for a MACRO if the macro is a
parameter of a function call. Instead of the normal HB_P_MACROPUSH it
generates an HB_P_MACROPUSHARG. This information in return is forwarded to
the macro compiler to allow/disallow comma separated list. If the macro
compiler is servicing a HB_P_MACROPUSHARG list is allowed, otherwise list
will cause the desired syntax error.

Example:

Procedure Main()

   LOCAL cVar, cMacro := "1,2,3"

   ? Test( &cMacro ) // Test() will receive 1,2,3 as 3 parameters.

   cVar := &cMacro   // Will raise a & Error.

RETURN

Function Test( p1, p2, p3 )

   ? p1, p2, p3

RETURN PCount()

In summary, usage of a macro list anywhere other than function argument will
cause a & syntax error.

Message-ID: <3B554916.DCE4307@corevia.com>

Hi,
I am working in a Harbour feature which uses hb_compGenC() and yesterday
I noticed this function changes the pFileName->szName member to upper
case.

I don't know if this could cause future problems (in OS's like Linux
which is case-aware for filenames) but it should be changed to work with
a local copy of pFileName instead and also it only should change the
name to upper case when -n option is not used.

Any thoughts about this ?

WM_Regards,
José Lalín

Is it ok if I create a "doc" and a "doc/en" subdirectory in libct and
put the documentation there ?
And it would be great, if someone speaking english better than me would
loop through the docu and make correct english out of it ;-))

I won't claim to understand where this might be a problem in harbour but I
wanted to say that, if possible, no code in harbour should make any
assumptions about filename case if harbour is to live up to it's claim of
being "cross platform".

S'ok, I've got one of them as well <g>. I appreciate you thinking about
this. Like I say, I think my reasoning is sound but it doesn't follow that
it has to be implemented. But, at the same time, I don't think it follows
that the restriction makes sense.

IOW, it's an "obscure bug".

Doesn't this fix mean that there incompatibility that Ryszard documented
still exists? Consider this code:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
Function Main()
Local cGoodInput := "3.141"
Local cBadInput  := "3,141"
Local bError     := errorblock( {|o| break( o ) } )

   Begin Sequence

      SomeFunction( &cGoodInput )
      SomeFunction( &cBadInput )

   Recover

      ? "ERROR: Data feed is corrupt!"

   End Sequence

Return( NIL )

Static Function SomeFunction( n )

   ? "I received ", n

Return( NIL )
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

Again, imagine that the "input" in the above has come from some external
source, the error system is being used to help trap formatting errors in the
data feed.

The above code, in CA-Clipper, first prints "3.141" and then prints the
message warning us that the data feed is corrupt. 

In harbour, even with your latest fix, what happens is that we don't detect
the corruption in the data feed, worse still, we end up getting fed
incorrect data because harbour's VM has decided to "silently" change the way
the language works.

>From what I can see, even with this fix, Ryszard's warning still holds true
because we've now got a compiler/VM that produces different results from
CA-Clipper.

Reply-To: harbour@matrixlist.com

David,

I made a few tests, I only have to change all USHORTs to ULONGs to make it
work.
This added parameter is not the last of the list (but only an added
parameter _before_ the list) but makes va_start() work as expected since it
is not promoted to a bigger type (while an USHORT is promoted to an ULONG).

This comes from va_xxx() help of EMX GCC (read restrictions):

   Headers:

  #include <stdarg.h>

  Prototypes:

  type va_arg (va_list arg_ptr, type);
  void va_end (va_list arg_ptr);
  void va_start (va_list arg_ptr, type prev_arg);

  Compatibility:

  C90

  Description:

  Access arguments of a function with variable number of arguments.  You
have to declare a variable of type va_list, for
  instance arg_ptr.  Use

      va_start (arg_ptr, prev_arg)

  where prev_arg is the argument preceding the variable arguments, to
initialize arg_ptr.  Use

      va_arg (arg_ptr, type)

  to get the next argument, which is of type type.  Use

      va_end (arg_ptr)

  when you no longer need arg_ptr.

  Return value:

  See above.

  Restrictions:

  prev_arg must not be declared register, must not be of function or array
type, and the type must be compatible to the   type that results from
promotion.  For instance, prev_arg must not be of type char or float.

  type must be compatible to the type that results from promotion.  For
instance, type must not be unsigned char or
  float (instead, use unsigned int and double, respectively).

  See also: vprintf()

  Example: See /emx/samples/stdarg.c



Now, my question is: can I change all USHORTs to ULONGs? I think I can do
it without any side-effect but I'd like to be assured about this.


regards.


PS. hb_itemDo() does have this workaround of an extra parameter, but I
think there are calls to it which don't consider this (like
\vm\macro.c:154) and are, because of this, wrong.

Uhmm,

I've looked around a bit with reguard to var_arg() macro use and I think
that using a USHORT as previous parameter to a ... (variable length
parameter) is WRONG at least on an ANSI C compiler.

In fact, changing hb_errRT_BASE_SubstR(,,,, USHORT uiArgCount) to an ULONG
fixed my problem!

And note that uiArgCount should be an UINT not a USHORT.

So, I'd like to hear from a C guru if I am correct or not and if I can
change all prototypes of functions which use a var_arg() macro from short
to long parameters.

regards.

David,

I've changed all functions which have a va_start() from USHORT to ULONG and
I've rebuilt everything.

Now hbtest.prg works againg and so does my little test program.

I will upload these changes ASAP.

'cos there's already a profile reporter in the RTL and I'd only CVS it if
the authors of the existing code (yourself and Patrick) were happy to swap
to an OO approach.

As I said, I didn't write this to "compete" with the code you and Patrick
have written (I did it for fun more than anything, and to do a little more
"shakedown" work on harbour's class system) but if I were to commit it to
CVS while PROFILE.PRG existed it'd be unnecessary redundancy.

It still needs some polishing (there's a couple of TODO: items in there) but
it should serve to illustrate the profile reporting approach I had in mind.

I think it's a more elegant and modular approach than the current code but
I'm not sure if it's actually overkill.

Still, for personal amusement, overkill's fun. ;>

I have no problem giving up the current Profiler.prg for a better
replacement.
If your class is tested and can do all the current profiler can do,
please CVS it.

If it's better, it's better, no argument! ;-)

You guys have a play and see what you think. If nobody else has any
objections to this approach I'll drop it into CVS as a replacement for
PROFILE.PRG in the next couple of days.

That said, I'd like us to get to the bottom of the other profiler issues
I've raised too. Time accounting on GNU/Linux doesn't seem to be working too
well and the OS/2/GCC/EMX sample that was just posted suggests that clock()
works different there as well.

We might want to look at a better and more portable method of accounting for
time.

I don't know what happened to the above but it's almost impossible to read.
But, if I'm reading it correctly, there's some interesting things going on
here. It would appear that your environment has around 100 ticks per second.
clock() on GNU/Linux claims to have 1000000:

,----
| CONFORMING TO
|        ANSI C.  POSIX requires that CLOCKS_PER_SEC equals 1000000
|        independent of the actual resolution.
`----

which is also different from the 1000 figure that Antonio seems to have
used.

Antonio, can you clarify this value?

Dave,

I haven't used it. Patrick asked me and I showed him the Borland docs:

-------
clock     <TIME.H>

Returns number of clock ticks since program start

Declaration

clock_t clock(void);

Remarks

clock can be used to determine the time interval between two events.

To determine the time in seconds, divide the value returned by clock by the
value of the macro CLK_TCK. (notice that clock.h #define CLK_TCK is 1000.0)

Return Value

On success, returns the processor time elapsed since the beginning of the
program invocation.

On failure (the processor time is not    available, or its value can't be
represented), returns -1.

Portability

DOS	UNIX	Windows	ANSI C	C++ only
yes		yes	yes

See Also

time

Example

clock example
-------

Besides that, there are other curious readings from the profiler
reports. A function/procedure/method may consume zero ticks (obviously
they consume some time, but not enough for a tick), but the funny thing
is that the sume of all those (almost) zero ticks is zero :-) Something
that we all know it is impossible.

If we could find a replacement for clock(), to get milliseconds
instead of clock ticks, that would be perfect.

Dear Friends

I was thinking to add native support for this CUA members.

I has this classes all derived from Get and works fine with Harbour.

Of this classes, Radio and Checkbox are used in hbmake.

If no one complain, i´ll add this files to the rtl directory

I think there's little doubt then that we need to find something better for
doing these measurements.

Anyone got any suggestions?

It half works in Class(y). As an example, this:

,----
| #include "class(y).ch"
|
| Function Main()
|
|    ? Foo():new():block()
|
| Return( NIL )

|
| Method init()
|
|    ::cName := "davep"
|
| Return( self )
|
| Method block()
| Return( eval( {|| ::cName } ) )
`----

works in CA-Clipper with Class(y) but fails in harbour (prior to your
chance, I've yet to download, build and test it).

This:

,----[ foo.prg ]
| #include "class(y).ch"
|
| Function Main()
|
|    ? eval( Foo():new():block() )
|
| Return( NIL )

|

| Return( {|| ::cName } )
`----

fails with both Class(y) and harbour.

Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't Clipper 5.3 make these kinds of things
available? Is your implementation of these things compatible with those in
5.3? I'd have said that if such things were to be added to the RTL they
should be added so as to provide CA-Clipper 5.3 compatibility.

Just built with the changes. This form of scope detachment still fails (it
defeats Class(y) too):

,----
| #include "hbclass.ch"
|
| Function Main()
|
|    ? eval( Foo():new():block() )
|
| Return( NIL )
|
| Create Class Foo
|
|    Protected:
|
|       Var cName
|
|    Exported:
|
|       Method init
|       Method block
|
| End Class
|
| Method init()
|
|    ::cName := "davep"
|
| Return( self )
|
| Method block()
| Return( {|| ::cName } )
`----

Personally I think it should work. Given that codeblocks can be used to pass
"environments" around an application it's very tempting to think that, as
with detached locals, you'd get detached scope too.

Would that be possible? Can scope in a codeblock be decided based on where
the codeblock was created?

This form now works as expected (bringing harbor on par with Class(y)):

,----
| #include "hbclass.ch"
|
| Function Main()
|
|    ? Foo():new():block()
|
| Return( NIL )
|
| Create Class Foo
|
|    Protected:
|
|       Var cName
|
|    Exported:
|
|       Method init
|       Method block
|
| End Class
|
| Method init()
|
|    ::cName := "davep"
|
| Return( self )
|
| Method block()
| Return( eval( {|| ::cName } ) )
`----

But, this fix seems to be defeated by inheritance:

,----
| #include "hbclass.ch"
|
| Function Main()
|
|    ? Bar():new():block()
|
| Return( NIL )
|
| Create Class Foo
|
|    Protected:
|
|       Var cName
|
|    Exported:
|
|       Method init
|
| End Class
|
| Method init() Class Foo
|
|    ::cName := "davep"
|
| Return( self )
|
| Create Class Bar Inherit Foo
|
|    Exported:
|
|       Method block
|
| End Class
|
| Method block() Class Bar
| Return( eval( {|| ::cName } ) )
`----

fails with a scope violation error.

Just to be clear, is the code you're wanting to place in CVS code that
implements 5.3 compatible behaviour? If so I can't imagine that there would
be any significant objections.

What is the nature of the fix (I looked at the ChangeLog entry but couldn't

I do not agree with you here. Using the codeBlock outside any
allowed method (in the scoping point of view) must restrict the
(mis)use of this protected var.

> Would that be possible?

Humm, seem very difficult to implement as I would have to keep

Why must there be this restriction?

If you look at how codeblocks work, or, more to the point, what they
provide, scope binding is one of the features. Consider the binding of scope
of local and static variables. I can do this with a codeblock:

,----
| Function Main()
| Local aBlocks := MakeDetachedEnvironment()
|
|    ? eval( aBlocks[ 1 ] )
|    eval( aBlocks[ 2 ], 23 )
|    ? eval( aBlocks[ 1 ] )
|
| Return( NIL )
|
| Function MakeDetachedEnvironment()
| Local n := 0
| Return( { {|| n }, {|i| n := i } } )
`----

MAIN() has no "right" to access the local (or static for that matter)
variable `n' in the function MakeDetachedEnvironment. But codeblocks, in
effect, create a (for want of a better term) lexical environment that can be
passed around. MAIN() can't actually see `n', it can only make calls to an
environment created in MakeDetachedEnvironment.

Logically it follows that this "lexical environment" ability should extend
to scoping within classes. That is, ideally, a codeblock would bind a
method's environment in the same way that it binds a function's environment.
In the case of a method this would include binding it's "class membership"
so that it inherits the scoping rights of the method in which it was
created.

Given this explanation, why should there be the restriction you speak of?

Sure, not forcing anyone to do this. Note though that I don't raise this for
the intellectual challenge, I raise this 'cos it's a problem I've run into
with Class(y) on a number of occasions. It's easy to work around (have the
codeblocks call a method instead of doing the work in a codeblock) but it's
annoying that it doesn't work "just right".

Compiler now generates a different PCODE for a MACRO if the macro is a
parameter of a function call. Instead of the normal HB_P_MACROPUSH it
generates an HB_P_MACROPUSHARG. This information in return is forwarded to
the macro compiler to allow/disallow comma separated list. If the macro
compiler is servicing a HB_P_MACROPUSHARG list is allowed, otherwise list
will cause the desired syntax error.

Example:

Procedure Main()

   LOCAL cVar, cMacro := "1,2,3"

   ? Test( &cMacro ) // Test() will receive 1,2,3 as 3 parameters.

   cVar := &cMacro   // Will raise a & Error.

RETURN

Function Test( p1, p2, p3 )

   ? p1, p2, p3

RETURN PCount()

In summary, usage of a macro list anywhere other than function argument will
cause a & syntax error.

Ron

Hi,
I am working in a Harbour feature which uses hb_compGenC() and yesterday
I noticed this function changes the pFileName->szName member to upper
case.

I don't know if this could cause future problems (in OS's like Linux
which is case-aware for filenames) but it should be changed to work with
a local copy of pFileName instead and also it only should change the
name to upper case when -n option is not used.

Any thoughts about this ?

Is it ok if I create a "doc" and a "doc/en" subdirectory in libct and

And it would be great, if someone speaking english better than me would

Dave,

yes, OS/2 GCC EMX clock() function ticks 100 times per second.

Now, is there away to know how many ticks/second are counted on each platform?

My time.h has CLOCKS_PER_SEC and CLK_TCK defined to 100, is something similar
available on all supported platforms?

I couldn't disagree more!

The xBase dialect allowed macro of arguments list, since its inception as
dBase. Your comment would be just as valid against the many other fixes
Harbour has over Clipper.

Consider this version of your sample code:

//---------------------------------------------------------//
Procedure Main()

   LOCAL   cGoodInput := "SomeVar"
   LOCAL   cBadInput  := "SomeVar++"
   LOCAL   bError     := errorblock( {|o| break( o ) } )

   PRIVATE SomeVar    := 0

   Begin Sequence

      SomeFunction( &cGoodInput )
      SomeFunction( &cBadInput )

   Recover

      ? "ERROR: Data feed is corrupt!"

   End Sequence

Return( NIL )

Static Function SomeFunction( n )

   ? "I received ", n

Return( NIL )
//---------------------------------------------------------//

Now I could of course claim:

``The above code, in CA-Clipper, first prints "I received            0" and
then prints the
message warning us that the data feed is corrupt.

In Harbour, what happens is that we don't detect
the corruption in the data feed, worse still, we end up getting fed
incorrect data because Harbour's VM has decided to "silently" change the way
the language works.''

But this would be silly, because numerous other fixes and enhancements to
Harbour make it a candidate for such incompatibilities, which are actually
improvements that can be viewed as incompatibilities on by those who care to
see it from this very limited perspective.

This feature is there to allow the likes of:

cFields := "Field1m Field2, Field3"
LIST NEXT &cFields

AS well as many other popular applications.

Finally, were you not the person who wrote:

"[I've sent a CC: of this to the developers list so anyone interested can
 address the filename case with DO issue and also so the macro compiler
 authors and/or the author of LIST can have a think about how and why
 FlagShip allows you to do what you're doing despite the fact that it's not
 something that's allowed in CA-Clipper]"

so we need to divide total numeber of clock ticks by CLK_TCK to have
correct elapsed time.

Yes. We may implement a (low level C) function that
performs that division, so the proper CLK_TCK -for each OS- is used.

Antonio,

no, I made a little search on groups.google.com, and I found out that
CLK_TCK is the deprecated name for CLOCKS_PER_SEC. So we need to divide for
it.

It returns the previous hb_bProfiler value.

Maurilio, Dave,

I propose to add this function to source\rtl\seconds.c

HB_FUNC( TICKS2SECS )
{
   hb_retnl( hb_parnl( 1 ) / CLK_TCK );
}

Would it be ok ?

That we divide by CLOCKS_PER_SEC.

Ok, then we may do:

HB_FUNC( CLOCKS2SECS )
{
   hb_retnl( hb_parnl( 1 ) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC );
}

I CVS it,

Dave, this seems to be the right function to calculate
the seconds from the clock ticks, for every OS.

   Clocks2Secs( <nClocks> ) --> <nSecs>

A low level function that simply returns the divisor would suffice (although
we still have the problem that clock() might not be a good solution after
all).

I'm not reporting bugs to the developer's of CA-Clipper, I'm reporting a bug
to the developers of harbour. Harbour is supposed to be a free software
CA-Clipper compatible compiler and I've posted an instance of valid
CA-Clipper code having an entirely different outcome in harbour.

This is a bug in harbour.

Good point, another example of incompatibility, and less obvious than the
one I pointed out.

Limited perspective? Why insult my bug report? What purpose does that serve?

I know what the change is there for, I'm reporting that the change you've
made doesn't address Ryszard's observation even though you claimed it fixed
it.

I know I wrote that, what's your reason for quoting it back to me? Are you
suggesting that because I was kind enough to raise the issue for people to
think about that I actually back this change and that I'm somehow
responsible for it or something?

One fun problem: __setProfiler() always shows up at least once in the

I'll probably end up filtering it out.

I know. I have two version of this classes,One that do the same as
Ca-Clipper 5.3 and an other one that I use with Ca-Clipper 5.2e that is
derived from Get Class

Hi Luiz,

I've created a little test.mk with hbmake and when I try to compile with
it (on OS/2 GCC EMX) I get:

(E:\harbour\test)..\bin\hbmake test.mk

test.cSYS1041: Il nome ..\bin\..\harbour non è riconosciuto come
un comando interno o esterno, un programma eseguibile

\..\gcc  @makefile.@@@SYS1041: Il nome \..\gcc non è riconosciuto come
un comando interno o esterno, un programma eseguibile
o un file batch.

(E:\harbour\test)


As you can see it calls harbour.exe and gcc.exe with completely wrong
paths.

regards.

In CA-Clipper the column header comes out on two lines because of the
semi-colon. Harbour's TBColumn simply uses the header as-is.

Can you please check if and where in your standard C include files you
can find the definition of "struct exception" (should be "math.h") ? 
It may be that the definition doesn't exist or that it is "struct
_exception" or something like that.

this seems to have the same reason like the problems with math.c.
Please, can you check your math.h ? Seems like there is a lacking of
some definitions, e.g. DOMAIN, PLOSS etc. If, on the other hand, your
compiler doesn't support a custom math handler, we have to consider
these circumstances and add some #ifdefs in hbmath.h.

I dont know , My tests with GCC(DJGPP/gcc 2.9.53) works fine.
Also harbour.exe must be in the same directory of hbmake.exe

Martin,

it is not defined :-/

regards.

PS. My compiler has signal management, but I don't know if this can
replace what you're looking for.
      And this is online help for matherr().

   Headers:

  #include <math.h>

  Prototype:

  int matherr (struct exception *x);

  Compatibility:

  SysV

  Description:

  Exception handler for floating point math.

  Return value:

  0       success

  non-0   error

  Restrictions:

  matherr() is not implemented.

  See also: sigaction(), signal()

regards.

since our goal is compatibility with C52 with some C53 extensions you
should add the C53  compatibles. Just my two cents.

Subject: [Harbour] Harbour object module generation
Message-ID: <3B559168.541DAE00@corevia.com>

Hi all,
these days I have been working in something that was in my TODO list
many months ago.

I added a new option to Harbour (-go) to build native object modules
(.OBJ) from PRG sources very easily:

* it uses a config file "harbour.cfg" with some "macros" as we are using
in our makefiles:

CC=bcc32
CFLAGS=-c -Ic:\harbour\include ...

* first, it uses hb_compGenC() to build the C output and calls the
compiler defined in harbour.cfg to build the OBJ,
* Harbour deletes the intermediate .C file (this could be optional),
* ¡ and it's done ! We already have the OBJ from the PRG.

I see a lot of benefits to this:
* It will reduce the standard makefiles because this eliminates the
intermediate C->OBJ rule and they will be easy to update.
* We don't need anymore the platform specific *.ASM files on the CVS nor
TASM/MASM tools  to build Harbour.
* The harbour.cfg config file can be anywhere in the path or in the app
directory.
* It runs on all platforms (well, it needs some tuning to run on OS/2 &
Linux).
* To add this feature we don't need to change anything in the compiler
nor the libraries: it is an independent module.
* Very important for novice users, we can still use our old make files
from our applications (using hbmake, rmake or our favorite make tool).
We just need to change the compiler name.

If anyone is interested I can send a ZIP (Harbour.exe, harbour.cfg, a
small RMK and a little test) to Patrick so he can upload it to the FTP.

I would like to hear opinions before CVS it.

WM_Regards,
José Lalín

Not necessarily.

That really depends on if you donated the code to Antonio or if Antonio and
yourself have decided to make it a collaborative effort. IOW, it's really an
issue between the copyright holder of the code you modified and yourself.

That might need some tweaking for it to work well in other environments. By
convention, on GNU/Linux, it'd probably be in /etc/ or /usr/local/etc
depending on how the user has installed harbour.

Aside from the issue I raise above, what needs tweaking to make it work on
GNU/Linux?

Why is it separate from the compiler? I'd have thought it would be handy to
have it as part of the compiler.

That said, I ship a utility called gharbour with the harbour RPM that I
maintain, it does pretty much what you're talking about here. I'd very much
welcome a cross-platform tool that does this job.

It should be a simple step to provide a "linker" like this too (I supply a
harbour-link tool in the harbour RPM).

If the functions in the math library (like log, exp etc.) call a signal
on certain errors, this could be a replacement. Look at the docu for
e.g. exp() and search for any error handling mechanism. If the error
handling is done only by special return values, we have to do that other
way. 

But anyway, I will look for a way to make math.c available for
non-matherr-compilers.

Message-ID: <3B559B14.8A2AEA81@libero.it>

Hi,

now, recompiling and executing a little utility I've written causes this
error (I think inside hb_stackNewFrame()).

Every other test I made seem to work ok (and no, removing scoping from
TBrowse() does not fix this one) so I don't think this comes from my
latest changes, but the other day I didn't try to recompile this one, so
I don't know for sure.

Any idea?

regards.

PS. I've rebuilt _everything_ a couple of time.

Does it work on all platforms? Including those that still use a console
window? If the answer is no, then it can't go in the RTL and must go
into CONTRIB.

Guys,

tests\testdecl.prg gives a strange error:

Unrecoverable error 9002: No ERRORBLOCK() for error

There are no errorblocks or begin/end sequence, so what? The same error on
win32.

Maybe, it was a mistake, I suggest to wait for the next incident. 
The best should be to read his apologies...

Ok, let's try to think :-)

my program dies here:

METHOD DispCell( nColumn, nColor ) CLASS TBrowse

>>   LOCAL ftmp := Eval(::aColumns[nColumn]:block) <<<
   LOCAL nCol := Col()

   local cColor   := iif(::aColumns[nColumn]:ColorBlock != NIL,;
                         hb_ColorIndex(::ColorSpec,
Eval(::aColumns[nColumn]:ColorBlock, ftmp)[nColor] - 1),;
                         hb_ColorIndex(::ColorSpec, nColor - 1))

   do case

this is a code snippet from tbrowse.prg method dispcell(). DispCell() is an
hidden method which tries to evaluate a code block which uses a public
instance variable (and I'm inside a class which is derived from TBrowse).

Is there something wrong in codeblock evaluation? I quickly read a thread
about private variables and codeblocks this morning. Has it something to do
with it?

And if so, why removing scoping from tbrowse.prg does not fix this?

Jean, I'm sorry, but I need your help.

regards.

Martin,

yes, no exception thrown.

This is help for exp()

   Headers:

  #include <math.h>

  Prototypes:

  double exp (double x);
  long double expl (long double x);

  Compatibility:

  C90 C9X

  Description:

  exp() computes the exponential function of x.  On overflow, +INF is
returned and errno set to ERANGE.

  expl() uses the long double format.

  Return value:

  exp() returns e^x.  On overflow, exp() returns +INF.

  See also: log(), pow()

in WinTel platforms it uses searchpath() to locate the file. I will try
tomorrow to change to portable code.

Is there in Linux a standard PATH environ var ? Something like the PATH
in MS OS's.

Just some little things, I need to know:
* if there is an equivalent for NUL like DOS device, to redirect the
output from the C compiler. This is optional and I'd like to complete
it.
* if unlink() is a ANSI C function. I am using it to delete the
temporary C file.

Well, it's part of the compiler. I meant that we don't need to change
the compiler source or date structures. That's why I called it
"independant".

This is in my TOTHINK list too.

I was not fully sure about this, that's why I asked.

Then we should change hb_compGenXXX() to work with a local copy of
PHB_FNAME structure.

Yes, it's called PATH and uses ":" as a separator. However, configuration
files shouldn't be stored in the PATH, only executable files should be
stored in the path so there's little point in looking in it for the config
file.

unlink() is available (it comes from Un*x).

Where is the appropiate place on Linux boxes for this kind of file then
? We can use a #ifdef here to differentiate it from WinTel platforms.

> /dev/null
so, is this correct in your platform "system( "whatevercommand >
/dev/null" )" ? I need to know this to get the verbose option working on
Linux machines.

> unlink() is available (it comes from Un*x).
Well, then I can safely remove this TODO from the source.

In one of the 'etc' directories and/or in a "dot file" in the users home
directory.

Here's how this usually works:

If the executable is installed in /usr/bin then the config file should
probably live in /etc, if it's installed in /usr/local/bin it should
probably life in /usr/local/etc. Given that installation is usually a
build-time thing (make; make install) the path to the config file is
generally written into the program (IOW "hard coded", ish).

If the program supports a "dot file" then it would be a file, by convention,
named something like ".harbourrc", in the user's home directory. Often a
program that supports a dot file will also support an "etc" config file and
will use the dot-file in preference to the "etc" file.

No, it's not actually as complex as it sounds. If you like I'd be happy to
look over the source and write the support for this.

Not knowing what this is written in at the moment (C perhaps?) I can't
comment on the exact syntax but, yes, you'd write "foo > /dev/null" to
direct output to the null device. Note that Un*x shells generally allow you
do redirect both stdout and stderr. For example, to direct both stdout and
stderr to the null device you'd use something like "foo > /dev/null 2>&1".

Yes, that's what I am looking for.

then, to redirect the console output from a C compiler on Un*x:
"MyCompiler <args> > dev/null" is enough ? Or do I need to redirect
stdout too ?

Jos, I just noticed that the source was available. I've not even tried to
compile it yet but the attached patch should get you started with the Unix
side of things. Working with /etc/harbour.cfg should suffice for now.

"/dev/null". "dev/null" is unlikely to exist. In case you don't know Un*x
boxen have a /dev directory in which all the devices of the machine live.
null is one of them.

[Aside]

There's some fun ones in there. For example, there's the exact opposite of
null called "full". Yeah, /dev/full. It's a device that is guaranteed to be
full (unlike null, which is guaranteed never to be full).

It probably sounds crazy until you find yourself needing to test some code
and see what happens if it writes to a full device...

Sorry, that was confusing wasn't it? ">", on it's own, redirects stdout.
Doing "foo > /dev/null" will redirect stdout of "foo" to the null device,
that's the same as "foo > nul" under DOS.

What I was (unhelpfully?) pointing out was that with most Un*x shells you
get the facility to redirect stderr too (something DOS's COMMAND.COM doesn't
allow, the likes of 4DOS do (and CMD.EXE IIRC?)).

Well, it seems this error is justified. Please note that line 26 is trying
to sort an Array of *different* types, using a code block that uses '<' for
comparisons. This results in attempted comparisons like: "2 < .T." which of
course should produce an error.

If you change the block in line 26 to "{| x, y | xToStr(x) < xToStr(y) }"
all appears to work ok.

Go on, you know it makes sense. Come over to the light side of the source.

LOL! Actually, there's one subtle difference, /dev/full has a use.

Sorry, but I consider your description inaccurate. The above was trying to
explain that *many* fixes/improvements Harbour has over Clipper result in
what *could* be described as incompatibilities/bugs. IMO this position
reflect a limited point of view.

Harbour's macro compiler is *far* superior when compared to Clipper's
(hurtful thanks to Ryszard!). As a result *many* macro expressions that
produce a '&' Error in Clipper, compile perfectly in Harbour (as one would
hope). By definition this causes "incompatibilities" based on that narrow
point of view expressed by your position.

I seriously doubt that majority of this group, considers Harbour's Macro
Compiler ability to properly compiler ++,--,+=,-=,*=,/=,^=,nested blocks,
and *many* other great improvements a "bug". I further doubt that the group
will be interested in ``fixing'' such bugs, by forcing the macro compiler
back to Clipper's specs.

This was not intended as an insult, and I ask that you don't consider my
repeating this position in this reply, further insults. I believe I have the
right to consider such position as the projection of a limited, or narrow,
point of view. This does not intent to reflect or rate your qualifications
(which I would guess are many and great).

I disagree. Ryszard's observation was 100% valid. Because it warned against
accepting a list in places where the language does not support lists. This
was a true bug that had to fixed, and indeed was fixed.

Because, your original post encouraged a review of what was understood as
desirable feature (and I agree). Why would I hold you "responsible" for
something I actually did, and am proud for? Please don't think I'm hoping to
share any blame (though I don't mind sharing the credit), because I for one,
consider this just one more improvement Harbour has over Clipper.

BTW, I think your original code sample makes an odd assumption with regard
to cBadInput. It strikes me as strange that a string derived from a numeric
input, will somehow include a comma (instead of period). I don't think I
remember reading any Clipper code that allows a comma as a character into a
numeric input.

We spoke recently about splitting the contrib directory from 
harbour and making it it's own source forge project.

We should talk some about this before we do it.

1. I think it's time. Do you?

2. Same core mailing list or a separate core mailing list for contrib?

I'm guessing it was a mistake. List removal seems a bit harsh for a 
first offence. A 'please don't do that' warning should be adequate.

So, Michel, please don't do that. Thanks.

Yes with the same exeption as for Harbour Runtime.
so as the product could be used in any commercial package but 
not sold as a stand alone lib.

Phil,

it's not the time (we don't even have 1.0 of harbour).

Discussion about contrib should remain here since any piece of contrib
could become  part of harbour any time.

Phil, friends,

> 1. I think it's time. Do you?

Just for discussion:

PROs might be:
a) Harbour project can be seen as an exact clone of Cli**er 5.2e (with
some extensions from 5.3) and everything that isn't Clipper 5.2e should
go somewhere else (but see CON a)

b) Harbour core development is not disturbed by contrib development (but
see CON b)

c) Set of 3rd party grows virtually.

CONs:
a) Harbour isn't an exact clone, there are many good and useful RTL
extensions but why are they in the core RTL and not in contrib ?  That
happened by random, not by exact distinction of core and contrib. And
consider, that a development tools' power is 95% related to the power of
its RTL. That said, one could even think about incorporating contrib
into the RTL. That won't disturb nothing, enlarges Harbours power, ...

b) Contrib development does not disturb core development, it can even
help improve it because this is a good test for Harbour's extensibility.
And, is there really a difference discussing about STRTRAN or NUMTOKEN ? 

c) Harbour users have everything in one package/project.

d) Contrib developpers could feel like 2nd class contributers (core =
1st class).

> 2. Same core mailing list or a separate core mailing list for contrib?

If the projects are separated, separate lists, if not, not.

In summary, I am not sure if it is really necessary nor really helpful
to split the development. The PRO option a) can be considered IMO, but I
can't follow option b) and c). Has someone else a good reason for
splitting or is in favour of any points I have given ?

Regards

Martin

Time to talk, ... perhaps

We don't have too many contrib up to now and I really don't see 
any good reason to change to a separate CVS. At least one of 
them is absolutly needed here for my test (ADS RDD) and so till 
the native RDD (NTX and CDX) are ok. HBMAKE seem really 
promising and I will surely use it ...

So I would like to wait the first 1.0 or 1.0 beta version, then we 
could talk about that.
 
> 2. Same core mailing list or a separate core mailing list for contrib?

In all case not a separate list for me, I actually concentrate myself 
on the OO system but I'm happy to seem the evolution/apparition 
of most of the contrib project. Also, what would append when some 
guy discover something is wrong when trying to compile his contrib 
... Then he would had to change to the core list to post a message 
...

Don't be so silly Ron. The accuracy isn't debatable, the importance of the
problem is the issue that's debatable.

Quite the opposite, the point of view I am coming from is far from limited.
I'm simply saying that Ryszard reported a problem, you responded by saying
the problem is fixed (which suggests you saw it as a problem too) and I've
since reported that the *meta*-problem is still there. That's all.

There's nothing "limited" in what I said or why I said it. Quite the
opposite in fact.

This isn't a narrow definition of compatible, it's a very wide definition,
it's about existing code that will break in silent and subtle ways. That's
not a narrow point of view at all. It then becomes a judgement call as to if
the gains outweigh the losses.

Personally I think they do, I can tell from your reaction that you've
decided that I don't <sigh>.

Then don't think about numeric input, think about the explanation of the
possible source that I spoke about. Hint: Numerics are seldom actually read
in as numerics when they come from external sources. IOW, I guess your lack
of experience of a problem like this comes down to the fact that you've
probably never had to accept a stream of data from a source that you have no
control over and whose format, over time, can and will change without
warning (yes, I had to deal with that once). Be thankful that you haven't.

In summary: Stop looking at what I'm reporting with a narrow perspective,
then stop attributing the narrow perspective you're using to me. Consider
the meta-problem that I was considering and highlighting and think about the
impact on people porting code to harbour. 

Personally I think the problem is an acceptable one compared to the benefits
harbour's macro compiler delivers. Perhaps you do too. If so, say so without
shooting the messenger and acting as if the messenger believes the message.

If this still confuses you, think about who the author of the FAQ is and
think about how, in the long run, he's bound to want to be totally sure
about the design decisions behind harbour.

Harbour's licence doesn't forbid the selling of harbour. If ObjectDB had a
similar licence to harbour it wouldn't forbid selling either.

Adding this stuff to harbour's RTL is less about the above and more about
"namespace" issues. Moreover, from what I've seen, many of the harbour
extensions have either being added in a more-or-less-compatible way or
they've been placed in a well defined "namespace" (the odd function from
Antonio aside <g>).

This is an issue for *distribution*, not for development. Having two
different projects doesn't affect distribution.

Why? I don't feel like a 2nd class author because I maintain a small library
for harbour that isn't in the core and isn't in contrib. Why should anyone
else?

More to the point, what does that make people who write code with harbour?
3rd class developers?

How would having contrib as a separate CVS project stop you from conducting

hbmake is a perfect candidate for being a separate CVS project IMO.

Ok, :-) Lets so say 'unable to re-use the sources to sell some 
stand alone lib ...' But in fact the authors is probably the best guy 
to chose the kind of licence.

Just having two cvs project to maintain for the first.

Also, more than one time I had to make some minor change within 
one or other contrib source just because my VC++ doe'snt handle 
the code the same way BC or GCC does. SO I have to also be a 
'developer' within the contrib CVS where in fact I'm not.

You say it ... candidate :-))))
 
Ok, we will surely have (one day) two separate CVS project but I 
thing it's a bit early.

My point of view.

Even that is permissible depending on the circumstances.

My understanding was that Phil was soliciting opinion from this mailing list
because the author in question isn't sure about what sort of licence to
choose. IOW, he seems to think he's the "worst guy" to choose the licence
(as you may recall, a "decision" was made to use the GPL, which would have
cause him and others no end of problems).

Yes, that's right, there are some contrib libs that export (hopefully
not too many) functions using the same names. Internal functions can and
should be brought to a "secure" namespace.

This is a definition problem. If contrib was a part of Harbour, and the
contrib part was not stable, then Harbour would not be stable. If the
RTL was _per definition_ not a part of the Harbour core (but only the
compiler itself), and the RTL was not stable, but the Harbour core was,
the RTL and Harbour were out of sync. If we agree that, at the moment,
"Harbour" is all but contrib excluded, you are right.

It doesn't _necessarily_ but _can_ affect distribution. People are lazy
sometimes ;-) and having to download and install two files instead of
one can be ... (no, annoying is too strong, but tedious [not sure if
this word expresses what I want to say, english is not my first
language])

That's good and nor do I. If this is not a problem for anyone, better
yet. But any (human) teamwork is attended by psychological mechanisms -
we have also seen this in this group. I simply wrote about a *potential*
problem that just crossed my mind then I wrote the mail.

You missed the point, I think. I have written about *contributors*, not
about *developers who write code with harbour*. I am far away from
classifying anyone, be it in this group or somewhere else.

In all case, I think the licence should allow it's use in commercial 
package (I must say not free!). Also keeping the authors copyrigth 
should suffice to protect him.

Exactly. Which is why I consider your labeling of this intended behavior as
"This is a bug in harbour." inaccurate. More to the point I don't feel
comfortable with even the word "problem". This is no more than a documented
side effect of an intended improvement.

1. IMO, describing an *intended* behavior, as "This is a bug in harbour."
can only be explained as a limited point of view.

2. Ryszard reported a *real* problem that *does* qualify as a "bug". This
real bug, that Ryszard reported, was fixed. Your description of your sample
scenario, as a bug, and/or as *meta*-problem (of the one Ryszard reported),
is inaccurate, and IMO an expression of limited point of view.

I never said it was a "narrow definition of compatible". I said that
describing this issue as "This is a bug in harbour." represents a narrow
point of view.

100% agree. Thus the label of "bug" was inaccurate, and *neglected* to
consider the *many* *other* *valid* *views* on this issue (thus narrow point
of view). Because if this is a judgment call issue, which has to consider
gains vs. losses, it reinstate the fact that this is a design decision, and
compounded with the fact that this is *intended* behavior it can't be a
"bug".

No I did not, and I'm glad to hear that.

There is no meta-problem. Ryszard reported a bug, while you reported an
*intended* incompatibility, which is/was *obvious* and a direct result of
the enhanced macro compiler in harbour. Ryszard wrote the macro compiler,
and obviously he is well aware of the "incompatibilities" resulting from the
many *intended* improvements. I don't suspect he considers it a problem,
thus your report can not be considered a "meta-problem" of the problem he
reported.

There is a huge defense between a "This is a bug in harbour." and your more
recent view of this issue. My "narrow view" response, was earned by the
unjustified labeling of this issue as a "bug".

100% agree. I hope you can agree that "bug" is not the correct term to
describe *intended* behavior. No programmer I know, would like this term
attached to a logic which works as he/she intended it to be.

I was also thinking of contrib functions that, while they don't clash with
the RTL or VM, might clash with functions in my own applications (for
example). Adding new symbols to the RTL that aren't in some way guarded with
a prefix (__, hb_, __hb_, etc...) means that "conforming" programs might
suddenly be faced with symbol clashes.

Point taken. I'm coming from a POV that says that contrib is something
"separate" from harbour itself (harbour being the pre-processor, compiler,
VM and RTL) anyway. That isn't to say that contrib is any less important,
personally I think there's some really handy things in contrib that should
be projects in their own right due to their utility.

Thing is, having contrib in the same SourceForge project makes no difference
here. For example, the RPM I maintain doesn't include contrib, IIRC this is
true for other binary distributions of harbour. Even now, if someone wants
something from contrib, they might need to download a separate file.

Encouraging laziness and a consumer mentality aside, what I'm pointing out
is that having contrib inside or outside of the core harbour CVS project
makes not one jot of difference to distribution.

Hmm, sure, don't disagree. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if people
are adding things to contrib with the express purpose of having their ego
stroked, and if they're going to get upset if contrib becomes a project in
its own right, they probably need to reassess their motivations for
contributing to the contrib section.

Put another way: "deal with it people". ;)

No, I took your point and ran with it. Point being, the location of
someone's code and it's use and distribution shouldn't be taken as a measure
of self-worth. Moreover, measures of self-worth are probably last on the
list of reasons for keeping contrib where it is or moving it.

How is this a problem? I'm "subscribed" to a number of different CVS
projects on SourceForge and I can update them all with a single command.

I'm not sure I follow what you're saying here. How can you be a developer
and not a developer at the same time?

I don't understand this "too early" thing that a couple of people have
mentioned. It strikes me that if you're going to hive off some code into a
separate project you should do it sooner than later. I see nothing that
suggests that leaving it until later is preferable.

Can anyone give a reason?

Agreed, the GPL with something similar to the guile/harbour exception should
do the trick.

Hang on, which is it, accurate or inaccurate?

Intended behaviour can also be a bug. Having a conforming program work two
different ways, even if it is intentional, is a bug in regards to
compatibility. However, if the project authors as a whole are happy that the
additional facilities provided outweigh the problems caused by this
fundamental change in the language it ceases to be a bug and, instead,
becomes a documented and intentional incompatibility.

Also, you're taking mention of "This is a bug in harbour" totally out of
context. That statement isn't inaccurate no matter how many times you say it
is. It's a statement about which project I was referring to. Don't focus on
"bug" (although the report was questioning if it was a bug, bug reports can
and do do that), focus on the language I was referring to.

If the harbour authors as a whole agree I see no problem with this. I'm
concerned to read that you're not comfortable discussing possible negative
side effects of your code though. I'd have hoped you'd be willing to put
your code up for peer review without branding people's feedback as coming
from an narrow point of view when the feedback in question is offered for
exactly the opposite reason.

This simply documents your (in)ability to think of reasonable reasons for me
raising the issue I did, it says nothing about the actual reasons for me
raising it.

And, again, the quote is taken out of context.

It is not inaccurate. It is accurate, well documented and reproducible.
There is *nothing* at all inaccurate in the report I posted. If there is can
you please show what in <20010718095949.M1518@hagbard.davep.org> is
inaccurate? Note that the email makes no claims and no assertions, it simply
documents a difference and queries the extent of the fix you provided.

So place that quote back in context and read it again, you should find that
this narrowness disappears.

No it didn't. My report was soliciting feedback about the issue, I'd already
considered many of the other points of view, you raised another interesting
one too. Please don't miss-quote the "bug" reference, out of context, and
portray it as if it was the thrust of my initial report - it wasn't.

No disagreement here, this is actually what I've been saying.

I believe there is. I'm trying to discuss it, you seem more interested in
trying to discuss the point of view that lead to it. Hmm.

I don't see how you arrive at that conclusion. That you can read the mind of
Ryszard means nothing about the point I was raising. The report I posted is
obviously a report of the meta-problem. If we're all happy that this is an
intended incompatibility (I am) then so be it. Raising an issue like this
shouldn't result in the tone of response I've had from you (although you do
get more defensive when the code in question is yours, don't worry, I'm used
to it).

There's only a difference if you take that quote out of context and publish
it as what my personal feelings were at the time. Have a go at not doing
that and you might find that this difference doesn't exist.

Oh, I'm sure you feel it's justified. Hopefully you'll start to realise what
I was really trying to report and you won't keep narrowing in on one small
line, taken out of context, used to point out that I was talking about
harbour, not about "Xbase".

Rejoice, you know one now. I've been responsible for plenty of bugs where
the code in question works as intended but it causes problems within the
environment in which the application works, I'd be really surprised to find
that you've never encountered anyone else whose ever experienced this. 

As a purely technical example: ask an OS/2 programmer about the 1/10th
second rule. Ignoring the rule can be intended but, from an users point of
view and an interface point of view, it's a bug.

I'd be highly suspicious of a programmer who can't see that intended
behaviour can also be a bug.

 Let look at it from other side.
 Is there any real reason to split project ?
 What we will win, if we do this ?
 Or there are Harbour users, who reported about their problems with
 the current location of contrib files ?
 I think, any such a change may be done, if there is something, that
 force us to do this - some evident advantages of a new proposed
 status, or some real problems with the current.
 Personally I can live with one project and can with two - nothing
 will changes for me. So, why ?

Perhaps I misunderstand something but if we split the project 
within two CVS project, I can either be an anonymous or a 
developer but distinctly on the two. So I will probably have to also 
be a developer within the Contrib CVS.

The fact I dislike it and I've the feeling I will lost some time is my 
reason.
What's the feeling of the contrib authors ?
They will surely have the same problem (even more probably) I just 
mention, if trying to do something they discover a small problem 
within Harbour RTL or VM they could easily solve. They will be 
obliged to be registred as developer within the two CVS Projects.

Some reasons I can think of:

o contrib might have a different set of registered developers from harbour
  itself. I can imagine that people might want to develop for contrib but
  not be registered as a harbour developer.

o Related to the above, having contrib as something separate from "core"
  harbour might attract contribution developers who might otherwise have
  been put off the idea of developing *for* harbour.

o (very) Possibly silly, but, it helps raise the profile of harbour because
  that would make for three harbour projects on SourceForge (harbour-project
  and harbour-glibc being the current two).

o contrib can and will contain things that are highly platform specific (it
  does now). Harbour itself is supposed to be multi-platform. Splitting
  contrib's sources from harbour's means that the harbour source itself is
  more cross platform (this is the reason I started harbour-glibc as a
  project in its own right).

o People will be able to anon-CVS contrib without the need to anon-CVS the
  whole of harbour (or can they do that now? thinking about it they might be
  able to).

o contrib has little to do with attaining the goal of harbour. It's a loose
  collection of add-ons and experiments that don't really help implement a
  free software Clipper compatible compiler, VM and RTL.

>  Personally I can live with one project and can with two - nothing
>  will changes for me. So, why ?

Agreed, it makes no real difference to be either. I slightly favour it being
a separate project but mostly because I think it would be better for
contrib, not that it would be better for harbour itself.

Personally I'd like to see a number of harbour related projects on
SourceForge. I can imagine the likes of harbour-nflib, harbour-gtlib and so
on would be very handy.

I'm saying that I can update *all* of them with one command, not each of
them with one command. IOW, there's no reason why you can, using a single
command, download all of harbour *and* all of contrib. Unless there's
something about your cvs client and/or your operating system that causes
problems?

Right, yes, you could either be a developer or an anonymous user of either
of the projects. This shouldn't be seen as a problem. If you've got a
SourceForge account you're already sorted.

I'm not sure that this explains why some people feel that leaving a split
until later is a good idea.

Keep in mind that contrib is, by its very nature, dynamic. "contrib authors"
will probably be a group with a greater state of flux then "harbour
authors".

I'm still failing to see why being registered as a developer with two CVS
projects is that big a problem. What is the problem?

Why would a harbour version number of 1.0 be a better time for moving
contrib to it's own project?

Assuming that a split is desirable at all, and I think that in itself is up
for debate, now would seem to be as good a time as any. A separate
contribution effort, a repository of free code that isn't directly related
to harbour but which might be useful to harbour users, sounds like an
excellent project and it would make sense to promote a culture of
contribution sooner than later.

Regarding "should we split", I've given some pros/cons elsewhere. In summary
I think that the contents of contrib are tangential to harbour (yes,
including those platform specific RDDs that people use at the moment) and so
having them as a separate project says at least two things. First, it says
that harbour itself is a multi-platform free software project to create a
CA-Clipper compatible compiler, period. Second, it says that there's a
community growing up *around* harbour and that community is willing to
contributed to an unrelated pool of free software.

More to the point, it would seem that I've got over three megabytes of stuff
in my harbour source directory:

,----
| davep@hagbard:/usr/local/src/harbour/contrib$ du -sh
| 3.3M    .
`----

that is of little direct use to me and to the development of harbour itself.
Parts of it can't even be used on my platform of choice.

In summary: My opinion is that if a split were to take place it should
happen sooner than later.

> 2. Same core mailing list or a separate core mailing list for contrib?

I'd have thought that this mailing list would be fine to start with but, if
contrib takes off, providing a contrib developer's mailing list would
probably be a good idea (kind of like how the user's mailing list got
started, it happened when a need arose).

Hi,
I am almost done with the OBJ generation working on all platforms but I
need some help to finish it:

1) This one is for Dave: is "~/.harbourrc." a directory name ?

With latest changes in Linux it searchs the current path and
"/etc:/usr/local/etc" and I need to know if it can be added to the
search list.

2) In current version when harbour.cfg can't be found it displays an
error with printf(), is this enough or it is better to add a new error
description to the compiler ?

WM_Regards,
José Lalín

If it names a directory: yes, if it names a file: no. Or am I missing the
point of your question?

[BTW, there wouldn't normally be a dot on the end of the filename]

I'd discourage this behaviour for reasons I've said before. Searching the
$PATH for non-executable files is fruitless because the $PATH generally only
points at directories can contain executables:

,----
| davep@hagbard:~$ echo $PATH | tr : "\n" | sort | uniq
| /bin
| /home/davep/bin
| /sbin
| /usr/X11R6/bin
| /usr/bin
| /usr/games
| /usr/local/bin
| /usr/local/plt/bin
| /usr/sbin
`----

none of those directories would (should) ever contain configuration files.

So if you say I can retrieve the two (or x) CVS tree with one

Yes, but this can also be the reverse. So some contrib author 
could be afraid to stay alone (or very few) within the new CVS 
project. At least that could confirm we must keep a common list for 
a while.

Hi Luiz,

I'm playing with hbdoc but:

1) if I do hbdoc /txt math.txt I get

2) Then I used hbdoc /htm math.txt and:
    a) all *defaults* text like syntax are in English :(
    b) The $CATEGORY$ is *Matemáticas* and hbdoc
        generate a name "hbmatem" and should

Thanks for your attention!

Subject: [Harbour] [OT] Basic cvs question
Message-ID: <01Jul19.111936clt.117242@vpn.sonda.com>

Hello everyone,

This question is not related to Harbour, but since there are a
lot of people using cvs here, I think somebody might be able to
give me a hand.

We have an internal linux server running cvs, and most of the clients
connecting to it are WinNT/Win2K machines running the command-line
cvs client (I use linux myself, and that of course works fine). All
of those clients work with cvs seamlessly.

The problem: a new user is trying to set up his Win95 machine to
work as a cvs client. He installed the client downloaded from

  http://www.cvshome.org/downloads.html

and is able to login and checkout a working copy. However, when
he changes directories to anywhere within the working copy, and
issues any command (such as "cvs update ."), he gets this message:

  cvs update: nothing known about .

Again, this is from a fresh working copy, on any directory! I get
the feeling that, for some reason, the cvs client is unable to
read the administrative files stored under CVS/*, that would allow
it to learn where the server lives, etc. We have verified that going
to the original checkout directory, and doing another "cvs checkout"
(complete with the "-d :pserver:...") does work and, for instance,
shows what files (if any) have been modified in the working copy.

The question: since I assume some users here are accessing the Harbour
repository with the command-line cvs client running on a Win95 machine,
to those users I ask: do you see this problem? Do you know of any
work-arounds?

Thanks for any input, and apologies for asking this off-topic question.

Access to CVS shouldn't really be seen as membership of a community, or vice
versa.

Further to this, I just remembered that I'd written code to generate "dot
file" names when I write Expert Guide for GNU/Linux (and DJGPP under DOS,
hence the #ifdef you'll see in the code).

The code to generate the name of such a file could be:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
#include <pwd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

char *home_directory( void )
{
    static char szHomeDir[ _POSIX_PATH_MAX ] = "";

    if ( !*szHomeDir )
    {
        char *pszHome = getenv( "HOME" );

        if ( pszHome )
        {
            strcpy( szHomeDir, pszHome );
        }
        else
        {
            struct passwd *pw = getpwuid( getuid() );

            strcpy( szHomeDir, pw->pw_dir );
        }
    }

    return( szHomeDir );
}

int make_home_dot_file( char *name, char *buffer )
{
    char *home = home_directory();
    int  ok    = 0;

    if ( home && *home )
    {
        sprintf( buffer,
#ifdef DJGPP
                 _use_lfn( NULL ) ? "%s/.%s" : "%s/_%s",
#else
                 "%s/.%s",
#endif
                 home, name );

        ok = 1;
    }

    return( ok );
}
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

Here's some example use:

,----
| davep@hagbard:~/temp$ tail -18 foo.c
| int main( void )
| {
|     char dot_file[ _POSIX_PATH_MAX ];
| 
|     printf( "My home directory is %s\n", home_directory() );
| 
|     if ( make_home_dot_file( "harbourrc", dot_file ) )
|     {
|         printf( "My config file might be %s\n", dot_file );
|     }
|     else
|     {
|         printf( "Err?\n" );
|     }
| 
|     return( 0 );
| }
| 
| davep@hagbard:~/temp$ ./foo
| My home directory is /home/davep
| My config file might be /home/davep/.harbourrc
|
| davep@hagbard:~/temp$ HOME=/home/wibble ./foo

Go to http://www.harbour-project.org/ and click on the Download button.
Then download the build 37 source code ZIP file (all platforms that are
supported by Harbour build from the exact same source tree).

My guess is that he doesn't have HOME, HOMEDRIVE, and HOMEPATH set.

Look for an file called genhtm.lnk and genhtm.rsp on the /doc dir of
harbour. the first one tell witch file to process.
The second one specifie the format of the .ng and .hlp output

and dont pass an file name to hbdoc
try the follow

on your doc dir use
hbdoc /rtf
process all files int he doc dir
hbdoc /rtf genhtm.lnk genhtm.rsp use the information of genhtm.lnk to some
info and only process the files listed i genhtm.rsp

Hope this help

I ask because you wrote:

* location for harbour. Also consider supporting ~/.harbourrc. */

If it is a directory I will add it to the search list. See below.

Let me explain how it works now for linuxers: it searchs the PATH in
WinTel platforms but to make if more flexible in Linux the szEnv var now
is defined as:

#elif defined( OS_UNIX_COMPATIBLE )
   pszEnv = "/etc:/usr/local/etc"; /* QUESTION: Add "~/.harbourrc." ? */
#endif

Now pszEnv is passed to hb_searchpath() where we check if harbour.cfg
exists anywhere in the given path:

* "currentdir"
* "/etc/harbour.cfg"
* "/usr/local/etc/harbour.cfg"

I hope it is clear now ;->

No, it would be a file. It could be ~/.harbour.cfg if you like (ending in
"rc" is a convention that many programs follow, but not all). IOW, it's the
name of the config file. In case you don't know, "~" is shell shorthand for
"home directory":

,----
| davep@hagbard:~$ echo ~
| /home/davep
| davep@hagbard:~$ echo ~root
| /root
| davep@hagbard:~$ echo ~samba
| /home/samba
`----

The closing full stop (dot, period, etc...) was the end of the sentence, not
part of the suggested filename.

> #elif defined( OS_UNIX_COMPATIBLE )

As I've said elsewhere, searching each of the common etc directories isn't
the common thing to do but, at the same time, I can see no real harm in it.

1. Did this ever work for you before? From compiler source it seems this was

Subject: [Harbour] Differences between 16 & 32 bit
Message-ID: <3B5732F9.A175C5D6@corevia.com>

Hi,
this piece of code GPF's with BCC32:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MY_CHAR   ';'

void main( void )
{
   char * pszDelim = ( char * ) MY_CHAR;
   printf( strtok( "This;is;a;test", pszDelim ) );
}

I know it comes from the typecast but I'm not sure how to typecast ';'
to ";" ?

It would be nice to know the results with another 32 bit compilers.

It can't be done. You have to build a string. For example:

#define MY_CHAR ';'
...
	char my_string =3D {MY_CHAR, '\0'};

Or if you have to build it on the fly:

#define MY_CHAR ';'
...
	char my_string[2];
...
	my_string[0] =3D MY_CHAR;
	my_string[1] =3D '\0';

I'm no C expert but I don't think you can type cast a char to (char *)

I think you can achieve this goal with something like:

   sprintf( pszDelim, "%c", MY_CHAR );

But you would have to allocate the required space to pszDelim before passing
it to sprintf().

Which is wrong, of course. It needs to be:

char my_string[2] = {MY_CHAR, '\0'};

It hasn't posed much of a problem for perl, python or php to name a

My point of view? The longer you leave them together, the harder 
they will be to pry apart. The sooner you set up the separation, the 
easier it will be to differientate where changes belong.

Your definitive statement "This is a bug in harbour." is inaccurate. Your
agreement that the importance of the issue is debatable, is accurate.

Intended behavior by-definition can *not* be a bug.

100% correct. Please note that your report did *not* raise a question,
rather it expressed a definitive statement. Your arrival at such conclusion
was premature IMO.

You made a *definitive* *statement*. Could you kindly explain how could
"This is a bug in harbour." (one complete paragraph in your original post),
be taken out of context? What other context can/did it have? You did not say
'some people may consider it a bug'. You did not give any hint, that it
might *not* be a bug, if some agreement is reached. In fact, you didn't
qualify the above statement, in any form or shape. It had no context, other
than you making this claim as if it was a fact (which it wasn't).

Calling into question your self made determination, that this was a bug
(when in fact it was not), does not equal discomfort discussing possible
negative side effects of my code. In all honesty the bulk of this issue is
*not* at all my code. I sure hope others will not read into your statement,
as if I was the originator of Harbour's Macro Compiler, because I'm *not*.
Ryszard deserves all such credit.

Seeing as I have contributed significant pieces of code, to this open source
project, I'd have hoped that you'd know better. Seeing as I rush to fix, any
reported bug, especially if related to my contributions, I'd have hoped you
know better. Seeing, as I must have fixed hundreds of reported bugs, and
this is the first time I refuted such report, I'd have hoped you know
better. Finally, seeing as not a single member of this group agreed with
your definition of Harbour's Macro superiority as being a "bug", I'd have
hoped you know better.

I never speculated about your reasons, which I'm confident were well
intended. This doesn't impact on the limited view, reflected by such
premature self made determination. Normally you do raise question, this time
you may have meant to, but instead you contributed a definitive statement,
pretending to state a fact.

As you should know, my "inaccurate..." and "narrow..." were in reply to
"This is a bug in harbour." in <20010718113506.T1518@hagbard.davep.org> and
not <20010718095949.M1518@hagbard.davep.org> to which I said "I couldn't
disagree more!". This bug statement *is* inaccurate, *does* make a claim,
and *is* indeed an assertion (unwarranted as such).

There was no other context. This statement was a decisive, clear, and self

Your first report asked: "Doesn't this fix mean that there incompatibility
that Ryszard documented still exists?" To which I replied "I couldn't
disagree more!" I further explained that there are numerous instances of
related incompatibilities, resulting from the many improvements in Harbour's
Macro Compiler. To which you replied:

"
I'm not reporting bugs to the developer's of CA-Clipper, I'm reporting a bug
to the developers of harbour. Harbour is supposed to be a free software
CA-Clipper compatible compiler and I've posted an instance of valid
CA-Clipper code having an entirely different outcome in harbour.

This is a bug in harbour.
"

The above does *not* solicit any information. It does *not* ask any
question. It does *not* attempt to mention any possible positive aspect. It
*does* make a definitive, unconditional, statement. It *does* pretend to
state a fact.

While it was not in your original message, it *was* indeed the thrust of
your second message.

I'm happy to discuss any aspect of this issue. Could you please quote any

You may insist that is a meta-problem and I'll have to insist it isn't.
There are literally dozens of syntax incompatibilities between Harbour and
Clipper macro compilers. In my reply to your original report, I did post a
sample that hinted just how many more of this breed of "bugs" Harbour has
(none of which I developed). You indeed acknowledged it as: "Good point,
another example of incompatibility, and less obvious than the one I pointed
out.". So I'm puzzled why you would consider this an issue of me defending
my code. I'm only responsible for one single such enhancement. In the
context of this issue (macro compiler incompatibilities) my code is even
less than *negligent*. I'm just as puzzled as to your claim about my "tone".
I did not use any tone, I did not use any offensive terms, and I completely
ignored your "don't be silly" remark. I have no interest, nor willingness to
bring this into personal territories.

Who's feelings your "This is a bug in harbour." do represent? I'm glad to
know you don't feel that way, but your definitive statement, and lack of
reference to any 3rd party, did *not* leave any room for a doubt, that this
was indeed how you felt.

As I said before I was glad to learn this was not how you feel. I see no
reason in arguing this any more since it obviously became a moot point.

I never doubted we speak about Harbour. I refuted your claim of it being a
bug in Harbour, and I thought you now agree it is not, but the above leaves
me confused. Please clarify: Do you consider Harbour's Macro Compiler
incompatibilities with Clipper, *bugs*, yes or no?

So in the documentation of your software, these are reported as "known
bugs"? Could you point me to any product (yours or otherwise) with
references to *intended* behavior under "known bugs"? Isn't a bug,
by-definition, an issue that should be fixed?

Sorry, I can't discuss an item I know nothing about.

Here is FOLDOC definition of bug:

An unwanted and unintended property of a program or piece of hardware,
especially one that causes it to malfunction. Antonym of feature. E.g.
"There's a bug in the editor: it writes things out backwards." The
identification and removal of bugs in a program is called "debugging".

I'm confident this is *the* definition most commonly used by programmers.
You might want to reconsider your position, or else you are likely to be
surrounded by infinite supply of suspects.

My report asked questions, it didn't make statements. I suggest you go back
and read my report. Note, the report isn't the message where you keep taking
one line out of context.

It was tied up with the preceding paragraph. Go read it again and you'll see
what I'm talking about.

I'm not calling into question your CV in regards to harbour so I'm not sure
why you feel the need to document it here. That you take part in a free
software project isn't being debated.

Go and read the original report, look at how it is a question. Look at the
"statement" you've taken out of context, notice that I'm pointing out that
I'm talking about "harbour", not "Xbase" or "CA-Clipper". Note that there's
nothing narrow about this.

Correct, I'm pointing out that I'm not talking about CA-Clipper, I'm talking
about harbour. If "bug" is a word that causes you concern (and given the
amount of text you're throwing out about it, it seems it does) then place
something in there that makes you happy. Try any of these for warmer
feeling:

  This is a report about harbour.
  This is a query about harbour.
  This is a perceived bug in harbour.

etc. Take your pick, be happy.

Note, however, that the report was a "bug report". Submitting a "bug report"
shouldn't be seen as the cause for branding someone has having a "narrow
point of view".

Please don't start insulting me my claiming that I'm pretending things as
well. Please don't persist in trying to tell me what I think. Try to be less
aggressive Ron.

Only if you take the sum of my input to be that one line. It seems important
to you that this happen. Curious. I'm not sure what or whose purpose that
serves. Try, if you can, to take all of my input on this subject as the sum
of my input and you might find that what I was saying is very different from
what you would have liked me to have been saying.

What's really quite worrying about all of this is that, despite my
clarifying my position, you persist in trying to get me to take
responsibility for your take on what I was saying. You still refuse to
accept that you're taking one line out of context, looking at it in total
isolation, and assuming that it's the sum total of my query. A less
reasonable person might see this as dishonesty.

Lumping me in with those who "see it from this very limited perspective"
suggests otherwise. Bug or not, that statement assumes an awful lot about
the thought, the testing, the double testing and the motivation behind me
raising the issue.

That I felt that it might be a bug but, more importantly, that I was talking
about harbour, not about any other language. You obviously have to read that
line along with the proceeding paragraph for it to make sense.

Yes and no, actually. It depends if I'm considering Clipper compatibility or
not. Overall, no, but you knew that already.

No, I fixed the bugs. Why wouldn't I?

Not at the moment, but I've see software (especially free software, which is
usually very honest about this sort of thing) that lists intended
incompatibilities (for example) as known bugs. The point being that the
incompatibility is intended behaviour but the author sees it as a bug that
needs to be fixed. A grep of various GNU man pages should probably turn up a
few instances (I'll have a look and see if I can pull a couple out for you).

Of course it's an issue that should be fixed. That something needs to be
fixed says nothing about it being intentional or not.

Intended behaviour on the part of the designer/developer can have unintended
consequences once the program is in it's intended environment. When I say
that intended design or intended behaviour can be a bug I do so within the
bounds of the FOLDOC definition (it probably won't surprise you that I'm
well aware of the foldoc definition, it actually being the Jargon File
definition, both are installed in my dictd <URL:http://www.dict.prg/>).

Either way, if my use of the term "bug" offends you (even though you're
taking my words out of context and then using them to make a position for me
that I don't actually hold) then feel free to pretend that I didn't say it.
It's the questions I raised that were important, the position you've
invented for me isn't important to me at all. Do whatever makes you happy.

Ron,

Please, next time you want to change some pCode, could you just 
ask everybody here if they are prepared (or even able :-(( ) to fully 
recompile their APP.

I have here some lib wich are not mine and I'm now seriously 
slowed down within my work on Harbour just because I have to wait 
the lib owner to come back from hollydays :-((

In the meantime I'm working on an older version. :-(

I've said this before, I think it needs saying again. Harbour, in CVS,
should be treated as *highly* unstable. It's the development sources, it's
like you're taking a snapshot of a developer's hard drive as and when you
see fit. You have to expect the content of CVS to change in interesting ways
at any moment.

Imagine that you'd been pulling the source, every couple of hours, during
the development of Clipper 5.0, or 5.2, or 5.3. You would have expected
things to change in interesting and possibly troublesome ways, why expect
any different of harbour?

> In the meantime I'm working on an older version. :-(

Which makes sense. Why the sad face? If people are supporting applications
out there "in the field" they should be sticking with a known good release.
If you need fixes to that known good release this probably says more about
harbour's failure to back-fix obvious problems in stable releases (we tagged
the 0.37 sources for a reason, right?) than it does about Ron's willingness
to enhance harbour.

In summary: Don't expect stability in the CVS sources. Harbour's development
shouldn't be held back because of people's inability to build their
applications, those people should make sure they archive stable versions of
harbour so they can support their applications. Apply important fixes to
their stable snapshot is highly encouraged.

Or, put another way, if Ron had sought the permission you suggest he should
have sought, what would you have expected the harbour project to do when the
answer came back negative? Hold off development until this developer comes
back from his holidays? That could get very tedious very quickly.

I'm very very sorry, that you are faced with this situation. :-(

J.F., please understand that when I proceed to fix a bug, the solution of
which required the pcode change, it has higher priority than this kind of
consideration. Plus I had no way of knowing such, because there was no such
notice. When I go on vacation I always post a notice.

Please note this is a fairly small price to pay. considering you are using
the very latest code of an alpha product, direct from CVS. Just like you I
don't have infinite time, and when I have the time, energy, and clear idea
how to proceed, I can not afford to stop, for a reason like this. Especially
if I don't even know.

Again sorry for the inconvenience. I hope that some time in the future the
ability of using a macro of an argument list, will save you back the time
you now lost.

Ron

For the sake of cleanliness could one of the GNUmake hackers possibly add a
null "install" target in the tests directory's Makefile? If this is done I
can finally remove the "-i" from the call to make in the install section of
the harbour RPM.

Message-ID: <20010720103435.Q18290@hagbard.davep.org>

I'm not sure if anyone has played with hbmake under GNU/Linux so I thought
I'd do something testing (if anyone has done any testing down that route
shout now). But, I've just realised, I'm not at all sure how it's supposed
to work.

Simply running hbmake (as built by the harbour GNUmake build system) drops
me right back to the shell prompt, no offer of help or anything.

What should I be expecting to see? Are there any docs kicking about?

I'm not asking anyone to engage in a long discussion, I'm simply pointing
out that harbour development can't be dictated by some 3rd party developer's
holiday plans. I'm also saying that people supporting applications built
with harbour should ensure that they've got a stable harbour available at
all times.

Because the compiler translate it (it does the same
on some others too) into a specific opcode and not into 
a general function call opcode.

The reason for that is to increase the execution speed,
because there is no need to build a stack frame, etc...

Personally I don't like that way, though I understand
that Nantucket was trying to achieve the highest execution
speed. They did an estimation of the most used functions,
and turned them into specific opcodes.

My apologies, that was the cause of the problem. Somehow I'd managed to
loose my $HB_GT_LIB setting in my build environment. Now, with that set to a
sensible value, when I run hbmake I get a help dump.

  Does this mean that the evaluation of a string "1,23" will give 
different results in the following code?

cMacro := "1,23"

someVar := &cMacro
SomeFun( &cMacro )
SomeFun( someVar:=&cMacro )

How many arguments will be passed to a function in the last case?

You feed back on this is really apreciable, I´m an under an win98 box, so
their probaly can be some Issues that i could not add to the linux version.
Yesterday,Maurilio reported some problem with  hbmake under OS/2 witch was
imediataly handle.

Hbmake with out any parameters should show an help screen

Thanks , i´ll apply the patch and commit later today.
Also has you tried makefile creation/ execution under the linux box.
also when you are executing an makefile can you send the result of the
interval variable by running with -b

My pleasure.

> Also has you tried makefile creation/ execution under the linux box. 

Not yet, I've noticed that there are a few interface issues that need
sorting out (low end and high end graphic characters don't work too well in
a terminal). I've been downloading the latest DJGPP so I can get harbour
building on a DOS machine so that I can see what hbmake's interface should
look like with a view to suggesting some portability fixes for your extended
GET classes.

Once all of that is working I'll probably try actually creating a makefile
or two.

Will do. If I appear to have things working and I don't do this feel free to
shout at me until I do.

Martin,

one more issue to consider:

inside ct.c you have a few functions with variable lenght parameter list. On
GCC/EMX last known parameter has to be of a type which cannot be promoted to
something bigger.

So your USHORT uiArgCount won't work here. You should change them to ULONG
ulArgCount.

regards.

When building with DJGPP I noticed an error about MAXGETHOSTNAME being

Might the attached patch be a good idea?

With regard to the different results question, naturally yes. Macro is
always subject to such variations (error/validity), based on the context of
its usage. Much like it always produced different results with this code:

cMacro := "1"

SomeVar := &cMacro
&cMacro := SomeVar

As to your point with regard to <SomeFun( someVar:=&cMacro )>, I was just
reviewing these kind of scenarios myself too. It is fixed with: 2001-07-20

Thanks for the info, please let me know if you find any other syntax that
produces invalid HB_P_MACROPUSHARG.

Ron

Yes, I know you didn't, I was not trying to suggest you did. Since you

Answered numerous times before. I'm confident those interested in this

I never said your original report was inaccurate. It was your reply to my
explanation, and answer to your question, that was inaccurate, unilateral,
and definitive statement, that I considered coming from a narrow point of
view. As said numerous times before, this one line definitive statement, was
a complete self contained paragraph. The preceding paragraph was quoted too,
and brings no other context to light.

You know very well there is nothing in the preceding paragraph that would
make anyone believe that there was any other context in place. In hopes of
finality I am reposting it here again:

"
I'm not reporting bugs to the developer's of CA-Clipper, I'm reporting a bug
to the developers of harbour. Harbour is supposed to be a free software
CA-Clipper compatible compiler and I've posted an instance of valid
CA-Clipper code having an entirely different outcome in harbour.

This is a bug in harbour.

Then what was it you meant to say with this:

"I'd have hoped you'd be willing to put your code up for peer review
without branding people's feedback as coming from an narrow point of view"

Does it not question my willingness to put my code for peer review? Does it
not suggest that upon negative input from such peer review I'm likely to
brand people's feedback as coming from narrow point of view? What was it you
meant to say exactly?

You asked a question that hints as to the expected answer, you got a
definite answer, expressing and explaining disagreement with the position
expressed in the question. You responded to that with a statement that did
*not* invite any input, did *not* open any discussion, did *not* ask any
question, and did not even hint, that this might not be a bug pending any
kind of agreement, further review, etc.

There was never any question, that you referred to harbour and not Clipper.
What does this have to do with the fact that you decided without proper
review and/or discussions, that this was a bug?

Let's reverse the rolls:

If "inaccurate" and "narrow point of view" are terms that causes you concern
(and given the amount of text you're throwing out about it, it seems it
does) then place something in there that makes you happy. Try any of these
for warmer feeling:

   This is a concern about your labeling of a perceived problem as a bug,
especially you being the FAQ maintainer.
   This is a concern about your labeling of a perceived problem as a bug,
without it being properly discussed.
   This is a concern about your labeling of a perceived problem as a bug,
even after being advised such is just a minute instance of a much greater
issue, that was well accepted by the group.

Rather then play this card (when you know no insult was meant), why would
you not address the issue instead, and maybe acknowledge that your
definition was indeed premature, inaccurate, and indeed failed to express
any consideration to the many other views that should have been considered?

I didn't say you were pretending anything. I did say your definitive
statement pretended to state a fact. Believe me, I'm doing my very best
trying to not come across as aggressive. I do so in the hope of not
expanding the issue and waste even more time than needed to address the
issues we already have open.

The sum of your input have been:

   1. Sample code demonstrating a clear incompatibility that should be a
given (given the documented enhanced capabilities of HMC).
   2. Question suggesting you consider the problem an extension of what
Ryszard reported, and later reported was fixed.
   3. Definitive statement labeling the problem a bug, in reply to my answer
and explanation to point 2.

Did you at *any* *point* *prior* to me describing the above as based on
"narrow point of view" express *any* *input* suggesting that this should be
gain/loss judgment call? Did you express anything suggesting this might
indeed be the desire of the group?

I have no interest in distorting what you have been saying. Curious what
gain you think I might find in that? My only objective is for you to take
reasonability of the words you did indeed write, agree they were inaccurate,
single sided, and premature (because they were), so we can move on.

Less reasonable person might have been more concerned with your repeating
attempts to inject some non existing context retroactively, rather than
simply saying:

'sorry, I didn't mean to close the door on discussing this issue so early.
It's clear that the problem I reported is a reasonable and expected price to
pay, given the intended enhancements, and should not have been described a
bug.'

I never lumped you with anything. Since you are the very person who
attempted to explain to me, that qualified statements in a specific limited

How could you fix an intended behavior? I'm completely lost, how do you fix
something the does exactly what you want it to do?

How could an intended behavior be fixed? Please explain how could we for
instance support Pre/Post Increments/Decrements (++Var) in macro, and
somehow fix the incompatibility it causes at the same time? I would love to
find out.

We must be having a huge misunderstanding here. Please consider the
following code:

   cGoodInput := "FIELD->Total == 100"
   cBadInput  := "FIELD->Total -= 100"

   LIST ALL FOR &c*Input

Now please explain, how do you fix the obvious incompatibility with Clipper
("bug"), while *maintaining* the *intended* behavior (that is to *do*
support '-=' in macros)?

My point is that intended behavior can *not* be fixed, because a fix would
mean it didn't do what it was meant to do before such fix. This of course
conflicts with our agreement that it already did act as intended before such
fix. ???

But we never reduced "works as intended" to anything less than its only true
meaning. It should be clear that "works as intended" must meet with all the
design specs period! We never agreed that there is *anything* unintended in
the behavior of the Harbour Macro Compiler, including environments or any
other aspects, because we do agree that it conforms to the design specs of
its author.

I never invented any position for you, and I can't pretend such. Maybe you
are willing to pretend that I wrote the following to you, and see how it
feels:

``Either way, if my use of the terms "inaccurate" or "narrow point of view"
offends you, due to your determination to ignore the validity of my reasons,
my repeated clarifications, and even requests to not take it offensively,
then feel free to pretend that I didn't say it.

It's the concern about the language you used to communicate your input, that
was important, the position you've invented for me isn't important to me at
all. Do whatever makes you happy.''

Doesn't feel right, does it?

I take it you're asking about the "inline DATA" thing about? It wouldn't
appear to be possible. Why try and use "inline DATA" and not an "inline
METHOD"?

This:

,----
| Class Test
| 
|    Data a Init 0
|    Data b Init 0
|    Method HasFocus Inline ::a==0 .or. ::b >::a
| 
| EndClass
`----

Seems to work fine.

By making it do exactly what the beta tester wants it to do, or what the

on.

You can't do both, that's not what I'm suggesting so I don't know why you'd
try and make out that I am. Besides, what you describe there isn't a bug
anyway.

Subject: [Harbour] 5.3 compatability and harbour being able to build harbour
Message-ID: <20010721085003.R3686@hagbard.davep.org>

This might not be an issue but I thought I'd raise it just in case.

Correct me if I'm wrong but the 5.3 extensions are an optional part of
harbour. You have to set a define "switch" and rebuild harbour (or, at
least, the RTL?).

hbmake got me wondering about utilities that are part of harbour and might
rely on 5.3 extensions in the RTL. From what I can see, at the moment,
hbmake doesn't. But, if/when the controls are moved into the RTL it would
seem reasonable to remove any redundancy. However, if that were done we'd
have a utility that might not be able to be built with harbour. Part of
harbour couldn't then be built by itself.

Like I say, I'm not sure this is the case right now but I can see that it
could possibly be a problem. Perhaps something worth keeping in mind?

Thinking about it, seeing as how 5.3 compatibility is the default anyway,
perhaps this:

,----
| #ifndef HB_COMPAT_C53
|    #error Harbour built with 5.3 compatibility is required to build hbfoo
| #endif
`----

will be good enough for such utilities?

Thoughts?

Subject: [Harbour] Making harbour utils terminal capability aware
Message-ID: <20010721083929.Q3686@hagbard.davep.org>

I seem to recall that there was some discussion about this many moons ago
but I can't recall if there was any outcome. Is there a mechanism in harbour
that allows a programmer to make their program terminal capability aware?

What I'm thinking about here is the (in)ability to display low end and high
end "graphic" characters. Case in point: The radio button control that's
used in hbmake uses a diamond as the "filler". In an xterm here on my box
(an instance of rxvt actually) it gets drawn as "^D". So, instead of looking
like (using "O" for a diamond) "(O)" it looks like "(^D".

Also, the box around the border of the screen is various Latin1 characters,
not box drawing lines.

On my GNU/Linux console the filler is rendered as a question mark inside a
filled in circle. The border comes out correctly.

Doubtless there are other environments in which I'll get different effects.

So, I'm wondering about two things here. First, is there or can there be any
generic method of dealing with this problem? Second, if there can't, might
it be a good idea to do one of two things:

o Don't use "graphic" characters in harbour utilities.

o Provide a function for working out the environment that we're running in
  so the programmer can make a runtime decision. Perhaps HB_OSType() or
  something with a set of constants for known working environments (or do we
  have something that will serve that purpose?).

I'm also wondering, as an aside, if we could/should have the ability to
SET() the standard SINGLE and DOUBLE box drawing strings. This will also be
an issue if/when the radio button control is part of the RTL.

Thoughts?

Even if both are valid in OS/2, this is not valid in others OS

In order to use the same code in OS/2 and Win98, I added code in order to
deal with differences in OS/2:

// Mientras corrigen Harbour para OS/2
// cSvrEjec := DISKNAME()+":\"+CURDIR()+"\"
cSvrEjec := CURDIR()
cSvrEjec := STRTRAN( cSvrEjec, "/", "\" )
IF LEFT( cSvrEjec,1 ) == "\"
 cSvrEjec := SUBS( cSvrEjec, 2 )
ENDI
cSvrEjec := DISKNAME()+":\"+cSvrEjec+"\"

The code    IF LEFT( cSvrEjec,1 ) == "\"   remain since an old error in
CURDIR():Harbour for OS/2, which now is fixed, but remain the foward slash
management

Using backslash, is sufficient in both OS the line:
      cSvrEjec := DISKNAME()+":\"+CURDIR()+"\"
as I use in Clipper

No, but this is the perfect place for an Access

> DATA b init 0
> ACCESS HasFocus inline ::a==0 .or. ::b >::a
> endclass

Just for info, the Assign counter part could be somethink like ;

ASSIGN HasFocus(LFocus) inline iif(lFocus,::SetFocus(),,), ::a==0 
.or. ::b >::a 

You can define either an Access or an Assign without counterpart. 
In your sample, don't try to assign any value to Hasfocus else you 
would receive a RunTime error 'Message Not Found 
oObj:_HasFocus ..."

The follow class is an standart class definition

Class Foo
Data nRow as0
Data nCol as 0
Data Caption as ""
Method New(nRow,nCol,cCaption)
Method Display()
endclass

method New(nRow,nCol,cCaption)
::nRow:=nRow
::nCol:=nCol
::Caption:=cCaption
Return Self

Method Display()
devpos(::nRow,::nCol)
Devout(::cCaption)
return Self

Now , Does the class above can be writed as this. I think that the method
below can add new capabilities to the Harbour class engine

Class FOO(Row,Col,cCaption)
Data nRow as if(Row!=nil,row,0)
Data nCol as  if(Col!=nil,col,0)
Data Caption as if(cCaption!=nil,cCaption,"")
Method Display()
endclass

Method Display()
devpos(::nRow,::nCol)
Devout(::cCaption)
return Self

So to instanciate an object, you have to call

oMyObj := Foo():New(10,10,"Hello World")

and to use it

oMyObj:Display()

And here you would like to write

oMyObj := Foo(10,10,"Hello World"):New()
 ...

Not sure where the benefit is ;-)

Doing such a modification would add another variant to the OO 
syntax and I really think we already has enough.

Also, From my point of view, we should not pass any parameters 
to the class itself.

Insted  of using oMyObj :=Foo(10,10,"Hello World"):New()
OMyObj:Display()

Use oMyObj:Foo(10,10,"Hello World")
oMyObj:Display()

At least this is the way that Ca-Clipper 5.3

I'm reviewing 2 more classes of operators, comparisons and math. In the
process of re-reading the code of expression optimizer I encountered few
questions:

1. Why do you use hb_compExprSetOperand() which is always used like this:

      NumValue     PLUSEQ Expression   { $$ = hb_compExprSetOperand(
hb_compExprNewPlusEq( $1 ), $3 ); }

   instead of doing something like:

     NumValue     PLUSEQ Expression   { $$ = hb_compExprNewOpEq( $1, $3,
HB_EO_PLUSEQ ); }

   and:

     Expression '-' Expression     { $$ = hb_compExprNewOpMath( $1, $3,
HB_EO_MINUS ); }

   etc., etc. It appears the above approach would have saved numerous of
functions all essentially identical, wouldn't it?

2. It appears that further optimization could be, to actually use something
like HB_EO_COMPARE, with a single handler, and have a subtype like
HB_EO_COMP_LE, HB_EO_COMP_GE, etc,. This will again appear to remove
redundancy between hb_compExprUseEQ() hb_compExprUseLT() hb_compExprUseGT()
hb_compExprUseLE() etc., which appear to be essentially identical.

Is there something I'm missing here? Will greatly appreciate your input.

Ron

Are you sure it is not some function wrapper around the real object 
instanciation ? (Not checked !!! )

Something like you could do with the class Foo;

Function InstFoo(Row,Col,cCaption)
Return Foo():New(Row,Col,cCaption)

What would a different instantiation syntax give us? Note that we'd still
need to define NEW() methods (constructors) for classes that have
non-trivial constructors so what you suggest above doesn't seem to do away
with constructors altogether.

What's the idea behind the suggestion? What are the new capabilities that
you had in mind? What capabilities would it add that we don't have now?

  Please notice that in the above examples the macro is used in 'value' 
context thus it should return a value. The code that can return more then 
one value is not usual in programming (it is implemented in Icon only, 
IIRC). This can generate many side effects that are outside of the 
programmer control.

  This is not comparable with the above.

  Well, although I don't agree with the whole change then I have changed 
the expression optimiser to remove the exceptions from the code 
generation flow. Please do not create exceptions to the exceptions where 
the self contained solution exists.

  Notice also that your solution still doesn't solve the source of this 
addition:
LIST &macro
will not solve the problem (the list of database fields) because it is 
preprocessed into the array of codeblocks. During evaluation of codeblock 
only the last item will be displayed.

that's exactly how C53 does it. It doesn't has a "real" constructor
method, it only has a wrapper which "builds" the object calling the
undocumented __ClassXXX functions.

How would the constructor get called? How would it allow for alternate
constructors?

Doesn't 5.3 simply use wrapper functions, sort of like TBROWSENEW() and the
like?

Beside the point and off topic but other commonly used languages I've used
that can do this are Common Lisp, perl and python.

  Because these are separate two steps:
-creation of '+=' expression
-passing the right side of the expression 

  This allows to create the '+=' expression when the right side is not 
defined yet. hb_compExprSetOperand() is aware of operator precedence 
while hb_compExprNewPlusEq() is a dumb creator only. Again this allows to 
create expressions with no source code (see optimisation of _GET_ 
function)

  HB_EO_PLUSEQ is internal data used in the expression optimiser. This 
allows to change internal representation of expressions with almost no 
changes in bison rules. 
  Unfortunately some internal data used by the expression optimiser are 
made public to allow compilation both in the compiler an the macro and to 
split code into smaller pieces. This means that their use outside of the 
expresion optimiser are not recommended.

  Such rules were causing that the bison parser was overflowing its 
internal state buffers.

  Yes, it can save some code but will decrease code maintability and

1. I'm not sure I understand your point.

   Line# 1 <someVar := &cMacro> will produce a '&' syntax error because the
use of a list of arguments in this context is incorrect. Just like Harbour
will produce a compile error on <someVar := 1,23>.

   Line# 2 <SomeFun( &cMacro )> will call SomeFun() with 2 parameters 1 and
23. Just like Harbour will treat <SomeFun( 1, 23 )>

   Line# 3 <SomeFun( someVar:=&cMacro )> will produce a '&' syntax error for
the exact same reasons specified for Line# 1.

2. Every macro is value isn't it? And indeed it does return a value, if the
context accept this kind of value, or error if it doesn't. Much like the
value of 1 in my example was not appropriate for an LValue.

I'm not familiar with Icon, but surely you must know that it is implemented
in dBase, FoxPro, FlagShip, and probably other xBase dialects.

I'm not sure what side effects you are referring to. Please note this kind
of macro context has been used in most xBase dialects for ever.

> > SomeVar := &cMacro
> > &cMacro := SomeVar
>
>   This is not comparable with the above.

I think it does, because it demonstrate that the macro compiler can accept
the same exact string in one context or generate an error for same, in
another context. It simply demonstrates that the macro compiler is concerned
not just with the syntax of the macro itself, but also how it fits in the
context from which the macro compiler was called.

Thanks for the improvements and info. Though I must say that you are still
having the same kind of exceptions (which are indeed necessary). The only
difference is that you use a flag in the expression structure rather than a
standalone variable. The logic is still identical. The only reason I didn't
use the internal structure asMacro.SubType was because I didn't [yet] feel
I'm fully aware of possible side effects.

BTW, I agree that these improvements, and your handling of HB_EXPR_USE(
hb_exp_pSelf->value.asFunCall.pFunName, HB_EA_PUSH_PCODE ) is more elegant.

Yes, I'm believe I'm close to having a solution...

Yes, I'm using gtcrs with ncurses. I'll try your suggestion but that doesn't
really address the wider issue. For example, slang can no more display
characters that aren't displayable in a given terminal than ncurses can.

I notice that this:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
Function Main()
Local cMacro := "1, 2"
Local n      := ( &cMacro )

   ? n

Return( NIL )
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

throws an error during macro expansion, even though this:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
Function Main()
Local n := ( 1, 2 )

   ? n

Return( NIL )
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

(the "expanded" version of the above) is valid Clipper code. Should the
macro compiler allow or disallow this example?

A curious aside. When I compile that second example I got an odd warning:

This is, I'm not asking for any warnings.

Subject: [Harbour] Release 4 of harbour 0.37 binary and source RPMs for GNU/Linux
Message-ID: <20010722091845.D3686@hagbard.davep.org>

I've updated the `harbour-link' command in the harbour RPM so that it
correctly supports the user's HB_GT_LIB setting. A user can now affect which
terminal library is linked in by simply setting HB_GT_LIB to their desired
value.

<URL:http://www.davep.org/harbour/harbour.spec> has been updated and I've
uploaded new source and binary RPMs to the upload directory of the ftp site:

,----
| davep@hagbard:~$ ls -lG harbour*.rpm
| -rw-rw-r--    1 davep     1363058 Jul 22 09:06 harbour-0.37-4.i386.rpm
| -rw-rw-r--    1 davep     1434143 Jul 22 09:06 harbour-0.37-4.src.rpm
`----

They will be available as soon as Patrick updates the download page.

Is the same true for HB_LEX?

HB_LEX has nothing to do with linking, that's a compiler building decision,
not a user program linking decision.

  The first example gives syntax error because argument list is allowed 
as a function call parameter and if it is not a part of complex 
expression (expression that uses any operators). The macro is expanded 
during assigning of a value.

  This warning is here to inform you that "1" is ignored in this 
expression. This means that the variable 'n' will be equal to 2.
You will get simmilar warning in the following expression:
 EVAL( {|| someNotIgnoredVar, "IgnoredText", 1, 2} )
The compiler will generate warning for "IgnoredText" and 1.

  No. Every macro will return either LValue or a value (RValue for 
symetry :). This means that it can behave differently in lvalue and 
rvalue context. All three examples are used in rvalue context then it 
should be expected that the same data should always generate the same 
result.

  Are you sure? At least VO was (ver 1.0) not supporting it. Notice that 
LIST &comeVar
can be implemented without macro list expansion then support for this 
command doesn't prove that the macro compiler accepts a list of arguments 
in these xbase dialects.

> I'm not sure what side effects you are referring to. Please note this kind

  Any side effects caused by the increased number of arguments passed to 
a function, something like:
FUNCTION someFun( MacroCanBeHere, VeryImportandSecondParam, 
EvenMoreImportandParam )

Calling such function with &macro as a first argument can cause problems 
with proper handling of parameters. It can be not a big problem if the 
programmer has created such function however it can cause problems when a 
third party function is called.

  See above: lvalue is not the same as rvalue.

  I don't agree that the logic is identical. You have added a global 
variable as an exception for all uses of the macro if it was on the 
function arguments list. Next you have disabled this exception if a macro 
was a part of some complex expressions. This of course was causing 
errorneous code in many syntax that you were not aware of, for example:
SomeFun( &macro, someVar:=&macro ) //no re-entrant solution
SomeFun( {|| &macro} ) //codeblock context
SomeFun( { &macro } ) //array context
SomeFun( !&macro ) //all logical and arithmetic operators

In other words, previously you have created a rule for N cases and next 
you had to disable (N-1) other cases. Now the rule is used in 1 and only 
one case and all (N-1) cases stays not aware about this rule.

  But please do not make any more complex dependencies simmilar to this 
new macro<->hvm dependency. The macro should comunicate with the hvm via 
the eval stack only. The internal structure of the hvm should be exposed 
and used outside of it.

I think that LIST command can be implemented without the macro changes. 
The extended list of fields should be handled inside __dbList() function 
instead on the pcode/hvm level. Why __dblist() cannot tokenize passed 
argument?

   This should be:
The internal structure of the hvm should _not_ be exposed and used 
outside of it.

If the object generation  works on every platform, I can use this new option
to make hbmake a little more fastern. Insted of first generate an C file and
them call the C compiler, i Can call one one time harbour.exe that will
produce the Obj File, and on C dependencies , call the C compiler to
generate the obj file.

I'm not sure I follow here. I know why it's an error in CA-Clipper and I
know why it could reasonably be an error in harbour. What I'm wondering
about is, if Ron's extending harbour to allow for lists in macro expansion
in most circumstances, shouldn't the above be one of those circumstances. If
not, why not?

Oh, right, is the compiler telling me that it totally omitted the value from
the generated code? That said, what I was wondering about was it emitting a
warning at all. For some reason I had it in my mind that harbour would only
displays warnings if I supply the 'w' flag. Is this not the case?

Ok, done, I'm with you now. Yes, the slang GT library makes a much better
job of displaying this stuff (although I'm still wondering about the general
issue).

However (testing with hbmake here), although I get a screen displayed I
can't actually see myself navigating the screen (this is in hbmake's -e
screen), I think it's because the cursor isn't displaying. Also, when the
problem finishes, it seems that it needs to swallow one last key stroke
before it returns control to the shell.

slang version is:

Am I reading this right? Your additions, as well as adding C compiler
"hiding", also finish off the work on producing Win32 OBJ files without the
need for a C compiler?

Or is the above simply noting that the Win32 OBJ generation switch has been
changed?

The difference in context does not have to be limited to LValue/RValue. The
arglist context is a natural extension of the context awareness. Again much
like the use of context with regard to alias, etc.

Yes, I'm sure with regard to dBase and FoxPro. I assume that FlagShip too,
based on hint from recent posted message.

Yes I know. I tried this:

   cMacro := "1,2"
   Test( &cMacro )

   Return

   Function Test( p1, p2 )
      ? PCount(), p1, p2
   Return

And it worked as expected.

This wouldn't be the first or last such impact due to an error. Please note
that my recent '-=' vs. '==' sample, would cause a far worse problem (but is
still well justified).

The rule was only activated in one scenario and disabled in 3-4
subs-scenarios. But you are 100% correct, that its more elegant now.

I have no clue why you arrived at the conclusion the only communication has
to be via the eval stack. It is very limited and extremely slow and
cumbersome, when compared with the way logic is commonly interfaced.

I think I can soon have a solution that will not effect low level interface
to __dblist().

Luiz,

I recommend that you inherit from current TGet class and change the behavior
you want. That is what OOPS is all about.

Please leave TGet as is right now, is working ok and I am really dreaming
for a first release of Harbour. If we change the core parts constantly then
we will never finish it.

BTW is just my desire, that code has my copyright but nothing else.

Antonio,Ignacio

I´m now working to make the CA-Clipper 5.3 classes
(Checkbox,ListBox,RadioBox,PushButton) to  be compatible with harbour. In
order to do this, I need to do some changes on the Current Getsys, to add
the new parameters that the Ca-Cliiper 5.3 Getsys have, and also add the
required data to Tget to be compatible with this Classes.

Any problem to I do the change

OK, if there are not more alternative, I will continue applying to the
result of CURDIR() in Harbour, the change of "/" to "\" to have the same
appearence and management as in Clipper 

The Norton Guide for Clipper 5.3 says:

"CURDIR() returns the current DOS directory of the drive specified by
<cDrivespec> as a character string without either leading or trailing
backslash (\) characters."

so I supposed that in the middle should be "\" characters, as Clipper do,
and not  "/" as Harbour do in OS/2

Gracias,
David Macias

I only added two required Data (Control/Message) to Tget. This was the only
changes i´ve done to tget class. The Principal changes was done inside
getsys.prg/tgetlist.prg so the Get Controls Can be handled right.

Just Tests tests/tstchbx.prg for the get controls i´ve added

I only upload the changes when i fully test them.

The two Datas that i add to TGET dont break the existing Code.

I´ll add the 3 missing Clipper 5.3 Controls (listbox,scrollbar,pushbutton)
later this week, as I soon then them properly.

I also suggest to you the follow test

func main()
local cName:=space(40)
@ 2,2 Say "Name" Get cName Pict "@!"
Atail(getlist):message := "Enter an Name"
Readmodal(getlist,,maxrow(),0,maxcol(),"w/b+")
return Nil

I haven't checked hbmake yet so I don't know yet if this option will

That's because Clipper was DOS-centric.

No, because Harbour is multi-platform and on any platform that uses the
GCC compiler, the path separator character is "/". Even for Cygwin. If
you want an OS/2 version of Harbour that uses "\" for the path
separator, then you'll have to use the ICC version. Or use one of the
Windows GCC platform builds instead of using the BCC32 build to have it
be "/" on both Windows and OS/2.

Ok i´ll do the follow. I´ll make local changes to hbmake to use the
harbour.exe that you provided(the one avaliable on the contrib directory of
the harbour ftp site.) then I´ll do speed tests o both hbmake(the original
one , and the modified one to use direct prg to obj file). then i´ll post my

   * source/rtl/profiler.prg
     * Replace old profile reporting code with an OO approach.

[TODO]

The above code needs to be modified to use the common divisor. The common
divisor function that Antonio submitted first needs to be correctly placed
in the harbour namespace.

A better method of accounting for time needs to be found.

[Aside]

It's the first time in knocking on for two years that I've CVS'd anything
into harbour (the last time I did we weren't even using SourceForge) so if
anyone spots any obvious mistakes I'd appreciate any pointers.

One odd thing did happen while CVSing. Right at the end of the commit run I
got this:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

The cause of the errors are half obvious (the change in the case of the name
of harbour) but I'm not sure if the above is coming from my end or from
SourceForge's end. Is anyone else (presumably with a command line cvs
client) seeing the above?

Looking at the CVS server using the web-cvs interface it seems that my
changes did make it to the server. <confused>

Glad I'm in good company then <g>. Hmm, I guess it is something up on the

Yes, everybody sees it and it is indeed caused by the change in case.
Apparently SourceForge neglected to correct the case in server-side
scripts that are run by CVS.

Luis, I am not a good person to make suggestions about RadioButtons
because I've never used them before (I've never had a chance to run
Clipper 5.3 so far).

But what strikes me is that in hbmake when I press a SpaceBar on an item
which is currently marked, the marker is cleared resulting in no RadioButton
been marked in a group. If this is the case - OK. But is this a way it should
work ?

After testing hbmake under my RH 7.1 I noticed some problems related to
path separators. You seem to use \ instead of / in some places.
Also calling gcc from a generated makefile (hbmake -e) is rather not proper.
You should call it without a path which is default under linux.

$(BCB)/gcc -I$(HB_INC_INSTALL) $(CFLAG1) $(CFLAG2) -I. -o$* $**

seems to not be the proper way.

BTW, maybe it is time to introduce something like hb_osPathSeparator()
and hb_osPathListSeparator() as I suggested a few monts ago ?

Well, I don't think a "general solution" exists at all for problems You
touched in Your original mail, which I signaled many times on this list.
Unix world is too much wild to solve these problems and they are
common to *all* text based applications running under it. Slang tries
its best but for sure does not solve most of them.

So my suggestions are :

- try to do the best emulation which can be done on native consoles (for sure
  the full emulation is not possible)
- concentrate to provide a good work on a terminal emulation program which
  can emulate linux console (do You remember my question about such a
  program on  a harbourtalk list and Your answer about dTelnet ?)
- introduce support for keyboard emulation on real terminals with lack of
  possibilities (gtsln for example uses the idea of DeadKey to help enter
  nation keys, and MetaKey - to simulate ALT+key)
- allow to choose a gt driver during a runtime, because my experiences show
  that some terminals work better with ncurses, some others with slang
- try to avoid pseudographics in harbour utilities (as You suggested)
- try to develop other gt drivers - for example based on vcs devices (under
  linux). They could also try to use a keyboard in a SCANMODE mode
  although this is rather dangerous.
- other ideas which I am not able to think about currently

My first thing I've done before writing to this list was to compile and to run
hbmake with current Harbour from a ftp site. Hbmake runs smoothly here.
Cursor is visible and moves correctly. And there is no need to press a key
when a program finishes to get to a shell, but I am using Slang 1.4.4 since
previous versions had some errors, although not related to cursor visibility.

Please try to compile and run curstst.prg from a test directory and send
me results after running it. Maybe the problem is related to the fact that
Your graphics card does not respond to cursor changing requests from
a kernel ? Kernel assums standard VGA card (in its console.c driver)
when a request to change a cursor appearance is made.

Subject: [Harbour] OO error, Help needed ... :-(((
Message-ID: <200107232108.XAA05562@pyxis.wanadoo.be>

Hi All,

There is a bug within the class system I'm trying to solve wich 
became to give me a serious Headache...

I do need some explanation about the way the VM is actually 
evaluating a function and its parameters.

Just in case of someone's interested, here is a _short_ description 
of the problem;

Suppose you have a class wich inherit some super class.

When you define a method like

Method Create()
 Super:Create(::nX)
Return Self

At runtime, the internal function associated to the Super message 
will do an swapping between the real class handle and the super 
class handle so as the next message will be applied using the 
super message but keeping the good self object. :-/

OK, for those of you always with me ;-) , we can continue ...

The super function is called and the casting is applied (internally, 
my Self object has now its ->ui value setted to the superclass 
handle and ->uiPrevCls contain now the original value.
Then we will try to send the "create" message to the 'casted' object 
so as the 'create' method from the super class would be called and 
applied to the self object.
There hb_VmDo or hb_VmSend will put back the ui value after 
having retrieved the function associated to the message.

As expected, the function params are evaluated _before_ calling 
the 'create' message and there is the problem, because ::nX is in 
fact the message 'nX' sended to the Self object ... wich actually is 
casted, waiting for 'Create' to be called. Now the VM do exactly the 
same as if we had writen Super:nX :-((((((((((((.   

Best regards,

J. Lefebvre,

Luiz,

	Is there any way we could have a bytes-compressed/uncompressed meter?
it seems that it only will do files-compressed/uncompressed now and that
will
make it very hard on users if they a very big file to be
zipped/unzipped...

Thanks my friend.

Sound rasonable, But i think that is Possible .

I think that Patrick has already done this on his wfbackup program.

But I can review the implementation

Agreed, which is why I was wondering about the viability and desirability of
providing a mechanism by which a harbour programmer (IOW, someone
programming with harbour, not someone developing harbour) could override
display behaviour.

I assume you mean cursrtst.prg from the test directory?

All tests done in rxvt under X.

Ok, with ncurses:

,----
| davep@hagbard:~/temp$ ldd cursrtst
|         libm.so.6 => /lib/libm.so.6 (0x4001e000)
|         libncurses.so.4 => /usr/lib/libncurses.so.4 (0x4003b000)
|         libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x4007d000)
|         /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)
`----

I get no cursor for none and a block cursor for all other cursor types.

With slang:

,----
| davep@hagbard:~/temp$ ldd cursrtst
|         libm.so.6 => /lib/libm.so.6 (0x4001e000)
|         libslang.so.1 => /usr/lib/libslang.so.1 (0x4003b000)
|         libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x4009a000)
|         libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x4018f000)
|         /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)
`----

I get exactly the same results as with ncurses, no evidence of the problem
that I spoke of with hbmake.

Hmm, perhaps it's something particular to hbmake or to the controls it uses?
I'll play some more when I get the chance.

Given that I don't have this problem elsewhere, even with slang based stuff
(Expert Guide, mutt, slrn, mc, ...), I'd be surprised if it's that low level
a problem.

There appears to be a warning and an error in the above:

Luiz/Jose,

Here are 2 warnings that from reading the code, appear to be actual
problems, of confusing between <char StringArrayOfChars[x]>, <char
*szString> and <char *ArrayOfStrings[x]>. It seems the code makes invalid
use of the later, instead of <char StringArrayOfChars[]>.

If you compile with /p and check the .ppo file you'll find the above didn't
get pre-processed, and that's because there is no rule supporting this
syntax in hbclass.ch.

I'm not familiar with this syntax, and not sure if this is an omission that
needs to get addressed or not.

Sorry for the delay, I have uploaded them yesterday. I have also
rearranged the files (don't worry, the copyright remained yours - see
file headers) and did some changes in the error handling . Also, I have
added the docs for these functions - that surely needs some correction.
Can someone of the english speaking people please review the docs and
correct it if necessary ?

Regards, and thanks again for your contribution (the mathematical
function section is *finished* now !!)

Message-ID: <LOBBKAFMMFGJIKLMEPAKAELJDOAA.Ron@Profit-Master.com>

Hello J.F.,

I think I have an idea.

First here is what the problem line look to the HVM (in my sample the Super
is class TParent the child is TChild and nX is just named X):

#1	HB_P_PUSHLOCALNEAR, 2,	/* SELF */
#2	HB_P_MESSAGE, 1, 0,	/* TPARENT */
#3	HB_P_SENDSHORT, 0,
#4	HB_P_MESSAGE, 4, 0,	/* CREATE */
#5	HB_P_PUSHLOCALNEAR, 2,	/* SELF */
#6	HB_P_MESSAGE, 15, 0,	/* X */
#7	HB_P_SENDSHORT, 0,
#8	HB_P_SENDSHORT, 1,
#9	HB_P_POP,

Ok first in line #1 Self (TChild) is pushed on the stack. It is then
receiving the TParent (Super) Message on line #2. #Line 3 Execute the
Self:TParent() message and leaves the result on the stack (this is what you
call the super-casted object). Line #4 Sends the Create() message to that
modified self, and lines #5-7 push the parameter ::X which is actually
becomes Self:X, there for we need to push Self (#5) then push the X message
(#6), then execute the message with no parameters (#7), which leaves the
result of ::X on the stack. This now becomes the parameter for the Create
Message (#4) which is now executed with 1 parameter in line #8. Since the
result is not being assigned it is not used, and being poped.

So, here is my idea. Instead of modifying the TChild object which is pointed
to by Self local variable. The TParent() method of TChild (#4) should return
a *NEW* item which is *copy* of the TChild self with only the ->ui modified
to point to the handle of TParent(). IOW it needs to be a *new* object which
is a clone of the object pointed to by Self local variable. This means that
when line #5 pushes local variable Self (for ::X) it will still be a good
self (TChild).

I already had a try with this in mind but there this was the method 
create who worked on the bad self (the copy, not the real one). I 
will retry having a better view of what does the VM.

Don't you want/need the Create() message to be executed on the copy?

Good luck (I'm confident it should work).

No, it must work on the original Object, the ui swaping just serve to 
find the SuperClass Method but then, this method must apply to 
the real Self object.

Yes, me too, your info was really appreciated and just give me 
another idea...

Dear Friends

I´ve doing some changes to hbmake to use the new harbour -go switch.
The tests works very fine, with an maketime reduced about 40%.

Let me know your comments.

Also , has anyone tested harbour -go with other C compiler.
I´ve  tested with the follow C compiler and work fine
Borland C++ 5.5.1
Deloire DJGPP(gcc version 2.95.3)

I am sorry and want to appologize. I missed the obvious point that You were
using xterm to make Your tests while I was using a text console.
After testing it under xterm I can confirm a problem You described in a post
and I suspect it is caused by a gtsln rather than hbmake. I have not had a
time look at it so far but I will try to find some and will post the results.

BTW, thanks for testing gtsln.

Allow me to apologise right back at you, I should have reiterated that I was
using rxvt to conduct my hbmake test when I ran into the "no cursor and odd
ending" problem.

Please forgive my ignorance, but wouldn't a new object that is a clone of
the original, with just the method pointers *replaced* with those of the
super be sufficient?

No, because, if it's really a clone, (not a simple Itemcopy), we will 
also have new array entries, so new DATA pointers. Then when a 
method will change some DATA value, it will only change the copy, 
not the self:Dataxxx. Also, if we use a simple ItemCopy, as any 
array, we will share the values with the original Object, so also 
changing ui and uiPrevcls from Self :-(((

My Idea, is to create a full new array, with one value, a copy of Self 
but I will set the ui and uiPrevCls value of this array. When reaching 
Vmdo or VmSend I then could get the correct SuperMethod and 
take back the Self value... This is what I currently trying ;-)

Thanks so much for the info, and your patience with me. Just one more
clarification:

If the new clone was not an itemCopy() and not arrayClone() but rather
custom code in between. I mean create a new array and fill it with the
*pointer* for each of the original data *items*, and copy pointers of super
for the methods. Now we have an object which is a "shadow" of the child
self, with the super methods. If a method changes a value of any data, it
will automatically be reflected in the "true" (child) self, because the data
items are actually *shared* between these two objects.

Again thanks for your patience,

Ron

Your idea is similar to mine and would certainly work also, but 
would take more time to create the shadow Object than create a 
one element array and simulating an object by assigning its ui 
value with the super class ui value while copying the current self as 
the only element of this new object/array. Later on, when reaching 
VmDo or VmSend I just do  ;

/* uiPrevCls has a value ... take care this is a dumy object */
hb_itemCopy( hb_stackSelfItem() , hb_arrayGetItemPtr( pSelf , 1 )
pSelf = hb_stackSelfItem(); // Now I'm working on the real Self 
object ;-))))

It is not actually implemented from hbclass.ch,

I don't think harbour's class syntax currently supports that method of
calling the method of the super class (yes, I use that all over my code
too).

> What can i do as a workaround ?

Use the "normal" method of calling the method of the super class:

,----
| ::super:init( ... )
`----

If it's vital that the super call is done prior to your LOCAL declarations
you could always do:

,----
| Method init( ... )
| Local xDummy := ::super:init( ... )
| Local n      := ::reliesOnSuperMethodBeenCalledFirst()
| Local c      := ::thisToo()
|    ...
`----

Not very elegant but it should work.

Wouldn't be enough to change its class and superclass
handles and return the object data as it is ?

That way we speed up the whole process.

Thinking in the real world, as Harbour is multi-platform, we MUST to learn
to think in multi-platform way, so, some new values must be included in
Harbour in order to deal with this multi-platform statements, as until now
is happening in some areas

So, I support the message of:

This is what we actually do but then there is a serious problem with 
the following ;

Method Create()
 Super:Create(::nX)
Return Self
 
Where ::nX is applied on an object where the class and superclass 
handle are changed, waiting for the message Create() to be 
applied... 

> That way we speed up the whole process.

I just create an array of one element with a simple copy (not clone) 
of self. I don't think the process could be slow. Also, this is only 
when calling Super ... 

At the VmDo and VmSend stage, I use hb_arrayGetItemPtr() and 
push it on the stack in place of the current self. Should not be slow.

Is this syntax specific to FWOO or does it belong to some other

::nX call must be solved before addressing

It is specific to FWOO, but in fact is just a
simple syntax extension: ( <ext: EXTERN, CFUNC, etc...> )

It will not break anything.

Yes, and it is. But you must know that in fact

Super:Create(::nX) is really
oSuper:=::Super() followed by oSuper:Create(::nX)

So ::Super() is evaluated, causing the Self object Class handles to 
be swapped (ui became uiSuper and uiPrevCls became ui to keep 
track of the original class handle) and Self is now an hybrid object 
(I call it oSuper here, where the ui class handle is pointing to the 
superclass handle)

Now we can evaluate oSuper:Create(::nX) and as expected, we first 
evaluate the param Self:nX ... Where Self de nX is our hybrid object 
(oSuper) waiting the message Create to be applied...


> Am I wrong ? :-)

No :-)

PS: I does some speed test program with and without my modif, if 
there is any speed modification it must classified as minor to nul.

That is why I told Charles to go ahead. It is

  Can we move message handling for later? I mean currently we have the 
following pcodes:

PUSHSELF
MESSAGE
<other pcodes>
SEND

  At this moment we are swapping class handle during MESSAGE handling. 
Why not move this swapping to SEND handling, if possible?

       hb_arrayAdd( pItem, hb_itemPutNL( NULL, puLocks[ uiCount ] ) );
  
  Back in dbrLockList, pItem is returned as pList, and it finishes
  with this line:
  
     hb_itemRelease( hb_itemReturn( pList ) );

  Unfortunately, the items in the array are not released, creating our
  memory warning at program end.
  (If I comment out the hb_arrayAdd( pItem ...  , then no blocks are
  left unreleased.)

  If the array is being returned, why does it need to be released?
  What is the best way to handle the memory leak?

   hb_itemPutNL() creates a new item. Only its value is copied into the 
array then you have to release this item. 
  Also if you know the number of elements then it is better to resize the 
array and next fill these elements - it will save many reallocations.

  Thanks.  After using hb_arraySize, do I use hb_arraySet ? That
  requires creation of an item.
  Is there a function that sets an array element's value from a
  fundamental type?

 I think I got it. This seems to be the most efficient for populating
 an array, and the memory leak is fixed. Let me know if this is not
 a recommended tactic:
 
   hb_arraySize( pItem, uiIndex );
   for(uiCount=0; uiCount < uiIndex; uiCount++)
      hb_itemPutNL( hb_arrayGetItemPtr( pItem, (ULONG) uiIndex ),
                    puLocks[ uiCount ] );

That'd mean that people wouldn't be able to use release builds to profile
their applications. Although, I must admit, the thought of speed overhead
had crossed my mind.

Random thought: In some compilers enabling profiling is a compiler switch,
much like enabling debugging is in Clipper/harbour.

  Actually, if a developer wanted to distribute a profile-able build

Since I implemented the __SetProfiler( On | Off ) function
(off by default), the profiler is completelly disabled and
it does not consumes any time at all, as it does nothing! :-)

This way, we don't need two sets of libraries for profiling.

Surely if there's a runtime On/Off state for the profiler, then it 
consumes at least a single "if" statement to check each time if it's on?

But such a developer (we're talking about someone using harbour, right?)
would have to rebuild harbour first if the switch in question were a
#define. Having to rebuild the VM each time you want to profile or not
profile seems a little inconvenient

Or am I missing something?

I think the concern is that checking the state of the profiler status flag
within the code of the HBM has a overhead. I know I've pondered it.

Do you think that "if" may impact the overall hvm speed ?

 I don't think that converting SAY & GET only is enough. For creating
 GUI application you will need additionally, at least, such widgets as menu and
 buttons. And the main thing is that GUI application is event driven,
 so the structure of the program, which provides user interface, is
 changed.
 The GUI lib shouldn't be GT lib for GUI, this will be other lib, with
 other functions set. But after writing it SAY, GET and other commands
 may be modified for using with this new lib.
 About year ago someone ( as far as I remember, Kwon Oh-Chul ) had
 posted here a short sample of creating a GUI window and some painting
 with Harbour. I send it to your private address.

I dunno. How often does it occur? Once every function call? I guess it all 
adds up.

I guess this springs from people using "reply" to send a new message to the
list? I notice that a number of people do this, you, Patrick and Antonio are
three examples.

One thing that you might all want to keep in mind when you use "reply" to
start a new thread of discussion or to fire off a one-off email is that, for
those of us with threaded email clients, you're simply adding to an existing
thread but changing the subject.

Is there a reason you guys report to a "random" email to send off a new
email instead of actually sending a new email?

We need a harbour profiler to profile the harbour profiler? That doesn't
quite make sense. Surely the correct method of profiling the HVM is to use
the profiler of your C development suite of choice? People have profiled
harbour's VM and RTL using these before.

If there are sections of the profiler that use PRG
code, why the profiler could not report usefull info
about that ?

Anyhow, I was not meaning that.

It seems quite funny to me that just a low level "if"
is so important now...

But no part of the profiler uses PRG code does it? The profile reporting
code is written in Clipper but reporting is different from gathering and the
question appeared to be about the gathering side of things.

I suppose some amusement can be derived from this if you view it as
"important". But I think Brian's original question, amusement or degrees of
"importance" aside, has some merit. I'd have thought that the question would
have occurred to you when you were designing the profiler gathering code:
that interesting question about how adding code to profile an application
adds overhead to the application.

. o O ( HVM == Heisenberg Virtual Machine? <g> )

IOW, I don't think there's unnecessary importance here but it would appear
that the curiosity we're seeing here makes sense. Obviously, Brian's
question (or, more to the point here, Mab's question) would make more sense
if he could provide some stats to show that it has a significant impact.

The class HB_Profile is written using PRG code.

BTW, why have you removed my original copyright from
profiler.prg ? 

The original profiler.prg source code showed how
to use the profiling functions, and it is clear that
your learned from it how to manage those functions.

The amusement comes from the fact that there is a lot
of Harbour code (hvm and rtl) that have very much impact
on Harbour execution speed, so why the profiler becomes
now so important on that aspect ?

Sure, but that's not the profiler, that's the profile reporter.

> BTW, why have you removed my original copyright from profiler.prg ?

I haven't. The file that is now profiler.prg is a brand new implementation,
written by me. I asked you and Patrick if the code was fine and, after a few
days with no feedback, neither of you objected. I'll happily remove my
original work from CVS if you'd prefer.

Or, if you prefer, I can move the code that calls the profile information
functions into a separate file and hand the copyright of that file over to
you. That seems fair as I guess you wouldn't want to claim copyright over an
original work that you didn't write.

> The original profiler.prg source code showed how to use the profiling

Sure, I took some clues as you took clues on HVM design from Clipper. I'm
sure you've read other source and other assembler to learn other things too,
you've said this much before. Are Nantucket and/or CA cited as copyright
holders of the HVM?

So, what would you like me to do? Hand my copyrighted work over to you
because I sussed the use of a couple of functions from reading your code?
What non-encumbered documentation should I have used to learn how to use the
profile information functions so that I could have written an original work
without violating your copyright?

Moreover, have you written any non-encumbered documentation for all the
other API functions you've written? I don't think it's good for harbour if
people have to hand copyright of their work over to those people who've
written API functions because examples of use of said API functions were the
only documentation available.

I don't think it's "important", but I think the curiosity makes sense given
the nature of the code we're talking about (it's profiling code).

Dave,

I am not asking for that.

I just ask you to respect my copyright (you can include yours there, too)
as I have been the first developer of a Harbour profiler.

It took me time and effort to implement a profiler,
and I did all the original work. Now you come with some OOP layers,
and remove my copyright. I don't see that quite fair.

The Harbour HVM is an original work, whose first (incompleted but) working
version
was implemented by me and opened the doors to some other developers to
contribute
to it. That is why it has my copyright, though some others have
done great contributions to it.

I showed how to build a virtual machine for Harbour, and that is why
I deserve its copyright.

I have shown how to build a Harbour profiler, and that is why I
deserve its copyright.

I am not claiming the copyright of your classes. I am just asking
that you are welcome to include your copyright there too, but I can't
find a reason why you removed my copyright from profiler.prg.

Profiler.prg was not an example. It was a working profiler reporting
code. I could have easily implemented the classes you have written
(and without the amount of complexity you have added to them), but I
welcomed you to include your code. And now you go and remove my copyright!

If you claim such a good understanding over the Harbour profiler,
then it would seems clear that you wouldn't need any docs to improve
it (both its performance and features).

Being the first developer of "a" thing is not the same as being the first
developer of "the" thing. But, whatever, I can see we're going to get into
yet another debate about how you interpret copyright. Instead of putting
everyone thru the pain of that I've simply restored your profile reporting
code.

No, the heart of the profiler still existed in the HVM. What I did was
totally reimplement the profile reporting side of things so that there was a
modular, extensible object oriented design. I was going to write an addition
to the debugger too that made use of this and allowed profiling from the
debugger. Given that this might also cause copyright problems too I'll pass
on that until there's non-encumbered documentation for the debugger API
available.

I did far more than "come with some OOP layers". Much more. I wish you'd
documented your deprecation of my work before I went to the trouble of
CVSing it.

You yourself said that you looked at Clipper's VM to get clues and ideas.
Please speak in terms of that, not in terms of who wrote what. I, for
example, how shown how to write a modular profile reporting system that
could be extended in lots of ways depending on user requirement.

I didn't remove your copyright from your profiler.prg. Please don't lie. I
offered my version of profile reporting code, complete with my copyright.
The only similarity with yours was a couple of calls to a harbour API. You
didn't object when I asked if we could use it as a replacement. Now you are
objecting some time after.

I know, but I thought that the profile reporting code could be done a lot
better. The only similarity between my code and your code was a couple of
API calls and I had to look at how you called them because no documentation
was available (and please don't count the loops, looping is a common idiom
that you can't seriously claim copyright over).

Your logic is flawed and, more to the point, very dangerous. This has
serious implications for people's use of non-documented API's in harbour as
it seems that using such an API could result in claims of copyright
infringement.

It's a good job this danger has been raised now and not later.

Dave,

The heart of the profiler is not just placed into the hvm.
Classes.c and dynsym.c are also involved, and more modules may 
get involved in the future too.

> so that there was a modular, extensible object oriented design. 

Object oriented programming is a "state of the art" coding
style that requires many years of practise. Complex OO code
is a clear sign of beginners.

> You yourself said that you looked at Clipper's VM to get clues and ideas.

Could you point a msg where I said that ? 

I used Valkirie demo to understand the pcode structure of Clipper.  
I haven't developed Valkirie myself. Valkirie was a commercial product
available to the whole Clipper users community. 

Did someone, before me, explained how to build a virtual machine 
for Harbour ?

You are welcome to CVS your code, but don't use my copyrighted
profiler.prg source code, to include yours and remove my copyright, please.

> You didn't object when I asked if we could use it as a replacement.

Today I just realized you removed my copyright. Something
unbelievable after so many talking here about copyrights rights.
Is that your way of respecting some other developers work ?

Given that keyboard input checking has a much greater overhead, I doubt
very much that the impact of the profiler status has a measurable impact.

There's just one tiny little problem with your argument, Antonio. Dave
did *not* modify your profiler.prg to come up with his profiler.prg.
Dave wrote a brand new profiler.prg *from scratch* and then replaced
your profiler.prg with his. He did not hack your code and he did not
remove your copyright. Please note that this is not the first time that
a module has been replaced with a brand-new module with the same name
(it's often a case of replacing a prg module with a c module, but not
always).

Sorry, I oversimplified my explanation, yes, other parts are included in the
profiler too. Note that I haven't removed copyright on any of those items of
code. I've not removed copyright on the profiler, all I've done is write a
totally new reporting system.

As someone with many years of practise, I'd agree (well, apart from the
"state of the art" bit as OO is quite old now).

As someone with many years of practise, I'd agree to some degree.

Anyway, your point is? Did the profile reporting hierarchy strike you as
complex? Why? Are you suggesting that I'm a beginner with OO? Something
else? Peer review is welcome, this is the reason that I posted the code long
before I even asked if I should replace your code with it. You've had plenty
of time to give a technical review of your impression.

Moreover, if you can't follow the design I'll happily explain it and the
motivation behind it for you. The documentation was coming in the next week
or so (they would have come sooner if it hadn't been for a couple of very
unfortunate events in my personal life, but that's a different matter that
has nothing to do with harbour).

Off hand, no, because it was a couple of mailing lists ago. Hmm, it could
have been a private email. Either way, I don't have the exact quote to hand.
If I find it I'll provide you with it.

I have no idea what you're suggesting here. I didn't use anything to remove
any copyright. I asked you if it was ok to replace the monolithic reporting
function with a granular OO profile reporter that could be the basis of a
number of different reporting systems (including a profiling module for the
debugger) and you said that was ok. My file was available for review for
many days before I made the switch.

I didn't remove any copyright, we switched from something that was your
copyright to something that was my copyright. Just like we've switched back
again.

I did not remove your copyright. Please stop trying to spread that lie.
Which part of PROFILER.PRG, that I placed into CVS, contained your work?

Is telling lies yours? Surely the fact that I've reinstated your work even
though you're totally mistaken about what I've done should tell you
otherwise?

So, is this correct then? If anyone wants to make use of an API that you've
written but not yet documented (__DYNSGETPRF() and __GETMSGPRF() for
example) and they look to code that already uses it to see how you're
supposed to call it their code then falls under your copyright?

Moreover, you'll start to claim in public that they are a thief who doesn't
respect copyright law?

Would you be so kind as to document exactly how viral you think your
copyright is? What currently undocumented parts of the VM and RTL are the
rest of us allowed to call without the danger of being branded as copyright
infringer who doesn't respect other developer's copyrights?

For example, what you've claimed today suggests that if anyone were to write
a new module for the debugger, or even totally replace an add-on for it with
new code, you'd claim copyright over their code because they're calling
functions you wrote for the debugger. This is an interpretation of copyright
that I've not previously been aware of.

Lets analize it the other way round.

Could Dave write his code without the original profiler.prg
code ? I seriously doubt it.

He argues that there is not a provided profiler low level
functions docs, so he used my code as a doc. But that is 
not true, as the original profiler.prg provided much more
that a sample of those functions (btw, my changelogs entries
explained those new low level functions syntax). 

Profiler.prg was showing how to manage the dynamic symbol table, 
how to step through it, and how to use the classes functions to 
get all their profiler info.

As far as I see it, the original profiler.prg source code
is the base (or the seed) for his work. Again, I may say, I am 
not claiming a copyright for his work. I just asked him to respect 
mine.

But none of your code is in his work. He did not start with your code
as a base and then modify it to come up with his version of
profiler.prg. He started from scratch. That makes his work an original
work, not a derived work.

Your erased all my work, my copyright and then you used the filename

enhanced it, meanwhile -curiously- Patrick was able to extend
it without no great problems).

I don't agree with you. And more over, we are
talking here about _working_ code, not concepts
and ideas. The previous profiler.prg source code
was doing its job, and it was showing the basis
for a Harbour profiler.

Would Dave have been able to write his classes
without having reviewed the original profiler.prg
source code previously ?

Given actual documentation for the profiler API, of course I could have.
Your doubts and lies about my time, abilities and motivations are
immaterial.

Moreover, even though you are badly mistaken about all three of those items
I've still placed your copyrighted code back in harbour's CVS. What more do
you want Antonio Linares? What does it take to stop you spreading lies on
the harbour mailing lists?

Feel free to bury your head in the sand all you want, but that's how
copyright works. It covers what you create. It does not cover concepts

Subject: [Harbour] The profiler reporting code, a clarification
Message-ID: <20010726184109.K30092@hagbard.davep.org>

Just to set the record straight. My offering of a totally different and
original method of profile reporting was not, despite what Antonio keeps
saying, an attempt to remove his or Patrick's copyright from anything. I
didn't remove any copyright, neither is my code a modification of his.

It was a simple and honest attempt to use some of my spare time to try and
enhance harbour (a project I care about, my previous defence of the project
during the last few months should demonstrate to honest people that this is
the case), partly to provide a set of base classes that would allow people
to write their own profile reports and partly to allow me to enhance the
debugger by adding a profiler (inspired by the profiler that people will
know and love from MrDebug).

I know that the majority of the people on this list don't actually need this
clarification but I feel compelled to point out that the motivations that
Antonio is inventing for me have nothing to do with the actual motivations I
had.

Apologies for having to make another defence against Antonio's attacks.

And here comes the argument ad-hominem and the insults while, at the same
time, totally ignoring that it takes more than one person to form a thread
of discussion.

More to the point, I've asked some important questions that you've totally
ignored. Don't you like a "style" that attempts to ensure that we don't have
licence and copyright problems in harbour?

No, monolithic refers to everything in one function. I don't actually recall
saying anything had "simplicity".

Correct, I did all of this with your express permission.

Yes, but in a monolithic way. What I did was provide a method of allowing
anyone to extend the reporter without ever needing to change the code in the
RTL. But I'm sure I don't need to point out to you how subclassing works.

Again, imagine what I was going to do with the profile reporter I had
planned for the debugger.

Harbour's ChangeLog isn't there to document the API. But, thank-you for
pointing me what documentation there is. Much appreciated.

Yes, I would have. If PROFILER.PRG hadn't have existed I'd have asked you,
via the list, what functions in the API would give me what information.

My apologies, that was a typo, that should indeed read "Restored".

Is fixing spelling errors in the ChangeLog seen as an ok thing to do? If so

The fact that CA-Clipper and Harbour both exist without legal problems
demonstrates this principle.

Copyright doesn't cover the act of creation either. Copyright only
covers the end result of creating something. If you want to protect your
concepts or ideas, then you must either attempt to patent them or
attempt to keep them secret.

If this if( bProfiler ) is tested for *every* Function Call, Method Call,
Object Data Assignment, etc. This will definitely accumulate to have an
impact. Especially for event driven GUI code like FWH, where every event may
involve numerous such activity within the given class hierarchy.

There are at least 2 other ways to implement the profiler gathering
information, that will *not* have any such negative impact, and are
consistent with how profiling is done in well established compilers.

1.
   a. Change hvm.c to call hb_vmDo(), and hb_vmSend() by means of a function
pointer.
   b. Set the function pointers to hb_vmDo() and hb_vmSend() respectively be
default.
   c. Add compiler switch to Harbour that generates an HB_P_PROFON which
will force assignment of these function pointers  to profiling versions of
the above. It will also generate an HB_P_PROFOFF at the end of such module
which will reset the function pointers (this also offer the extra benefit of
allowing profiling of a specific module only).

Or:

2.
   a. Add compiler switch to Harbour that generates an HB_P_FUNPROF,
HB_FUNPROFEND etc., which will wrap every function call, method execution,
etc., within the module using the switch. The HVM code for HB_P_FUNPROF will
start the clock for the symbol, and HB_FUNPROFEND will end the clock and
record the info.

Either approach will have no speed impact, what's so ever, on modules not
compiled with the profiling switch. Will work faster for the profiling
(because the if( bProfiler ) will not be necessary, and will allow a module
level profiling.

I am just claiming that Dave has no rights to remove
my copyright (and Patrick's copyright) from Profiler.prg.

If he wants to implement whatever profiler related classes,
then he may add new files to the CVS and place there his code
and his copyright.

Dave has asked you *explicitly* for permission to *replace* your code, with
his new code and you explicitly agreed:

Why did you *not* say, at *that* time, that you rather he *adds* his code
*without* *removing* *yours*?

I think a better question is, why you *now* thinks differently? I can only
speculate as to the reasons you appear to have multiple personalities for
quiet some time now.

If you still have the silly argument that his code is somehow based on
concepts you invented, please explain which specific function/method/portion
of his code, you claim is yours, or based on yours?

If you are content (as you now claim to be) with Dave claiming copyright to
his work, as long as *your* file still exists, than why can't he claim the
same copyright if your file does not exist?

Because I have no interest in adding redundant code to harbour. That's a
pointless exercise. Moreover, it's not that important to me that my code is
part of harbour.

We have a solution right now, Antonio's copyrighted offering has been
restored so all is well.

I did not remove your copyright from anything. I replaced your profile

I guess this is mostly aimed at Patrick. Patrick, given that time is

Unless you can claim that Davids' work is a derivative work, then

  So my point is that, yes, it would seem that even a tiny if *could*

  in every loop.  Does anyone know for sure?  Is it worth measuring?
  Probably.
  
  So Dave: if implemented, my idea would allow the developer to decide
  whether the (tiny bit of) overhead of the profiler should be linked
  in, and still have the run-time setting to turn profilinmg on/off.
  If you decide the overhead is meaningless, always build with it.
  If we are sure that the overhead is meaningless, then my idea is,

  I really hate it when I hear two sides arguing, and neither side
  seems willing to use a sympathetic ear to understand what the other
  is saying.

  Antonio placed work in the cvs.  He agreed to have the new code
  replace the old, but he clearly did not *expect* all trace of his
  efforts and contribution to disappear. We all take pride in our
  work, and clearly he was surprised that the
  "copyright/marker/symbol" of his work was removed. (Let's not
  redefine "remove" -- his work and its symbolic mark was removed.)

  Now before you all start attacking me for waxing poetic and
  teary-eyed while mistaking a legal statement for a symbol, turn on
  the sympathetic ear for one second and realize this is a
  *legitimate* human reaction to a misunderstanding.
  And be smart enough to realize that legal arguments do not counter
  such a situation.

  On the other hand, Dave clearly had only the best of intentions and
  tried diligently to get full approval for his action. Though there
  was a misunderstanding of what was agreed to, he does not deserve
  to be insulted either, and should be commended for his efforts.

  But, oops, there was a misunderstanding.
  So come to terms about the best resolution. Dave, I like your code
  and don't want it removed.  Probably Antonio and everyone else
  agrees.  So let's resolve the specific problem AND  the general
  policy issue it raises.

  First the general question. Is it right for all trace of a person's
  copyright/credit to disappear when a better replacement can be had?
  The legal definition of derived might dictate "sure", but I think any
  normal person would feel a sense that something's not right about
  it.  If the replacement would never have existed without the
  original code, then the original code deserves some respect, In My
  Poetic Opinion.
  So we create a clash between the legal purpose of a copyright notice
  and the cultural value of citing our sources.
  Personally, I think if a prg source is replaced by a better C
  source, it would be nice to have "based on work by So-and-So"
  even if it has no legal merit.  If "based on" is too much, then
  "inspired by" might be appropriate.
  Would these create any legal problems?
  Does anyone else care that contributions that lead to better
  contributions should get honorable mention instead of disappearing?

  Now for specific: Antonio, Dave's code is different enough that he
  deserves copyright for it.  If your code doesn't exist too, then
  there's nothing for your copyright to cover.
  1) would the kind of "credit citation" I mentioned be of any value
  for you, even though there's no legal ownership involved for you?
  2) Do you want to keep your code in cvs in a separate file so it can
  have your original copyright and serve as an optional interface?
  3) Shall we leave the original code in the CVS but commented-out in
  order to keep an historical record of the copyright?

  I suggest 1.
  But realize that if we all agree the ONLY text we put in our headers
  is LEGAL mumbo-jumbo, then you will be out of luck.

  As will we all.

It is just a matter of acknowleging some others previous
work and effort on an specific Harbour area. You may say: 
"This code is not based on the previous profiler code developed by
Antonio and Patrick". That is enough!

Imagine tomorrow someone comes from a new hvm with a total
new design. Now he may erase all hard work done on previous
hvm and nobody will know that a group of developers worked
hard to create the first hvm. I don't think that is fair.

How such a simple concept is so difficult to be understood by some
of you ?

I now understand I can not claim for a copyright, as it is
not a derivative work. ok. But Patrick and I deserve some
credits as the original developers of the first Harbour profiler.

I think it is easier to say "Notice that the first Harbour profiler
code was developed by ... and ..., with further contributions of ...,
..., ..., though it has been completely replaced
by an OOP approach copyrighted by Dave". (not based on, and not inspired
by).

How would that happen? The only non-overhead methods I can think of are the
ones that Ron's suggested.

(IANAL) The above really has nothing legal to say, what that speaks about is
recognition of another person's work outside of the legal arena. Please note
I've not been attacked because I failed to note who wrote a previous
implementation of a profile reporter, I'm being attacked for supposedly
replacing someone's copyright with my own. The former is, at the very worst,
an easily correctable slip in etiquette, the latter is a very serious claim
that shouldn't be made lightly and can't be taken lightly.

>   3) Shall we leave the original code in the CVS but commented-out in

Note that CVS is just such an historical record. That's where I pulled
Antonio's implementation of a profile reporter from so that I could restore
his code to keep him happy.

This is something totally different now. Are you saying that you'd like an
acknowledgement in my code? You've been spreading this nasty rumour that I'd
removed your copyright from a body of code but now you you're saying that
you'd simply like an acknowledgement in my code.

Which is it Antonio, what do you actually want? What will actually make you
happy, allow me to contribute to harbour (even though I had your express
permission to do what I did anyway) and stop you from spreading nasty and
untrue rumours about me?

It's a very simple concept that I think, despite this new insult of yours,
most people, myself included do understand. You'll notice that we obviously
do understand it because when you started to talk about removal of copyright
we reacted to your accusation of removal of copyright, not to lack of
thanks, acknowledgement or some form of credit for previous work done.

If you're simply saying that you'd like to see something along the lines of:

"This code is a ground-up implementation of a harbour profile reporter that,
 while it doesn't contain any of their code, is inspired by the previous
 work of Antonio Linares and Patrick Mast. Many thanks to them for their
 permission to move to this body of code."

in my code then why not simply say so? I think the above would be a nice
thing for me to do and would make sense.

So, please don't invent positions for everyone else and then ask us why it's
difficult for us to understand something we already know. Moreover, please
clarify your accusations of removal of copyright. I'd also like to see some
actual technical feedback regarding the comments of "complexity" and
"experience of OO design" that you've made.

Are we going to duplicate hb_vmDo() and hb_vmSend() into
the hvm (and all apps we create!!!), just to avoid a low level 
if( boolean ) ???

That is ridiculous!!! There is no speed loss at all on such if!!!!!
It is a pure CPU operation, extremelly fast!

There are hundreds of places into the hvm where that loss
may be recovered, without having to duplicate such amount of code.

And I agree, there's nothing wrong with that. So, are you now formally
retracting your accusations of copyright removal? Are you also giving,
again, express permission for us to use the OO model that I've written?

Can I again, with your express permission, replace profiler.prg with my
contribution (I'll obviously and happily put in a comment that says that
it's inspired by your previous work).

And a fact that I agree with, but that isn't what you were saying about me.
You were saying that I'd replaced your copyright with my copyright on your
body of code.

Bablefish gives "To foolish words, oidos deaf" so I guess the translation
hinges around the meaning of "oidos".

Is the suggestion that Ron's words were foolish? I thought it managed to
catch my concerns about what you're claiming I'm doing just right. Removal
of someone's copyright is a very serious accusation.

Dave,

Please stop saying I am insulting you. 
I don't have any wish or any motivation to insult you.
If you take some other person words as insults, 
that is your problem, not mine.

> This is something totally different now. 

For many of us, this is our first experience on
a cooperative open source development over the internet. 
We are all learning. We are not "perfect". We learn and
we make mistakes. (call it "humans").

I have not spread any rumours anywhere!
I have just expressed my point of view here (not rumours), 
though I could be wrong on some concepts.

That is also a new position on your side. Yesterday
it seemed you didn't care about it at all.

I will be glad to express my ideas about your
OO code once this situation gets cleared.

Antonio

Can you point me to somewhere where I said we were going to do it or that I
even suggested it was a good idea?

Please read what I actually wrote.

I don't doubt it. Perhaps you've forgetting the email I wrote yesterday
where I said the debate would do better to be substantiated with actual
figures that demonstrate a performance loss?

Why would you insult Ron's words like that? He asked some sensible questions
that could do well to be answered. I know I've asked them a couple of times
now and simply had them ignored while being told that I'm simply trying to
"get the last word" or something.

Reasoned debate is a lot more reasonable if you don't complain about people
taking part in it and don't insult people's contribution to it.

You've made some pretty serious claims in the past day, I think it's only
fair that you respond to the questions that these accusations raise instead
of attacking people who ask the questions.

I will be happy if you just say "there was a previous Harbour

He publically speculated about me:

"I think a better question is, why you *now* thinks differently? 
I can only speculate as to the reasons you appear to have multiple 
personalities for quiet some time now."

What rights does he has to analize some others human beings ?

He may better analize himself. I am sure he will
have a large way to go (his whole life).

In Hebrew you'd get:

If you have nothing good to say, say nothing.

What exactly was stupid, my technical suggestion, or my observation that you
must be drunk again?

1. Isn't this what linkers are for? Are you sure that suggestion #1 can't be
implemented such that if the application doesn't use one of the two
versions, it can simply be removed from linking?

3. Suggestion #2 does not involve 2 versions at all.

What is ridiculous is, that everyone's applications (in development or even
released) must include profiling code executing on every
function/method/object-data call.

All known such code must be optimized, especially what is of no value, in
most situations.

I haven't been following this debate very closely, but the concept 
expressed in the paragraph above seems totally bizarre to me. There are a 
whole bunch of functions that I originally wrote for Harbour (many of the 
string functions and math functions for example) which have since been 
replaced, but it doesn't bother me one way or another.

It's kind of like Microsoft acquiring a new technology from some company 
(as is their wont) and adding lines to the top of every source file to the 
effect of "this code replaces previous work by Joe Bloggs here at 
Microsoft which never saw light of day since the stuff we bought was so 
much better" . . .

Just my 2c (Australian cents, so with the current exchange rates it's 
worth nothing :-)

I'm not, so don't accuse me of this because it has nothing to do with my
actual motivations for writing what you quote. It's not the first time
you've hassled me with this line while I've been defending myself against an
attack from Antonio. Why?

Don't you understand the seriousness of the accusation he's made against me?
I want to be *totally* clear and *totally* sure about his accusation before
I contribute anything more to harbour.

While I'd agree that the above probably doesn't fall into the category of
"right speech" there where some useful technical/legal questions and
observations in his text. One's that I've also asked but had ignored in
favour of complaints that I'm "trying to get the last word".

Moreover, he only did to you what you've done to me. That doesn't make it
right, far from it, but it does mean that the kettle is calling the pot
black.

There are indeed many if() statements, etc., every where. Most can not be so
easily optimized out, because they are not related to such isolated issue.

Just ask yourself how does your C compiler handles profiling? Is it not by
using a command line switch, that generates some extra code, and by forcing
linkage of some extra stuff?

I wish we could have optimized many such if()s out (I added such myself
too), but most times you just can't without removing functionality. This
OTOH is a classic case of something that can be optimized.

This performance issue was not at all the only/main concern that brought
Brian to bring this up. I know because we discussed it by phone previously.
This issue was compounded by the fact, that ever since the addition of the
extra structure members and logic required by the profiler, he is
experiencing odd GPFs.

I suggested to him to try def it out, and at the same instant, said that it
wouldn't be a bad idea to have an option to def it out anyway.

You have the gift to put everything out of its proportion.
You analize every word in a mail and respond to every word. This can
lead to endless discussions. I know you are gonna go in discussion with
me now over this, and if I don't give up, we will still be discussing
this next week, the week after, etc...

We have all made our point, there is a agreement, so, case closed ok?

Yes you have, you keep repeating that I've removed your copyright from a
body of your work. This is totally untrue. I've replaced a body of your work
with a body of my work and did so with your express permission.

That's an out and out lie. I posted the code to the harbour list a couple of
weeks back and then kept updating people on what I was doing and soliciting
input and ideas (all the time making the code available from my web site so
that people could see what it looked like and how it worked). I also made a
point of explicitly soliciting the input of yourself and Patrick regarding
the idea of replacing the current profile reporting system with a totally
new one. Even when I received your express permission I still waited a few
days to allow for any other objections and any other input before I carried
out the act that you gave permission for.

Then, some time later, you pretend that I've removed copyright from your
work and now you claim that I wasn't interested in input regarding my code?
Exactly how much request for input does someone have to post before you
start to believe that they are interested in input?

And then you claim you don't try and spread unfounded rumour....

Good. I'll CVS a new version of the code some time soon (possibly today but,
if not, early next week).

Well, ok, if that makes you happy. Personally I think that's the wrong way
round. The CVS server and the ChangeLog show the history of this. But, if
you'd sooner have a credit of history rather than a credit of ideas that's
fine by me.

The same rights you have to speculate the beginner status (and other
offensive innuendos) of someone who developed code, where you know very well
he is far from being a beginner.

More than the rights you had to be "surprised" by the removal of your
profiler.prg after you explicitly authorized such removal.

Yes, and some of us take advantage of this right to analyze self, before
taking stupid actions, and saying things we shouldn't have.

Recently you have demonstrated multiple times, the ability to "come to
senses" and analyze self, only *after* taking serious negative actions, and
making extremely offensive remarks.

It doesn't take a genius to speculate about why would someone of your
intelligence level may take such silly course of actions. When it becomes so
obvious, "speculating", might not even be the right term.

Now if I said, 'sorry I didn't mean to insult you', will you feel better?

Or, maybe calling what I have to say, "stupidities", was a compliment?

Dave,

I give up...

You may keep talking (writting) and talking (writting) for years...
I am not interested in your game.

And I will not insult you, though I have a
strong desire to do it.

After having read a lot of fighting ( Yeah it may look like I am still asleep

discussions are leading no where.

I do have a technical comment about the if( boolean ) : This statement takes
almost no time whatsoever. At most a couple of T states with the current
technology, so you won't even notice the difference with or without one if.

Are you suggesting that there is something to be ashamed of taking place at
my home?

You are hereby granted unconditional, and irrevocable rights, to freely
share with anyone you want, anything you might have seen, heard, or
otherwise found out, while being my guest at my home, using any medium
available to you.

> Are we going to play that dirty game now ?

You had gotten plenty dirty, not too long a go. You somehow thought, I have
the same kind of short memory you now seem to have?

Telling someone who used to be a friend, that he appears to have gaps in
time, when it seems he loses control over his actions, is far from a game.

> Is that your wish ?

I wish I was there in Spain few weeks back, when you have suddenly decided
that I was some kind of evil thief, having some hidden agenda, only because
I released a free product of mine under GPL.

I wish I was there to look at your eyes, when you erased my files, and
removed admin rights from every one but yourself.

I wish I could talk to someone close to you, to learn if you are known to be
under the influence of some medicine, or anything else, that might explain
the serious laps of judgment, you seem to have in recent weeks.

I wish you could come clean, and admit, what ever problem you are having, so
you could start recovering. One can't fix any problem, until such problem is
being acknowledged.

I wish I could turn time back, and save you from what you did,

Ron

No. I talked to Brian after that fix.

Sorry but I stand behind every word I said. I'm sure you were under the
influence of something, that jeopardized your sense of judgment, at least
twice in the past few weeks.

I wish you knew, that I don't say it to inflame you, and I truly wish, all
of these would have never been done in public. But now we have no other
choice. I sincerely believe you have a serious problem, and I sincerely
believe it has to do with some kind of substance abuse.

If I had similar problem, I would have likely been just as defensive and
secretive about it. But I could only hope, that someone would care about me
enough, to be willing to confront me, and try to force me to admit that I
have a problem.

Not all man are evil, most of us are actually good natured, and very well
intended.

  I don't think it is the best solution since this is hardcoding some 
very exceptional handling inside the expression optimiser. This forces 
the __dblist() call for other rdd implementations - this means every LIST 
command will have to be preprocessed into __dblist function.
  I think that ,,macro stripping'' should be done by the preprocessor - 
cannot we add a new marker for it?

Give me a break Antonio. I have no "game", I'm simply trying to donate some
code to harbour. You always pull this "game" lark when faced with the facts
of your attacks. Please don't ask me to take responsibility for your actions
and please don't complain when I point you to your actions.

> And I will not insult you, though I have a strong desire to do it.

I don't, for a moment, doubt that you do. Why not simply get it over with,
in private if you like, and then accept responsibility for your actions and
redirect your attention to the technical and legal questions that you've
raised?

<sigh> I see, I'm not allowed my point of view because, if I put it over and
clarify it, I'm walking into a analysis trap that's been set for me. No, I
don't "analize every word" and, no matter how many times you repeat that, it
won't make it true. Please don't invent motives for me, publish them and ask
me to take responsibility for them.

Posting them one might well be a lack of comprehension or understanding.
Posting them after you've had the facts provided for you starts to look a
little dishonest.

Agreement? I don't agree with the things that Antonio has been saying about

posted about me.

Agreement? All I see in your contribution here is disagreement. Could it be
that you're not following your own advice?

Or maybe we may talk about how you illegally moved
to the United States, and how you have been
exploting your relatives (also illegal moved to USA)
at your software company.

Or we may also talk about our meeting at Hamburg,
about the phone call you did, and about the person
you took to your hotel room meanwhile your wife was
at USA with your kids...

You see, my sense of judgment is jeopardized...

Don't be ridiculous. I didn't know you could be such a child. Take it to
somewhere else. You're making me sick with this. Gosh! Take it somewhere
else, please!

I don't care about what Ron does with his personal life, he is a great

No, because CVS already tracks the history! Anybody can check out any
previous version that they want to. All they have to do is check the
ChangeLog and CVS log for the file in question and then tell CVS that
they want that version.

Antonio,

There is only one way to to solve this problem:

Take off completaly your profiler code from the Harbour CVS. I presume you
can do that, but it must be done ASAP.

And if you want a counsel from a friend, stop exchanging Emails with Dave
and Ron, it takes you no where and does not serve you at all (quite the
oposite). As you like proverbs, this is one for you:

No, I don't hate you. Not at all. As I told before, I love your work and I

Dave has no sense. You ended up winning what? One or two lines of credit in
a profiler.prg? Now Harbour is about proudness? C'mon, everybody knows and
even CVS knows that you did the original work. The profiler is you child and
it is explicitly shown in all the other sources.

Please, let's keep the level here. We used to be a bunch of friends creating
a compiler. What are we now?

Really the best regards,

How would that help anything? Why must it be done? The profile gathering
code is a useful addition to harbour and, no matter who wrote the harbour
reporter that's part of the harbour RTL the fact remains that there's a
profiling API, written by Antonio, that's useful to anyone and everyone.

I see no sense in removing it.

It was meant to be patently offensive, for a reason that you are not part

  Thanks, that's the kind of informed confirmation I was asking for.
  
  There's no reason to add extra code, alternative functions, or
  discussion if the amount of time is negligible.
  At this point, if a test were to show a slowdown it would be worth
  chasing, but without such a test it's not. When I can get back to
  testing the current cvs with my large app (a first test with Janica's
  change STILL gpf'ed, but I need to try some things to be sure), I
  will regression-test some actions that we've been "profiling" all
  along--just to be sure there's no slowdown.
  If there's more than a %200 increase in the times I'll re-raise the
  issue.  ;-)

 This is a very important point. Eventually the RDDADS should have
 LIST (and LOCATE, and others) mapped to different functions because
 the concept in __dbList cannot take advantage of a server.
 LOCATE is dependent upon receiving pre-processed codeblocks, whereas
 rddads needs the strings to pass to the server, AND these functions
 in general are dependent upon the app reading each record to evaluate
 FOR and WHILE, which should be redirected to the server if possible.

I have come to the US legally, under a Tourist Visa, some 16 years ago. I
was offered a job just few weeks later and made petition for Green Card
which was approved. I'm a proud US citizen, married to a US citizen and
father to 2 awesome US citizens. My only relatives in the US are 2 brothers,
both are legal residents.

You are welcome to talk about anything you care. I wish you could provide
the group with more details about me "exploiting relatives in my software
company".

I'm not sure which phone call you refer to, but it sounds so mysterious,
please proceed.

Yes, I did have a private encounter in Germany while being married. While
it's nothing to be proud of, I'm not ashamed of it either. My wife knew
perfectly well of my doubts regarding my ability to remain monogamous,
*before* we got married. Later, when I decided to commit to monogamous life
style, and learned to appreciate the wholesomeness of being a part of a true
couple, she was provided with the details of this experience in Germany. So
again, feel free to explore this very interesting subject. Regardless of
your intentions, my experience might be of service to others who have
similar ambiguities regarding this subject, and are invited to email me in
privates with their thoughts.

BTW, Miki is here next to me, sending her regards, with the hopes, you'll
get better soon.

> You see, my sense of judgment is jeopardized...

Yes, I know that, the question is do you really know how much?

An if( boolean ) statement on a good processor with the variable in a register at
the time of usage which is a pretty common is 4 T cycles if it fails ( 2 for the
condition, 2 for the jump passed the else ) and 3 T cycles if succeeds*

So if you have a Pentium at 500 MHz then the timeloss is at the worst case 8
nanoseconds per Do() call which means that you will never notice that it is there in
the first place.

* Most probable 80x86 assembly code :
     or/and reg,reg  ( 1 T cycle )
     je else_part  ( 1 T cycle if it fails, 2 T cycles if it succeeds )
.. true condition
     jmp end_part ( 2 T cycles )
else_part:
 .. false condition
end_part

I doubt very much whether you'd even notice a slowdown.


CU :)

__DBLIST() is a prg level function that simply uses QOUT() to display the
value of an evaluated codeblock at the prg level.

It has no reliance or interaction with any RDD in specific. It does the
exact equivalent of:

 ? SomeField, OtherField, YetAnother

The above should work the same regardless of which RDD is being used.
Because it simply send as parameters the value of the fields, which all RDD
must be able to support.

When ever you map the LIST command to other function[s], you will not have
the limitation I had, of having to remain compatible to the documented
interface of __DBLIST(), it will then be easy to pass the field list as a
string, instead of array of codeblocks which __DBLIST() must accept and
support.

I'll gladly help you support a different implementation of LIST for ADS when
ever you are ready (should be very easy). I searched and experimented for
days, with trying to resolve this with the pre-processor, but found no way
to remain 100% Clipper compatible, other then optimizing __DBLIST() in
expression optimizer.

Hi me again,

Test is a function that multiply by 2 the first
element in aArray and store the result in the
first element of aArray.

In CA-Clipper you can do:

    Test( aArray )

or

    Test ( @aArray )   

in both cases the result are the same. But in
Harbour, the second one produce and error because

      if( HB_IS_ARRAY( pItem ) )

is false, and

      else if( HB_IS_BYREF( pItem ) || iParam == -1 )
         hb_itemPutNI( hb_itemUnRef( pItem ), iValue );

put a number over the array passed by reference.

This behavior is correct? We need to change all concurrencies of
@aArray for aArray?

Thanks

Ricardo

Ron:

 LIST has the same FOR and WHILE clauses as many other commands. These
 *may* need to be handled on a server. If it works the same as LOCATE,
 the pp creates codeblocks that are passed to the function (was it
 __dbLocate?)  This means the RDD layer cannot pass the strings to the
 server and process the filtering there. All records are read into the
 client and eval'd with the bFor and bWhile blocks.
 It was my intention to add to ads.ch a new LOCATE command to direct
 it to another function that can decide if the expressions can be
 handled by the server or if __dbList is needed for local evaluation.
 If your changes now require LIST to be mapped to __dbList, then we
 would have to expand its parameter list and deal with compatibility
 issues.
 Ryszard's point that commands should not be forcibly bound
 to a particular function sounds like a correct fundamental point to
 me.

It looks like a bug in hb_storni, which needs to allow for arrays being
passed by reference. (And the other hb_stor... functions probably have
the same bug.)

Subject: [Harbour] procline errors
Message-ID: <17524133892.20010727155211@abacuslaw.com>

 I have seen several times an error msg or trace that reports a wrong
 line number. It seems to center around an IF structure, but I have
 not been able to isolate it in a small test.

 In the current episode, I have a tracelog function being called just
 after an ENDIF:

         IF
           DO WHILE
            ...
           ENDDO  // 577
         ELSE
            IF
            ...
            ENDIF
         ENDIF
         tracelog(, "596", ordscope(0), ordscope(1), 1->last)

 The tracelog call is on line 596, but in the tracelog function
 Procline(1) reports line 577, which is the last line before the prior
 ELSE.

 If I put TWO lines of code above the tracelog, it gets corrected. But
 even after 1 other line it still reports 577.

Apparently my simple, constrained, and courteous reply, choosing to ignore
your direct insult attempt, did not satisfy you.

You just couldn't resist being patently repetitive. You didn't make the
slightest effort to appear non-biased, and most importantly, non offensive.
This strikes me as extremely hypocrite, coming from someone appearing to be
concerned with offensive expressions toward a 3rd party.

If you had hoped to project even the slightest hint of sincerity, you would
have sent it privately, so as to serve as an example. But obviously you are
just as good a suspect, of doing the very thing you pretended to preach me
for.

Since this must mean you were hoping for more "action" in order to get your
satisfaction, then here it is:

Please don't attempt to rate any aspect of my qualifications, as you simply
lack the implied superiority, inherent in such attempt. You are far from
being on my incredibly "bright", "respectable", or even plain "friendly"
groups of colleges, worse, you have earned high marks on my "least
courteous" colleges list.

So that it will be perfectly clear to those interested, that the above is
*not* my way of getting back at you, but rather something you worked quiet
hard at earning, over a long duration. Here are copies of our last private
interchange, from couple months ago:

David, I think the question might not have been clear enough, and after
re-reading the License Text you referred to, as well as my question, and
your reply, I'm left with serious questions and concerns.

Would it be possible to discuss this over the phone? I find it extremely
difficult to properly raise and discuss these issues by email.

If at all possible, please forward a phone number, and good time to call, or
please call me on any of these:

Cell  : (805) xxx-xxxx
Home  : (805) xxx-xxxx
Office: (805) xxx-xxxx

TIA

Ron

And here is your glaring reply (there was no additional text, in the reply)!

No.

So let's just say, I don't consider you a model for anything remotely

But it need to be done in a organized way. Not that x and y makes

I'm not up for new development's of the web site but I wouldn't mind
updating the upload page and the 3rd party page.

I take it I don't need any Windows specific non-free tools to do this?

Ok, thanks. Please let me know what pages are changed if you are done.

Can the Web Site by itself not be a CVS project? That way it's very
simple to work with more people on it. What do you think?

No, just a text editor. ;-)
I use Microsoft Frontpage to make the pages. I asume any editor can be
used.

Good point. Let the speakers/talkers talk their business there. That
will save bandwidth. Telephone bill is very high here. I ought to save

I do not believe that it is me alone who feel sick about many lengthy

Why not we split to more specific segments in accordance to the list

are expert in legal part go to another list.

At the end of the day we'll meet again to compile everything.

There are, to the best of my knowledge, no "legal experts" here. What
"legal" discussion does take place directly affects all developers. It is a
developer issue. Legal discussion has to take place on the developer's list
or not at all.

The "shits", as you so colourfully put it, are an unfortunate side affect of
one small aspect of such a discussion. Moreover, the "shits" have also
happened out of development issues (the just-solved problem was as much to
do with development as it was "legal" issue). It seems to me that you're
confusing general disagreement with "legal discussion".

Moving a development issue to a different list won't stop general
disagreement but it will move a developer issue out of the developer's
mailing list.

Yes, that's exactly what I was hopping I could do too. But sadly, even if
you add a new special marker for macro, I couldn't find a way to do it. You
see, if you have 2 markers 1 for pure expressions, and another for macro
expressions, the output logic of the preprocessor will distort the order of
the list, because each marker produces its repeating results separately.

Consider this:

#command LIST [& <macro> [,] ] [<exp>[,]]                                  ;
         [<off:OFF>]                                                    ;
         [<toPrint: TO PRINTER>]                                        ;
         [TO FILE <(toFile)>]                                           ;
         [FOR <for>]                                                    ;
         [WHILE <while>]                                                ;
         [NEXT <next>]                                                  ;
         [RECORD <rec>]                                                 ;
         [<rest:REST>]                                                  ;
         [ALL]                                                          ;
                                                                        ;
      => __dbList(                                                      ;
                   <.off.>, { [<{exp}>,] [<(macro)>,] }, .t.,          ;
                   <{for}>, <{while}>, <next>, <rec>, <.rest.>,         ;
                   <.toPrint.>, <(toFile)>                              ;
                 )

(It doesn't work as it should, with Clipper or Harbour, but you can try it
with PP. Regardless it should explain the point)

You will quickly find that:

LIST Field1, &cField, Field2

Will be converted to:

__dbList( .F., { {|| Field1 }, {|| Field2 }, "cField", }, ... )

There is no way to synchronize the order of the separated repeating markers.

If you find a way to do so with the Preprocessor, while keeping 100% Clipper
compatibility and not forcing macro evaluation of all non macro expressions
(the whole list), please feel free to replace my implementation.

  First, I think that we don't have to be 100% Clipper compatible if we 
(you) have broke already this compatibility here with the macro list.
Second, I was thinking about something like:

#command LIST [<list,...>]      ;
         [OFF]                  ;
         [TO PRINTER]           ;
         [TO FILE <toFile>]     ;
         [FOR <for>]            ;
         [WHILE <while>]        ;
         [NEXT <next>]          ;
         [RECORD <rec>]         ;
         [REST]                 ;
         [ALL]                  ;
                                ;
      => XLIST [<&list&>]       ;
         [ OFF]                 ;
         [ TO PRINTER]          ;
         [ TO FILE <toFile>]    ;
         [ FOR <for>]           ;
         [ WHILE <while>]       ;
         [ NEXT <next>]         ;
         [ RECORD <rec>]        ;
         [ REST]                ;
         [ ALL]

where XLIST will be renamed current LIST command. 
The new extended marker <& &> should remove the macro operator.

Minor correction, I agree that your decision to support the full scope of
expression syntaxes in Harbour macro was right, but I'm left puzzled, why
would you hold me responsible for this? I'm not responsible for 99% or more
of such macro incompatibilities*.

*I don't refer to what you did as "broke compatibility" because I don't
think Harbour must be ERROR COMPATIBLE with Clipper to be considered
compatible.

How would you know if the resulting output <&list&> was originally macroed
or not?

The only way I can see is if <&list&> was a blockify unless macro, but
that's not what you indicated.

I know you can make WinCE applications with Visual C++. And we can make
a Harbour with Visual C++, so... ;-)

Will do. Where can I find the source for the pages? Can I simply modify the
source of a page as it is downloaded from the web site?

I think it's an excellent idea. A couple of projects on SourceForge that I
know of do this and it seems to work well.

Presumably Frontpage doesn't store any external data regarding the pages?
Hacking the HTML by hand isn't going to break your Frontpage or anything?

Using it:

| #include <stdio.h>

I'll give it a go and see if it makes a difference.

Or I can ZIP the HTML pages, or you can just get them form via the
Harbour-Project FTP site. They are both the same.

If we changes some HTML pages, we have to update the CVS AND the FTP?

No, There's nothing special in the code that is for Frontpage. Just go

Whereabouts on the ftp site can I find the html?

Question to Phil: Can the box handle rsync? If not, any chance of installing
it?

If there was a CVS server on Phil's box and we did web page CVS there it
wouldn't be impossible to make the public html directory a symbolic link to
the CVS (Phil might want to ponder any security issues regarding that idea).
If we did CVS on SourceForge it wouldn't be that difficult to set up a cron
job to sync the web site with CVS every so often.

Phil, any thoughts in this direction?

Excellent. I'm tied up with other stuff till mid-week or so and next weekend
is busy. I'll try and get the tweaks I have in mind done either today or

I know you can make WinCE applications with Visual C++. And we can make

  Please notice that you were requesting 100% Clipper compatibility in 
LIST command context where we are not compatible already due to your 
changes. Even more - it is possible that your changes will break many 
existing code simmilar to this:

cMacro :="otheralias->(DBSEEK(currentalias->somewhere)),otheralias->field"
LIST currentalias->somewhere, &cMacro

since this will print the result of DBSEEK() call.

  I was pointing the general idea. We should create tools that can be 
reused instead of creating an exceptional handling at the very low level 
that cannot be disabled or configured by the harbour user.

  Just to add some more examples of valid code that will be interpreted 
incorrectly now:

cMacro :="otheralias->(DBSEEK(somewhere),somefield)"
cmacro :="someFunct(anyarg,otherarg)"

  So this means that we are really solving the wrong problem here.

Hi,

This is the fixed function ( and in all hb_stor  functions are the same).

What's next? Can I correct all functions or this tip is this enough?

      PHB_ITEM pItem = ( iParam == -1 ) ? &hb_stack.Return :
hb_stackItemFromBase( iParam );

      if( HB_IS_BYREF( pItem ) )

Ricardo,

This way the "hb_itemPutNI( pItem, iValue )" branch will run even 
if the parameter was not passed by reference, and the function will 
behave differently when a -1 is passed as iParam, if the return value 
is an array. These differences should be checked against CA-Cl*pper.

I wrote some "bit-string" code for the GT library, perhaps that's easily
ported to harbour?

Please stop misleading the group. I was very polite in correcting you at
least twice already. Harbour macro compiler is not 100% Clipper compatible
in *every* function of the language, in *every* expression of the language,
and to be exact *every* *where* a macro can be used, and not just __dbList()
as you are trying to mislead the group to believe.

These incompatibilities are only to do with errors, and I do not consider
them incompatibilities myself, but please do *not* try to attribute them to
me, there are *your* *work*!

I'll gladly post a sample of *dozens* of such incompatibilities, and how
they affect *every* function that Harbour offers, and *none* related to
anything I contributed, should you need me to refresh your memory.

As it should. Before my enhancments this would have produced an error due to
rejection of list as acceptable macro expression.

To avoid the output of dbSeek(), the correct form of this (in both Clipper &
Harbour) is:

cMacro :="(otheralias->(DBSEEK(currentalias->somewhere)),otheralias->field)"
LIST currentalias->somewhere, &cMacro

Why didn't you do as you advise me to do, with _GET_()? Can you please
explain why did you create an exception at the very [same] low level, and
why can it not be used or configured by the Harbour user?

No it simply means you have no clue about the logic involved, or you just
want to continue misleading those that are not familiar with the issue.

Incase you didn't know, let me explain that the above had to do with a
simple oversight in __dbList() which was corrected by: 2001-07-30 10:15

  Ron, we are talking about __dblist() behaviour now so please stop 
bringing a different issue. You know very well that making macro compiler 
100% Clipper compatible is very simple - I can do it for you.

  Ron, have you *checked* it with Clipper?

  Ron, have you really *checked* it with Clipper?

  With _GET_ we stay compatible with Clipper, with __dlist() we stay 
compatible with other xbase dialects that you are targeting and what is 
not the Harbour goal (unless something changed latelly).

rsync is not running as a daemon, but it is installed.

rsync version 2.4.1 Copyright Andrew Tridgell and Paul Mackerras

rsync is a file transfer program capable of efficient remote update
via a fast differencing algorithm.

That would be my choice... I can do that quite easily.

I believe there are security concerns regarding CVS on production 
web servers. Last time I looked into it I saw vague references to 
security concerns, but never anything specific and no exploits. I 
was about to install CVS on that server a couple of months back 
when it looked like Source Forge was in trouble.

Hi,
yesterday I updated my repository to test the -go switch while building
Harbour: it worked fine and failed only with dblist.prg because there is
inline c code on it.

We should include something like #define __INLINEC__ in hbsetup.h to
allow us to build Harbour itself with other switches than -gc and to
allow us to choose if we want the InlineC support in Harbour.

WM_Regards,
José Lalín

I removed the inline and placed the c code in arrayshb.c.

BTW, what is the problem compiling an inline c code? Aren't you calling the
c compiler first when using the -go?

We are talking about how enhanced macro functionality can cause unintended
side effects, which could be described as a incompatibilities [by those not
aware of the documented enhancements].

Here is just 1 example of how __dbList() will produce different results with
Harbour when compared with Clipper, that is not related to the macro list
support:

   //cGoodCond := "FIELD->Age == 30"
   cBadCond  := "FIELD->Age -= 30"
   LIST Field->Age FOR &cBadCond

Needless to say there are numerous similar issues.

As to reducing macro functionality, no thanks I can do it too, but that
would be a terrible mistake.

The above talks about Harbour not Clipper. Did you check what this would
have produced with Harbour before my change?

No I didn't, I'm sure you were just as surprised to find that Clipper's
macro does not support ( exp ), and your point would be? Isn't this the
*documented* syntax for achieving the above?

Please explain why then Clipper compatibility was not good enough for you
when designing the macro compiler?
Please explain why then Clipper compatibility was not good enough for you in
the case of early/late macro binding?

   When I implemented a 100% Clipper compatible you said:

   ,------------------<3A0AEA89.78C7802F@imid.med.pl>---------------------
   |As pointed by Ron we didn't support this Clipper feature . Currently
   |only Simplex version is compatible with Clipper here. However this is
   |just a copy of Clipper behavior. This limits the usage to very simple
   |expressions. For example Clipper compiles:

   |LOCAL macro

   |however doesn't compile
   |{|| &macro+1}
   |or
   |{|var| &macro+var}

   BTW, it's been more then 8 months after I implemented this *necessary*
compatibility
   feature, and we still don't have it in Flex build, due to your odd
position.
   /* Just try tests/tstblock.prg with Clipper and Harbour (SimpLex and Flex
builds) */


Please explain why then Clipper compatibility was not good enough for you in
the case of RDD?

Thanks, I'll take a look. Was that in SOURCE\RTL\GT ?

I am using ADS RDD but perhaps the problem is just HARBOUR.  If I "SET =
ORDER TO 1" on a database which has no indices open and there exists an =
index with the same alias it will be opened and set as the index.  This =
does not happen in CLIPPER.  This little anomaly cost me a couple of =
days of work because it looked like ADS was auto opening indices and it =
took a while for me to notice I had a SET ORDER TO 1 command in my =
general purpose dbf opening routine.

Thanks
